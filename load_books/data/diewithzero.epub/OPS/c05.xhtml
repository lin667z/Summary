<h2 class="chaptersubtitle paired">Rule No. 5:</h2>
<h2 class="pairedtop notop sectionsubtitle">Give money to your children or to charity when it has the most impact.</h2>
<p class="left ">Every single time I talk about dying with zero, I get some version of the same question: What about the kids? This question always comes up, without fail, no matter who I talk to.</p>
<p class="follow">A couple of variations of this question even have a moralizing, self-sacrificial tone. Some people have actually said to me, “Well, that’s what somebody would say who doesn’t have kids.” And even when they know I have children—two daughters—some people will still imply that dying with zero is the ultimate act of selfishness. No matter how they put it, what most people who ask about the kids mean is this: Planning to die with zero <a id="p78"/>might be good for someone thinking only about themselves, but shouldn’t you care about the well-being of your children, too? Because if you cared about someone other than yourself, you wouldn’t die with zero. You would make sure to leave money for the kids. Their implication: If dying with zero is a philosophy only for selfish bastards, then it can’t possibly be the right philosophy for decent, caring people like themselves.</p>
<p class="follow">That’s the holier-than-thou attitude I hear from so many people, and I have no patience for it, because it’s so hypocritical. Too often, people who make comments about the kids to argue against the Die with Zero way aren’t actually putting their children first but instead are treating their kids as an afterthought. Why do I say that? Well, let me give you an example from a typical conversation with my closest friends.</p>
<p class="follow">When one of these good friends poses this inevitable question—“What about the kids?”—I first explain that the money you’re leaving to your kids is <em>not</em> your money. So when I say you should die with zero, I’m not saying: Die with zero and spend all your kids’ money along the way. I’m saying: Spend all <em>your</em> money.</p>
<p class="follow">That is, give your children whatever you have allocated for them before you die. Why wait until you’re gone?</p>
<p class="follow">Remember, these are conversations I’m having with my closest friends, and we always call each other out on our BS. So I tell them straight out, “You’re full of BS! Where’s your trust fund for your kids? How much is it set to? When is it going to distribute? <em>Have you even thought about these things, or are you just parroting what you’ve heard?</em>”</p>
<p class="follow">Do you see what I’m saying? If you’re really putting your kids first, as you claim you are, don’t wait until you’re dead to show your generosity. (I like to say that dead people can’t give money <a id="p79"/>away—they can’t do anything.) Putting your kids first means you give to them <em>much earlier,</em> and you make a deliberate plan to make sure that what you have for your children reaches them when it will make the most impact. A real plan for dying with zero includes the kids, if you have kids. That way, you’ve already separated out their money (which becomes untouchable by you) from your money, which is what you must spend down to zero. That’s my short answer to the question about the kids. The rest of this chapter provides the full version.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Dying to Give the Money Away: The Problem with Inheritances</h2>
<p class="left ">When people bring up the kids, they’re saying that anyone planning to die with zero won’t leave a bequest—the kids won’t get an inheritance, and what a terrible outcome for the children that is. The crazy thing is that these are often the same people who say you should save as much as you can for your retirement because you don’t know when you’ll die. Well, if you don’t know when you’ll die, and you care so much about your kids, why do you want to wait until that random date for your offspring to get what you want them to have? In fact, what makes you so sure that all of your kids will even be alive by the time you die?</p>
<p class="follow">This is the problem with inheritances: You’re leaving too much to chance. Remember, life can be extremely fickle. Regardless of the amount you’re passing on, it takes a great deal of luck for it to arrive exactly when each of your recipients needs the money most. Much more likely, the money will arrive too late for it to have maximum impact on the recipient’s quality of life.</p>
<p class="follow">What would you guess is the most common age for peo<a id="p80"/>ple to get an inheritance? Well, people at the Federal Reserve Board track such things, and here’s what they find: For any income group you look at, the age of “inheritance receipt” peaks at around 60.<a id="px1759"/> In other words, if you were betting on how old someone will be when they inherit money—assuming you know nothing else except that they stand to inherit—60 is your best bet. (That’s a natural result of the fact that the most common life span is 80 and the most common age gap between parents and children is 20, the report points out.)</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, there’s a spread around that peak of age 60—many people who get an inheritance get it earlier than that, and many get it later. Overall, the data falls into more or less a normal (bell-shaped) distribution. So for every 100 people who inherit at around age 40 (which is 20 years before the age of peak inheritances), there are 100 people who inherit around age 80! It’s true that some people may be getting inheritances from people other than their parents—the older the recipients are, the more likely that is to be the case. But it doesn’t matter—whether people are getting inheritances from their parents or from someone else, the data clearly shows many people getting inheritances late in life, and that is suboptimal.</p>
<p class="follow">The upshot of all this is that if you wait until you die to have your children inherit your money, you’re leaving the outcome to chance. I call it <em>the three Rs</em>—giving <em>random</em> amounts of money at a <em>random</em> time to <em>random</em> people (because who knows which of your heirs will still be alive by the time you die?). How can randomness be caring? It’s the opposite of caring: Being okay with leaving all these outcomes to chance means you evidently don’t care if you spend years of your life working for future random people, and it means you may not care how much the people closest to you will actually get, or when. In fact, by leaving <a id="p81"/>all these things to chance, you’re even increasing the odds that whatever you’ve got to give will arrive too late to do much good in your kids’ lives.</p>

<p class="follow">My colleague Marina Krakovsky, who has helped me in the research and writing of this book, read an article about a woman who was in dire financial straits, even though her mother had plenty of financial resources.<a id="px1758"/> Marina tracked the woman down and, well, here’s what Marina found out:</p>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<blockquote class="extract1"><p class="left ">For many years after her divorce, Virginia Colin struggled financially.<a id="px1757"/> Receiving almost no child support from her ex, she raised her four children on her own, “mostly at the edge of poverty,” as she puts it. She eventually remarried, was able to hold down a decent part-time job, and attained financial stability. Then, when she was 49, her mother died, at age 76, leaving Virginia with a large inheritance: Virginia is one of five children, and each of them received $130,000. “I think the $650,000 was the maximum that you could get from one per<a id="p82"/>son’s estate without incurring some kind of estate tax,” Virginia points out, suggesting that her parents had most likely accumulated even more wealth than the total bequeathed to Virginia and her siblings.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="extract1"><p class="follow">The $130,000 windfall was definitely welcome—no question about that. “But it just would have been a lot more valuable a lot earlier,” says Virginia, who is now 68. “I wasn’t at the edge of poverty anymore—we weren’t rich, but by this time we were living a comfortable lower-middle-class life.” The money was now more like a nice bonus rather than the lifeline it would have been a decade or two earlier.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">What a sad situation: Here was somebody who, for many years, barely had enough to feed herself and her children—while her parents had lots of money but, like so many others in our culture, just wanted to wait until they died to give it to her.</p>
<p class="follow">Virginia’s parents are no longer around, so we can only guess what they would say if they heard me talking about dying with zero. If they’re like most people I’ve spoken with, chances are they would say, “But what about the kids?”</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Is</h2>
<p class="left ">I know I might sound harsh when I talk about this stuff. My goal isn’t to go around calling everyone a hypocrite. Most people have good intentions for themselves and for their kids—and if they’re hypocrites, it’s only by accident, because they fail to act on those good intentions. That’s true every time you say one thing but do something else, whether or not the disconnect is deliberate. For example, in your heart of hearts, you want to enjoy your <a id="p83"/>free time, but in reality you spend a good chunk of it checking your work email. Or you say you want to provide financial security for your kids, but in the end you leave it to random chance whether and how much your kids will actually get from you.</p>
<p class="follow">The Die with Zero way, on the other hand, makes sure that you deliver on your good intentions. It’s a more thoughtful approach in both senses of the word: It simultaneously shows seriousness <em>and</em> caring. When it comes to the kids, Die with Zero shows thoughtfulness by having you put your kids first, which you do by thinking deliberately about how much to give them and then doing so, before you die.</p>
<p class="follow">This is radically different from how many, if not most, people in the United States approach the question of giving money to their children. Yes, some people transfer money to their kids instead of waiting until their own death—but these “in vivo” (between the living) transfers, as economists call them, make up a small minority of all wealth transfers. The vast majority—between 80 and 90 percent, depending on the year—of households that received some type of wealth transfer in the years 1989 through 2007 received an inheritance.<a id="px1756"/> (I’d prefer the percentage to be zero, but realistically I would be happy to see it at 20 percent, since some people die early.) And it’s not at all clear whether the benefactors actually meant to leave that much to their heirs. Economists who study data on bequests say that when people leave money to their children and grandchildren, their motives appear to be some mix of intentional and unintentional. The intentional part is what you give because you want your kids to have a certain amount of money. The unintentional part is just a random by-product of precautionary saving—someone was saving money for unexpected medical expenses, for example, but ends up dying without spending all those savings, and the kids get <a id="p84"/>those financial leftovers. And when economists look at the data on actual bequests, it’s hard to tell whether any particular bequest was intentional or not.<a id="px1755"/> That’s because in the end, both types of bequests look the same. All you know is that a living person got a certain amount of money from the estate of a dead person.</p>
<p class="follow">It’s not just that economists and recipients can’t tell what’s intentional—what bothers me is that the givers themselves aren’t really clear on this. I say that because if you are clear about your intentions, you will <em>not</em> commingle intentional gifts with unintentional ones (leftover savings) in a bequest. Instead, you will figure out what you want to give—and you will give it <em>well</em> <em>before you die.</em> Do you want your daughter to get $50,000 of your wealth, or only $20,000? Whatever the amount is, if your intention is to give it to her, then I encourage you to act on your positive intentions by actually giving her that amount. Be intentional with your kids just as I am urging you to be deliberate with yourself. Put your money where your mouth is.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">The Enemies of Rational Thinking: Autopilot and Fear</h2>
<p class="left ">Why don’t more people act more deliberately when it comes to their kids and financial gifts? One reason is just autopilot, the antithesis of deliberate action. Autopilot is easy, and it’s what most people around you are doing. So when you look around and do what everyone else is doing, you’ll be coasting on autopilot just like everyone else. In fact, you might not even realize you’re doing it. The sad truth is that many people aren’t as deliberate as they could be with their own lives, so they’re not as deliberate as they could be with their children, either.</p>
<a id="p85"/>
<p class="follow">But even if you’ve stopped to really think about what you want for your kids, and have the best of intentions, you’ve got to overcome another powerful force pushing against rational thought and deliberate action: fear. This is exactly what kept Virginia Colin’s parents from sharing their wealth when she was on the edge of poverty. “My dad grew up as the son of an immigrant from Germany, during the Depression,” Virginia explained, “and he was afraid of not having enough even when they had more than enough. What if there was a huge, expensive medical problem?”</p>
<p class="follow">As it turned out, Virginia’s father did live into his nineties—outliving Virginia’s mother—but although he had some big medical problems, private insurance and Medicare covered most of the cost.</p>
<p class="follow">I know that’s easy to say in retrospect. Maybe he was just lucky. What if he’d had a particularly costly disease, like Alz­heimer’s, which typically requires expensive long-term care? Wouldn’t he have needed his savings for that? As noted earlier, if that’s the main reason you feel compelled to keep saving and saving, remember that you can buy long-term care insurance, which costs far less than self-insuring by saving massive amounts of money for a crisis that may never come. Just like any other kind of insurance.</p>
<p class="follow">In any case, Virginia learned from her parents’ experience: Don’t wait until you’re dead to give your money away. With her five children and stepchildren, ranging in age from 29 to 43, she and her husband make a point of giving them money sooner rather than later, depending on their needs. “If you get [the money] when you are 30,” she rightly points out, “you can buy a nice house and raise your kids in the environment you want to raise them in, and not have to scramble the way I did.”</p>
<a id="p86"/>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Timing Is Everything</h2>
<p class="left ">As Virginia’s story illustrates, timing is key. We’ve already established that waiting until you die is not optimal—so what is the optimal time to give money to your children?</p>
<p class="follow">Certainly it’s easier to say what is suboptimal. Most people who have assets to give to children wouldn’t give them to a 12-year-old, or even a 16-year-old. It’s pretty obvious that children and most teens are too young to manage wealth.</p>
<p class="follow">But of course that doesn’t equate to “the later the better.” I don’t want to say there’s an age when it’s just too late to give your children money—late, after all, is better than never—but age 60 is worse than 50, and 50 is worse than 40. Why? Because a person’s ability to extract real enjoyment out of the gift declines with their age. This happens for exactly the same reason your own ability to convert money into enjoyable experiences diminishes after you get past a certain age. And for a whole host of activities, you need a certain minimum mental and physical state to enjoy them at all.</p>
<p class="follow">So, for example, if the <em>peak utility of money</em> (the time when it can bring optimal usefulness or enjoyment) occurs at age 30, then at age 30 every dollar buys you one dollar’s worth of enjoyment. By age 50, the utility of money has declined considerably: Either you would get a lot less enjoyment out of that same dollar or you would need more money (say, $1.50) to obtain the same amount of enjoyment as you got out of $1 back when you were a healthy, vibrant 30-year-old. For the same reason, as your adult children age, every dollar you give them goes less far, and at some point that money becomes almost useless to them.</p>
<a id="p87"/>
<p class="follow">Let’s look at a more specific example. Suppose you ignore my advice about giving money to your kids before you die, and you want to take the more traditional route of leaving some money to your children after you die. Now assume that your life expectancy is 86, and that your oldest child is 28 years younger than you—so they’ll be 58 when you die and they inherit. At this point, they’re well past their peak of extracting enjoyment out of that money. Now, I don’t know the exact age of this peak, but based on what I know about human physiology and mental growth, between the ages of 26 and 35 seems about right, and 58 is clearly past that optimal point.</p>
<p class="follow">I actually did an informal Twitter poll recently in which I asked people what their ideal age was to receive an inheritance windfall, and most of them agreed. Of the more than 3,500 people who voted on this question, very few (only 6 percent) said the ideal age to inherit money is 46 or older. Another 29 percent voted for ages 36 to 45, while only 12 percent said 18 to 25. The clear winner, with more than half the votes, was the age range 26 to 35. Why? Well, some people mentioned the time value of money and the power of compound interest, suggesting that the earlier you get the money, the better. On the other hand, a bunch of people pointed out the immaturity problem of getting the money too young. And to those two concerns, I would add the element of health: You always get more value out of money <em>before</em> your health begins to inevitably decline. Bottom line? The 26-to-35 age range combines the best of all these considerations—old enough to be trusted with money, yet young enough to fully enjoy its benefits.</p>
<p class="follow">What I’m pointing out is the stark contrast between what people say they want . . . and what the U.S. inheritance data shows most people actually get. You can’t always get what you <a id="p88"/>want—but I’m talking to <em>you</em> as the prospective giver. If you have the means to give money to your children, then you have the power to control when they receive it. So don’t waste that opportunity! Whatever you give your heirs past their optimal age of receiving has less value to them. If you’re trying to maximize the impact of the money you give—instead of just maximizing the absolute dollar amount you give—then you should aim to give the money as close to their peak as you can.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, you might disagree with me about the right age to begin to turn assets over to your kids. But even so, you must acknowledge the decreasing value to your offspring with respect to time. Just take it to the extreme: the case of your leaving money after living a very long life. Does it make sense to wait and leave money to a 76-year-old? No, most people would say that’s too old. (My friend Baird has a mother who’s 76 and knows she can’t spend her money before she dies—the last trip she took lasted five days, and that was two days too long, he says. Since her money is of limited use to her, she has been trying to give it away to Baird, who is 50—but by this point, Baird really doesn’t need the money anymore!)</p>
<p class="follow">Optimization doesn’t care whether we’re talking about parents or children: The same principles, such as the declining value of money, apply to everyone. If your goal is to maximize what you get out of your life, it makes sense to want to maximize what your kids get out of their lives, too. So if you want to make the most of your gifts to your kids, you have to consider each recipient’s age. By applying this line of thinking, you will be taking money that is nonproductive in terms of life enjoyment and turning it into money that is maximally useful.</p>
<p class="follow">This is exactly what I’m trying to do with my own kids. For my daughters, who are not yet 25, I’ve funded an educa<a id="p89"/>tional savings plan (a 529 plan) and set up a trust. Mind you, the money in the trust is their money, not mine, and I contribute to it as I see fit, up to the maximum that I’m willing to give. My stepson is older—29—so he’s already received 90 percent of his “inheritance,” in the form of money he used to buy a house. (By the way, spreading out your giving in this way is totally fine. But I sure am not going to wait until he’s 65 to give him the rest!)</p>
<p class="follow">I do have a will, which is only for disposing of what I have in case I die unexpectedly. A while ago I realized I had money in my will for people who are older than me—my mom and my sister and my brother. That made me think: <em>What about now?</em> <em>Do I want to give anything</em> now, <em>when they can enjoy those gifts more than later?</em> My answer was yes, so I gave them that amount.</p>
<p class="follow">In short, by giving the money to my kids and other people at a time when it can have the greatest impact on their lives, I’m making it their money, not mine. That’s a clear distinction, and I find it liberating: It frees me to spend to the hilt on myself. If I want to spend like mad, I can do it without worrying about the effect on my kids. They have their money to spend as they wish, and I have mine.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Your Real Legacy Isn’t Money</h2>
<p class="left ">I spent much of this chapter talking about giving your money to your offspring—but that’s only because money is what most people are talking about when they ask, “What about the kids?” But remember, money is just a means to an end—a way to buy the meaningful experiences that make up your life. As I explained in chapter 2, I’m assuming that your goal in life is <em>not</em> to maximize your income and wealth but to maximize your life<a id="p90"/>time fulfillment, which comes from experiences and your lasting memories of those experiences. And just as you’re trying to maximize your own fulfillment, you’re trying to maximize your children’s fulfillment too.</p>
<p class="follow">The same holds for memories: Just as you’re trying to form memories of times with your kids, it makes sense to want your kids to form memories of you. Both sets of memories will yield a memory dividend—one stream of dividends for you and one for your kids. So how do you want your kids to remember you? That’s just another way of asking: What kinds of experiences do you want them to have with you?</p>
<p class="follow">That’s important to think about before it’s too late. Look at it from the perspective of the child deprived of experiences with the parent. A friend of mine received a massive fortune from his father, with whom he had almost no relationship while growing up, because the dad was always away chasing deals to build his fortune. So despite the family’s impressive wealth, my friend had a pretty miserable childhood. He was the classic poor little rich boy. The years of emotional neglect put a lasting strain on the father-son relationship: When the two did finally have time together, they found that they had trouble enjoying each other’s company. There was just no way to make up for all that lost time and attention. Now when my friend thinks of his father’s legacy, material wealth is one of the few things he recalls with any sense of gratitude.</p>
<p class="follow">It’s like the song “Cat’s in the Cradle.” The lyrics are just heartbreaking: The man telling the story basically missed his son’s whole childhood, because there were always “planes to catch and bills to pay.”</p>
<p class="follow">A lot of people quote from “Cat’s in the Cradle” because it is so emotionally moving and rings true for so many people who <a id="p91"/>hear it. I love the song, too, with its message that you can’t delay experiences with your kids indefinitely—but its message is incomplete. Yes, many of us are too busy chasing <em>x, y,</em> and <em>z</em> for the sake of future benefits, not realizing that the time to have meaningful experiences with our children is now. But it’s too simplistic to leave it at that, because there’s a limit to the benefits of spending additional time with your kids. You can’t delay everything, but you can delay some things.</p>
<p class="follow">I do believe firmly that your real legacy for your kids consists of the experiences you’ve shared with your children, especially when they’re growing up—the lessons and other memories you’ve imparted to them. But I don’t mean it in a schmaltzy, best-things-in-life-are-free way. In fact, the best things in life aren’t actually free, because everything you do takes away from something else you could be doing. Spending time with your family usually means <em>not</em> spending that time earning money—and the other way around. Instead, there are ways to think about experiences in a more quantitative way that will help you make better decisions about how to spend your time.</p>
<p class="follow">But before I get to that, let me make my main point clear: Of all the experiences you are trying to bequeath to your child, one of those experiences is time with you.</p>
<p class="follow">Time with you is crucial, because the memories your kids have of you have lasting effects, for better or worse. Scientists have known for some time that young adults who as young children receive more affection from their parents come to enjoy better personal relationships in general and to also have lower rates of substance abuse and depression. We also know that the positive effects of loving, attentive parents last well past young adulthood, thanks to a study of more than 7,000 middle-aged adults. Researchers asked these adults a bunch of questions <a id="p92"/>about their memories of their mother and father—questions like “How much time and attention did she/he give you when you needed it?” and “How much did she/he teach you about life?” and “How would you rate your relationship with your mother/father during the years you were growing up?”</p>
<p class="follow">Obviously, the higher a person’s ratings on questions like these, the more positive their childhood memories of that parent. So what did the researchers find? By correlating these ratings with answers to questions about particular outcomes, the researchers were able to conclude that those adults who had memories of higher parental affection ended up with better health and lower levels of depression.<a id="px1754"/> The word “experience” may not evoke images of a child being taught about life, or of simply being given time and attention—but all those are indeed experiences, too, and they’re indispensable, paying off in sometimes surprising ways. I don’t know anybody who wouldn’t want that kind of experience and that kind of memory dividend for their children.</p>
<p class="follow">So how do you quantify such things—what is the value of a positive memory? Your first instinct might be to say that it’s impossible to say, or that memories are priceless. But let me put it another way: What is the value to you of a week at a cabin on a lake? Or of a day with a beloved relative? The price might be extremely high or fairly low, but the fact that you can even propose a ballpark price says that the value of an experience can be quantified. (In fact, you might recall doing that with “experience points” in an earlier chapter.)</p>
<p class="follow">I am making a big deal about quantifying the value of experiences with your children because doing so forces you to pause and think about what’s <em>really</em> best for your kids: Sometimes it is earning more money, and sometimes it is spending more time <a id="p93"/>with them. So many people tell themselves that they are working for their kids—they just blindly assume that earning more money will benefit their kids. But until you stop to think about the numbers, you can’t know whether sacrificing your time to earn more money will result in a net benefit for your children.</p>
<p class="follow">What can thinking about the numbers tell you? Well, take an extreme example. Let’s say you live in the wilderness, and you must “go to work” to cut down trees just to build a basic shelter for your family. When you have to work just to enable your family to survive, of course it makes sense to work instead of hanging out with them. But once you get past the point of just working for basic needs and avoiding negative experiences, you can start to exchange your labor for positive life experiences. As far as your children are concerned, you can either work for more money to buy them experiences or spend your extra free time to give them the experience of time with you.</p>
<p class="follow">At the other extreme is the billionaire who works such long hours and travels so much for work that he spends no time at all with his children. If you’re already a billionaire, it’s safe to assume that your children would be better off if you spent at least a little more time with them, even if it’s to the detriment of your career. The financial cost to your career is small, but the benefit to your children is immense. So it’s a net gain to the family, including to you.</p>
<p class="follow">The value of time with your kids is like the value of water—if you’ve got 50 gallons of water, you wouldn’t pay a dime for an additional gallon of water. But if you’re dying of thirst in the desert, you might be willing to cut off your arm to get even one gallon.</p>
<p class="follow">Most of us, of course, are somewhere between these two extremes. We are neither working all the time just to survive <a id="p94"/>nor completely neglecting our children. As such, we are facing a more difficult trade-off between time and money. But the thought process should be the same as at the extremes, even if the answer isn’t obvious: Is each additional hour of work you do really worth it to you and your children? Does your work add to your legacy—or does it actually serve to deplete it?</p>
<p class="follow">Parents’ employment is a mixed blessing for kids of all income levels. When parents go to work, the income they earn can improve their kids’ lives in many ways, but as the economist Carolyn Heinrich points out, work (especially long hours and night shifts) can take time away from parent-child bonding and can bring real stress into children’s lives. And low-income parents are especially likely to be working stressful jobs with long hours.<a id="px1753"/> But, of course, most people have to work to provide for their families, and the optimal balance between time at work and time with your kids isn’t always obvious.</p>
<p class="follow">Where you and your children are in your lives matters, too. Just as you can’t keep delaying ski trips because there is a minimum level of basic health you need in order to go skiing, you can’t keep delaying time with your six-year-old, because eventually your child won’t be six. Or seven. Or a child. The fact that those opportunities gradually disappear should cause you to reevaluate how much money you’d be willing to give up to have those experiences.</p>
<p class="follow">Now look at it from your kids’ point of view, because it’s our kids’ fulfillment that we’re trying to maximize here. What do you suppose is the value to your child of an extra day with you? Or to have you home when she comes home from school? Or to have you attend her soccer game or music recital? I’m well aware that your kids, especially when they’re very young, probably don’t value these experiences when they’re having them. If <a id="p95"/>I were to ask my older daughter how much she values my going to one of her games, she might not even know what I was talking about. But these shared experiences clearly have a value, especially in retrospect. Remember: The purpose of money is to have experiences, and one of those experiences for your kids is time with you. Therefore, if you are earning money but not having experiences with your kids, you are actually depriving your kids. And yourself.</p>
<p class="follow">If you really think through the implications of saying that your legacy consists of experiences with your children, the conclusion you reach might be somewhat radical: That is, once you have enough money to take care of your family’s basic needs, then by going to work to earn more money, you might actually be depleting your kids’ inheritance because you are spending less time with them! And the richer you already are, the more likely this is to be true.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Charity Can’t Wait</h2>
<p class="left ">Guess what! Almost everything I’ve said about giving money to your kids at the right time applies to donations to charity. Whether the money or time you’re giving is to children, to charity, or to yourself, the key concept is the same: There is an optimal time, and it is never when you’re dead.</p>
<p class="follow">Consider this headline, above one of the most emailed <em>New York Times</em> stories in the week it came out: “96-Year-Old Secretary Quietly Amasses Fortune, Then Donates $8.2 Million.” Wow! The story explained how a Brooklyn woman named Sylvia Bloom managed to amass so much wealth on her salary as a legal secretary. Though she’d been married, she had no children, <a id="p96"/>and she worked for the same Wall Street law firm for 67 years, lived in a rent-controlled apartment, took the subway to work even into her nineties—and made her savings grow by replicating on a smaller scale the investments made by the lawyers she worked for.</p>
<p class="follow">Nobody close to Ms. Bloom had any idea of her wealth until after her death. She made a bequest of $6.24 million to a social service organization called the Henry Street Settlement; another $2 million went to Hunter College and a scholarship fund. Everyone at the Settlement was blown away. Bloom’s niece, who was the organization’s treasurer, was especially stunned. It was the largest single gift from an individual in the organization’s 125-year-history. The group’s executive director called the gift “the epitome of selflessness.”</p>
<p class="follow">Now, I understand where he’s coming from—it does seem selfless to leave so much money after living on so little, and a good deed is a good deed—but in all candor, I don’t see Bloom’s actions as the height of selflessness.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">You Can’t Be Generous When You’re Dead</h2>
<p class="left ">Before I explain why Bloom’s actions don’t seem all that selfless, let me explain that I can’t say whether someone’s decision is good or bad, rational or irrational, without knowing what the person wants. For example, I personally might prefer to give my time and money to people rather than to animals—but if someone would rather volunteer at an animal rescue than a homeless shelter, who am I to say that’s irrational? As long as what they do is consistent with what they actually want, I have to respect their <a id="p97"/>decision even if it’s not the decision I would have made. There’s just no accounting for taste.</p>
<p class="follow">Therefore, I can’t say that Sylvia Bloom made a mistake in working her whole life and scrimping to eventually have all that money go to someone else. We can only guess whether she was denying herself deliberately to give a larger gift to others (which would indeed be generous) or whether she was just living on autopilot, with her beneficiaries getting whatever was left (which would not be generous). Why? Well, once you’re dead, the transfer of your assets is legally enforced, and the only say you have in the matter (through your will, obviously created before you die) is where those assets get transferred. But your money is taken no matter what—so how can that be generous? The dead don’t pay taxes—only the recipients of their bequests do. So you can be generous only when you’re alive, when you have actual choices and their consequences: That’s when you can choose whether to give your money or your time to one thing or another. If you give generously when you’re alive, then I can consider you selfless. If you’re dead, you just don’t have that choice. So by definition, you cannot be generous when you’re dead.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">A Terrible Inefficiency</h2>
<p class="left ">Maybe you think I’m splitting hairs about the meaning of selflessness, generosity, and choice. Bloom did, after all, scrimp and save and put those charities in her will, so she must have had generous intentions, right? Okay. And it’s possible that she also received a lot of joy from saving that money with the knowledge that someday it would go to a cause she cared about—charitable giving, after all, is another way to have an experience.</p>
<a id="p98"/>
<p class="follow">So what’s the problem? The problem is terrible inefficiency: People who were needy during her lifetime did not benefit from her largesse. Here was a person who, by her own choice to consume very little of her growing wealth, routinely lived far below her means. She chose to keep taking the subway to work and to keep living in a rent-controlled apartment (which, incidentally, could have gone to a needier person). Let’s assume that she was saving specifically so that her money could go to these charities. So why didn’t she give it to her beloved charities earlier, when she clearly could have?</p>
<p class="follow">Well, maybe part of her motive for saving was precautionary—she might have thought there was a good chance she would need to spend $2 million at 72 to take care of herself. Or maybe she thought of the money growing in her accounts as some sort of score, a measure of how well she was doing, instead of a way to have an impact on the world. Or maybe she didn’t really think it through; after all, large grants at death are a deeply ingrained part of our culture. I don’t know—we can only guess. But I do know that her delay was inefficient, because her charities certainly could have put the money to use earlier, benefiting many more people sooner.</p>
<p class="follow">Think, for example, of the amazing gift Robert F. Smith gave to the class of 2019 of Morehouse College, paying off all their student loans. Whatever his motives were, whatever amount his gift added up to, the point is that Smith didn’t put it in his will—he gave while he was still very much alive, enabling <em>today’s</em> graduates to leave college debt-free.</p>
<p class="follow">Sylvia Bloom, too, gave to educational causes, which is particularly interesting for our purposes, because the benefits of investing in education are so well documented. The benefits accrue not just to individual students (who, as a result of educa<a id="p99"/>tion, can get better jobs and enjoy better health) but also to society as a whole. Lower rates of poverty and lower rates of crime and violence are just the most obvious social benefits of education.<a id="px1752"/> Economists have also tried quantifying the return on investment in education, finding that, worldwide, the social returns to schooling at the secondary and higher education levels are above 10 percent (per year).<a id="px1751"/> What other investment can yield such a reliably high rate of return? To justify holding on to the money and investing it on your own rather than giving it to your favorite educational charity now, you’d have to know that you can earn more than that rate of return year after year. Charitable organizations certainly prefer to get your money now. But some charities, particularly foundations and endowed nonprofits, don’t use the money they receive right away, either; instead, they aim to grow their endowments by taking in more than they give away each year. For example, in 1999, foundations took in more than $90 billion but distributed less than $25 billion. That is why one analysis concludes that “donors should ask not just how, but how soon, their gifts will be used.”<a id="px1750"/> I couldn’t agree more. But no matter how your favorite charity spends your money, the charity always gets more out of having the money sooner.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Your Legacy Is Now</h2>
<p class="left ">You already know my take on timing your spending in general: that it’s important. My number one rule is: Maximize your life experiences. So spend your money while you’re alive—whether it’s on yourself, your loved ones, or charity. And beyond that, find the optimal times to spend money.</p>
<p class="follow">When it comes to giving money to your kids, the optimal <a id="p100"/>time, as I suggested earlier in the chapter, is when they’re between 26 and 35—not too late to make a big impact and not so soon that they might squander the money. But what about giving money to charity? With charity, there’s no such thing as too soon. The sooner you give money to medical research, for example, the sooner that money can help combat disease—as we can see from the research into returns on investments in medical research.<a id="px1749"/> Every day, a new technological advancement happens that improves lives, and over time these advances make a huge difference. But you can’t just wait for these things to happen—you have to give what you can based on the resources you have today and the resources you expect to have in the future.</p>
<p class="follow">A friend of mine was telling me he wants to start a business, and if the business succeeds he wants to give the proceeds to charity. His goal with the business is to create a huge charitable impact. You can probably guess what I told him: that his charity needs his money now. If you have the money now to invest in a new business, and your whole point of investing in the business is to earn money for charity, you and the charity would both be better off if you just gave them your money right now—even if it’s less than what you might be able to give later. The suffering is happening now, so the time to start relieving it is now, not at some distant date in the future.</p>
<p class="follow">More and more philanthropists are taking this approach, which billionaire philanthropist Chuck Feeney calls “giving while living.” Feeney, who made his fortune as a founder of Duty Free Shoppers Group (the duty-free stores you see in airports), is a great role model for what I’m advocating: He started giving his money away (anonymously) early, and by the time he was in his eighties he had given away more than $8 billion of his wealth. He had chosen to live frugally, like legal secretary Sylvia <a id="p101"/>Bloom—but unlike Bloom, he didn’t wait until his death for that money to go to charitable causes. He’s now in his eighties, and by choice he and his wife live in a rented apartment. His net worth is now down to about $2 million—still plenty to sustain him for the rest of his life, but a tiny fraction of the money he gave away over the years.</p>
<p class="follow">Feeney has been an inspiration to many wealthy people, including Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. But you don’t have to be rich to give while living. The same principle applies at any scale, whether you have billions, thousands, or hundreds. It doesn’t take much money to make a noticeable impact on people in the developing world: Through organizations like Save the Children and Compassion International, you can sponsor a child for less than $500 per year, helping the child grow up safe, healthy, and better educated—and starting a positive cycle for future generations.</p>
<p class="follow">If you don’t have as much money to give away as you’d like, you still probably have <em>time</em> to give. So remember, when I say “die with zero,” I don’t mean die with the money that you’re going to give to charity. If you plan to give, give while you’re alive, and the earlier the better. Your charity can’t wait.</p>
