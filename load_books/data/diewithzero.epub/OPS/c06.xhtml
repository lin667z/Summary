<h2 class="chaptersubtitle paired">Rule No. 6:</h2>
<h2 class="pairedtop notop sectionsubtitle">Don’t live your life on autopilot.</h2>
<p class="left ">At the beginning of this book, I told you about the time my boss told me I was an idiot. As you might recall, I was a penny-pinching guy in my twenties, proud of myself for managing to save up money on my meager salary. My boss, Joe Farrell, knocked some sense into me by reminding me that I was on a path to earn much more in the coming years, so I was foolish not to spend whatever money I was making now.</p>
<p class="follow">Joe Farrell didn’t just make this advice up. The idea that it’s rational for young people to be freer with their money is shared by many economists, even though it runs counter to the advice most of us grow up hearing. When we’re around eight or nine <a id="p104"/>years old, our parents tell us to save some of our birthday money instead of spending it all. When we’re all grown up, financial advisers tell us it’s never too early to start saving part of our paychecks.</p>
<p class="follow">Many economists, on the other hand, think that thrift among young people is generally a bad idea. When economist Steven Levitt, of <em>Freakonomics</em> fame, landed at the University of Chicago as a first-year professor, a senior colleague named José Scheinkman told him he should spend more and save less—the same advice that Scheinkman himself had gotten from Milton Friedman, the even more famous University of Chicago economist. “Your salary will only go up, your earning power will only go up,” Levitt recalls his older colleague telling him, in almost a perfect echo of what Joe Farrell told me. “And so you shouldn’t be saving now, you should be borrowing. You should be living today in much the way that you’ll be living in 10 or 15 years, and it’s crazy to actually be scrimping and saving, which is what at least someone like me who was brought up in a middle-class family was taught to do.”<a id="px1767"/> Levitt says this was one of the best pieces of financial advice he ever got.</p>
<p class="follow">I’d say the same thing about the nearly identical advice Joe Farrell gave me, even though for a time I took it too far. Joe’s words opened my eyes to a whole new way of thinking about balancing your earnings with your spending. I was like a zealous convert—there was the me before that talk with Joe, and a very different me after. Before, I had been living much the way people in the FIRE movement are living today—doing everything on the cheap, watching every penny, and saving as much as I possibly could for the future. Then Joe’s words flipped a switch in me. Real fast, I swung from being a FIRE guy to a guy basically lighting money on fire. In the next few years, my income <a id="p105"/>kept rising, as Joe had said it would, and my spending kept rising, too.</p>
<p class="follow">I was having a lot of fun, but unfortunately I can’t point to a particular experience I had in those years that yielded much of a memory dividend. That’s because I was going bananas—just spending money to spend money, instead of being selective. For example, I’d buy a stereo system with a higher sound fidelity than my ears could perceive, or I’d go to restaurants that were more expensive but not that different from the restaurants I’d dined at before. Basically, if there was a more expensive version of something, I’d go for it without thinking about getting the maximum value. In effect, I just went from autopilot-save to autopilot-spend.</p>
<p class="follow">My spending also jeopardized my future. I wasn’t just spending all my discretionary income; I was also cutting deep into my emergency safety stash. What if I lost my job? Besides unemployment insurance, I’d have no cushion to lean on—not even one month’s salary.</p>
<p class="follow">I’m still a big believer in taking risks when you’re young enough to recover from the possible downside—but only if there’s an upside, a reward that makes the risk pay off. It’s always got to be risk/reward. So if I were going to Nepal, for example, to take a journey I’d never get to take again because later I’d have kids and other responsibilities, then that’s a risk worth taking. It’d be okay to spend all I had and even go into debt (like my friend Jason did for his backpacking trip through Europe) for that kind of once-in-a-lifetime experience. I wouldn’t call that lighting money on fire. But my spending at that time wasn’t anything like that: For what I was getting, the risk I was taking wasn’t worth it.</p>
<p class="follow">But you see why I went too far: In trying to avoid my ear<a id="p106"/>lier idiocy of depriving myself, I just became a different kind of idiot. In taking Joe’s wisdom and running with it, I was replacing one mistake with another: Earlier I was too thrifty, and later I was too spendthrift. The real wisdom of Joe’s advice isn’t to always spend everything you earn and to keep betting on an ever brighter future. No, the key takeaway, I now realize, is to <em>strike the right balance between spending on the present (and only on what you value) and saving smartly for the future.</em></p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Why Simple Balance Rules Don’t Work for Everyone</h2>
<p class="left ">I’ve also come to realize that this balance keeps shifting as you move through your life. That’s also quite contrary to most personal finance advice. For example, some financial experts urge you to save “at least 10 percent” of your income each month or each paycheck. Other experts will suggest other numbers, like 20 percent—but again, they suggest you do this every month or week or paycheck, regardless of your age or financial situation.</p>
<p class="follow">Let’s look at the 20 percent recommendation, which comes from a popular budgeting formula called the 50-30-20 rule.<a id="px1766"/> 50-30-20 comes from Elizabeth Warren—yes, that same Elizabeth Warren. Before she entered politics, Warren had been a law professor with special expertise in bankruptcy and also co-wrote books about why middle-class Americans go broke and how to avoid that dismal fate. She suggested the 50-30-20 rule, which she called the Balanced Money Formula, as a way to help people maintain financial stability.</p>
<p class="follow">According to this rule, you should budget 50 percent of your <a id="p107"/>income for must-haves (like rent, groceries, and utilities), 30 percent for your personal wants (like travel, entertainment, and dining out), and the remaining 20 percent on building your savings and paying down your debt. The rule sounds like a great (and simple) way to achieve that goal, especially for people who may not have a good grip on their spending. It certainly caught on. But if you want to go beyond financial stability—that is, if you share my goal of maximizing your lifetime fulfillment without going broke—then you’ll need a more sophisticated way of thinking about balance. To my way of thinking, no way can the same ratio of spending to saving be right for everyone—and, more important, no way should your savings percentage be the same when you’re 22 as when you’re 42 or 52. The optimal balance will vary from person to person and will shift as your age and income change. This chapter will show you several methods to help you find and maintain that optimal balance for yourself.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Why the Spend-Save Balance Keeps Shifting</h2>
<p class="left ">The 50-30-20 rule and other simple formulas suggest a constant ratio of spending to savings. For example, in the 50-30-20 rule, in which you save 20 percent of your income, the ratio is 80 to 20. If you take out the must-haves, meaning that the only spending you count is on wants (more or less what I call “experiences”), the ratio of spending to saving is 30 to 20. Why do I say that such a balance can’t be right throughout your life? Because it’s not an optimal allocation of your life energy. You already understand part of the reason if you agree with Joe Farrell and Steve <a id="p108"/>Levitt: It’s crazy to save 20 percent of your income when you’re young and have good reason to expect to earn much more in the next few years.</p>
<p class="follow">In fact, as Levitt suggests, it can even make sense to borrow money (spending more than you’re currently earning) when you expect to earn a lot more down the road.</p>
<p class="follow">And just to be clear: When I say it makes sense to borrow money when you’re young, I’m <em>not</em> saying you should be racking up credit card debt—such high-interest loans are a bad idea for almost everyone. Borrow modestly and responsibly. And when you have many years of rising income ahead of you, it really doesn’t make sense to save 20 percent of your income. That would mean forgoing memorable life experiences you could be having, and it also means working to pay for a richer future self—a suboptimal use of your life energy, that’s for sure.</p>
<p class="follow">Okay, suppose you agree with me that a balance of 80 to 20 is suboptimal for many young workers. But what about older workers? Obviously, at some point you will have to start saving for your retirement, when you’ll otherwise have little to no income. And it’s not just retirement you need to save for—there will almost always come times in your life when your income will hit a plateau, or your spending will need to rise, or both will happen at the same time. For all those eventualities, you do need to save money at some point, no doubt about it. When that time comes, you don’t want to save too much (because you’d be forgoing experiences you may never have again), and you don’t want to save too little, either (because that would deprive your future self). You want to save as close to the perfect amount as possible: You want to achieve the optimal balance between enjoying the present and providing for a good future.</p>
<p class="follow">But even when you do reach an age when it’s wise to start sav<a id="p109"/>ing, there will <em>not</em> be one magic number, an ideal constant savings rate that will keep you in balance until you retire. To understand why, you need to fully understand a concept I touched on earlier: A person’s ability to extract enjoyment from their money begins to decline with age. What does this mean? The idea becomes crystal clear when you look at a person on their deathbed. Too weak and fragile to move their body, perhaps needing a feeding tube and a bedpan for some of their most basic functions, the person on their deathbed can’t do much of anything except think back to what they’ve already done in their life. You can give them a private jet to anywhere in the world—but they’re just not going anywhere. Whether they’ve saved up a million dollars or a billion, the money won’t make a real difference in increasing their enjoyment of what they’ve got left in life. Admittedly, this is a grim way of looking at the end of one’s years. But it does put everything into sharp focus. At this point in life, the only person with less ability to extract enjoyment from money is the one in the morgue or the grave.</p>
<p class="follow">What does that have to do with you as a healthy 40-year-old or however old you are now? Everything! I often think about these deathbed scenarios because the fact that we all will die has implications for every day of our lives. We’ve all heard the hypothetical question “What would you do if you knew you were going to die tomorrow?” The person asking this question often follows your answer with “Why don’t you do these things now?” Well, the obvious answer is that you probably will <em>not</em> die tomorrow, so it’s foolish to act as if you will. In general, when you will die should affect how you spend your time.</p>
<p class="follow">As I mentioned earlier, if you knew you were going to die tomorrow, you’d spend today one way, and if it was two days from now, you would spend today slightly differently—because <a id="p110"/>you’ll still have tomorrow. The same is true for three days from now, four days from now, or 20,000 days from now: The further back in time you go, the more the balance shifts between living for today and planning for the future. So if you work your way back one day or year at a time, from your deathbed to the wheelchair to retirement, and then further back to your thirties, twenties, and so on, you should see at least subtle changes in how you should be spending your life. This is easy to see when you’re talking about a few days—those changes aren’t subtle. But when we’re talking about <em>thousands</em> of days—of years and decades—people tend to forget this logic altogether and act as if 20,000 days is the same as forever. But of course none of us have forever. We need to keep that in mind so that we take optimal advantage of the time we have and don’t fall into the trap of living our lives on autopilot.</p>
<p class="follow">Travel is a good example: To me, travel is the ultimate gauge of a person’s ability to extract enjoyment from money, because it takes time, money, and, above all, health. Many 80-year-olds just can’t travel much or far—their health prevents it. But you don’t need to be completely debilitated to want to avoid some of the hassles associated with travel. The less healthy you are, the less you’re able to cope with long flights, airport layovers, irregular sleep, and other travel-related stressors. A study of people’s travel constraints—what kept them from traveling to a specific destination—not only confirms this intuition but goes further. Some researchers asked people of different ages what prevented them from taking a trip. They found that people under age 60 are most constrained by time and money, whereas people 75 and older are most constrained by health problems. In other words, when time and money are no longer a problem, health is. And it’s not as if there comes one age at which people sud<a id="p111"/>denly start having health problems that prevent them from traveling. “Health problems were increasingly a constraint as age increased,” the researchers reported, “and were a major constraint to the oldest respondents.”<a id="px1765"/></p>
<p class="follow">It’s a harsh reality: Your health just keeps declining from your peak years in your late teens and twenties, sometimes suddenly but usually so gradually that you don’t notice it. When I was young, I loved playing sports, especially football. I still like football—but even as a healthy 50-year-old, I can’t possibly enjoy it as much as I did when I was 20. I can’t run as fast, and I’m much more prone to injuries. When you’re afraid of tearing a rotator cuff or busting your knee, football just isn’t as much fun. Friends who are around my age agree: At a certain point, your memories of having played football are a lot more pleasant than playing football.</p>
<p class="follow">This happens with all kinds of physical activities. Last week, I was playing tennis and noticed that my knees were kind of hurting, so I stopped. That wouldn’t have happened 20 years ago. My friend Greg, who loves skiing and is in great shape (for his age), recently went skiing for seven days in a row—something he could have done easily when he was 22—but afterwards he was in a lot of pain and realized that skiing seven days straight is too much for him now.</p>
<p class="follow">This diminished enjoyment from declining health also has a real impact on how far your dollar goes, and skiing is a good example of this effect. Let’s say that an aging skier decides to continue enjoying the sport by giving himself more breaks or longer breaks between runs. Great idea—but that doesn’t mean he’s getting the same experience as when he was younger and stronger. If he used to get in 20 good runs in one day on the slopes, now he can manage only 15. In effect, the same amount <a id="p112"/>of money he spent on that day of skiing now brings him only 75 percent of the skiing enjoyment it did years earlier.</p>
<p class="follow">My buddy Greg will recover and be able to ski again, but his future enjoyment will be diminished because he can’t ski as much as he used to—and eventually not at all.</p>
<p class="follow">I am reminded of this sad reality all the time because many people I know are noticing similar physical constraints sneaking up on them. I’ll tell you a particularly dramatic example. In the British Virgin Islands, on an island called Jost Van Dyke, there’s a great spot on the beach called the Soggy Dollar Bar. It has that name because there’s no dock; people anchor their boats a little ways offshore and literally swim up to the bar, paying for their famous Painkiller cocktail with wet dollars. Some people prefer to catch a ride on the back of a Seabob, which they can do, but if you like swimming, you get to have the full wet-dollar experience.</p>
<p class="follow">Well, that’s what my girlfriend’s granddad, Chris (aged 69 at the time), wanted to do when he came out to visit—he’s a former swim coach and was raring to go, so in he and I went, into the water. It’s a short swim, 30 yards or so, but about 20 yards in I heard Chris yell, “How much further?” I yelled back that he could stand (the water was shallow), but he didn’t hear me. When I got to him, he was breathing uncontrollably! I quickly thought about CPR, and whether we could get a defibrillator in time if this went south fast. Luckily, it didn’t come to that—Chris started to regain his composure, and after 15 minutes his breathing and heart rate were normal, so he and I were able to enjoy a Painkiller with our soggy dollars. Phew!</p>
<p class="follow">Chris and many others remember their glory days without noticing what is happening to their bodies—in Chris’s case, that he was not in shape to swim 30 yards. Many of us have this men<a id="p113"/>tal disconnect with reality, and the disconnect helps perpetuate the myth of endless go-go years in retirement, as if we’ll always be able to do what we enjoy doing.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, you might be saying, “That might be true for many people, but I’m in better shape than I was 20 years ago!” Well, to me that just says that you weren’t taking great care of your health earlier—because if you were, you definitely would have been in better shape 20 years ago. All other things being equal, a 20-year-old is healthier and stronger than a 40-year-old, and a 55-year-old is healthier and stronger than a 75-year-old. Those are just physical facts of life. Let me show you some evidence from medical research.</p>
<p class="follow">Different systems in your body deteriorate at different rates—but they all deteriorate. For example, when medical researchers track a population’s changes in bone density and muscle mass over time, they report different sets of numbers for the two measures. To complicate matters, they also find significant differences between groups of people. White females, for example, have lower bone density in their hips than do black females, and both groups have lower bone density than black males do. But all groups show a decline with age.</p>
<p class="follow">Researchers also track different indicators of eye health (visual function), such as contrast sensitivity, retinal thickness, and visual acuity. Lung function has its own trajectory of decline with age. So do cardiac health, cognitive function, and sense of smell, among many others. So there are many different health curves, not just one, and they all look somewhat different: Some decline in a steady, almost linear trajectory, while others are more curved, showing an accelerating rate of decline. Also, group differences aside, some individuals are healthier than others to begin with, and some are better at maintaining their health over <a id="p114"/>time, so ranges are more telling than single curves are. But no matter what specific health data you look at or how many curves you combine, 80-year-olds are <em>a lot</em> less healthy than 25-year-olds.</p>
<p class="follow">To some extent, the rate of physical health decline is up to you. The better you maintain your health, the less steep your decline. For example, the lung-function curve for nonsmokers is a lot flatter than the curve for smokers. The better your health in a given year, the more you will be able to enjoy your experiences that year. So, yes, you will decline—but you have a say in the shape of the decline! That’s a good thing, because the better you’re able to maintain your health during your lifetime, the higher your lifetime fulfillment score will be. But don’t kid yourself: No matter how much you take care of your body, you will not be in better health at 65 than you were at 25, assuming you were in normal health as a 25-year-old.</p>
<p class="follow">On a personal level, I’ve become even more deliberate in my decisions about what to do and when. The other day my friends and I rented a boat and I thought about wakeboarding, which is like snowboarding on water. At age 50, was I still in good enough shape to do it? Probably. Would I be in good enough shape seven years from now? Definitely not. This activity had to happen now or never, so I decided to go for it. I don’t want to get to the end of my days, when I no longer have my health, and realize there were things I wanted to do that I didn’t do earlier, when I was able to.</p>
<p class="follow">Your ability to enjoy many experiences in life depends on your health—but money plays a part, too, because a lot of activities cost money. So you’d better spend the money when you still have the health.</p>
<p class="follow">Here’s the point: Too many of us still view ourselves on an <a id="p115"/>ongoing basis as being in our twenties, even though our real age is somewhere in our fifties, sixties, or even seventies. While it’s admirable to view oneself as “young at heart,” it’s also necessary to be more realistic and objective about your body and how it’s aging. You <em>have</em> to be mindful and aware of your physical limits, and how they are steadily encroaching upon you as you get older, whether you like it or not.</p>
<p class="follow">I first started thinking about these things after that time I gave my grandmother $10,000 and discovered she just couldn’t spend it. All she really wanted to buy at that point was a sweater for me. I started noticing the same kind of thing with other older relatives, and I thought, <em>These are my ancestors, so I’m probably going to be that person, too, at some point.</em> And it occurred to me that <em>everybody</em> becomes like that eventually. As you get older, your health declines and your interests gradually narrow,<a id="px1764"/> just as your sex drive diminishes. Your creativity usually declines, too. And when you’re extremely old and frail, no matter what your level of interest is, just about all you can do is sit and eat tapioca pudding. At that point, money is useless to you, because all you need or want is to lie in bed and watch <em>Jeopardy.</em> This was my conclusion: The utility, or usefulness, of money declines with age.</p>
<p class="follow">It was also clear to me that the decline doesn’t start from birth. When we’re infants, we get very little enjoyment out of money. Babies are expensive to take care of, true, but it’s not like they get a lot of enjoyment from spending money. When you’re a baby, there’s no greater happiness than Mom and the crib. In a way, the amount of utility that babies get from money is very similar to what the elderly get. Money is nearly worthless at the very beginning and the very end of life.</p>
<p class="follow">What happens in between? When I was back in my twenties, <a id="p116"/>I could always find new things to do with money. Cash in your twenties has a lot of utility. So when I looked at these three points—the baby, the twenty-something, and the old person—I realized that <em>there must be a curve.</em> In other words, if the horizontal axis on a graph represents your age, and the vertical axis represents your capacity to enjoy life experiences that money can buy, then if you were to plot your potential enjoyment by age, you would see some kind of curve. Think of it this way: Given the same amount of money each year (let’s say $100,000), you will be able to extract a lot more enjoyment out of that money at some points in your life than at others. The utility of money changes over time, and it does so in a fairly predictable way: Starting sometime in your twenties, your health very subtly starts to decline, causing a corresponding decline in your ability to enjoy money.</p>

  <b>Ability to Enjoy Experiences Based on Health</b>

Everyone's health declines with age. Wealth, on the other hand, tends to grow over the years as people save up more and more. But worsening health gradually constrains your enjoyment of that wealth as more and more physical activities become impossible to enjoy, no matter how much money you can afford to spend on them.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">This thought immediately suggested practical implications: If your capacity to enjoy life experiences is higher at some ages <a id="p117"/>than others, then it makes sense to spend more of your money at certain ages than others! For example, because $100,000 has more value in your fifties than it does in your eighties, and your goal is to maximize your enjoyment of your money and your life, it’s in your best interest to shift at least some of that money from your eighties into your fifties. For the same reason, it’s in your best interest to shift some of it to your twenties, thirties, and forties, as well. Making these kinds of conscious financial shifts essentially creates a lifetime spending plan that takes into account the changing utility of money.</p>
<p class="follow">Whenever you shift in order to <em>spend</em> money, you are necessarily also shifting when you <em>save.</em> So, for example, instead of saving 20 percent of your income throughout your working years, some people would be better off saving almost nothing in their early twenties (as we’ve discussed), then gradually ramping up their saving rate during their late twenties and thirties as their income begins to rise. Then they should save even more than 20 percent in their forties—and then slow down their savings so that eventually (as I explain in the next chapter) they actually start outspending their earnings.</p>
<p class="follow">Notice that I am being careful to say that <em>some</em> people would be better off doing that. Everybody’s situation is different. For example, some people’s favorite activities, such as mere walking, are inexpensive; others don’t require tip-top physical health. How much you should save also depends on how fast your income grows from year to year, where you live, and how fast your savings grow. Because of all these variables, and all the possible combinations they produce, there is no one-size-fits-all rule.</p>
<p class="follow">There you have it: It makes sense to spend more of your money at some ages than others, so it makes sense to adjust your balance of spending to saving over the years accordingly.</p>
<a id="p118"/>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">The Real Golden Years</h2>
<p class="left ">We’ve all been told—like so many hardworking, diligent ants—that we need to save up our money for our “golden years” of retirement. But ironically, the real golden years—the period of maximum potential enjoyment because we have the most health and wealth—mostly come <em>before</em> the traditional retirement age of 65. And those real golden years are the years during which we should be doing most of our spending, not delaying gratification.</p>
<p class="follow">Too many people are making the mistake of investing in their future well past the point when those investments will ever pay off in ways that increase their overall lifetime fulfillment. Why do they persist? I think a lot of it is just the inertia (or, as I call it, autopilot) of doing what’s worked in the past. Sometimes it’s better to spend now, and other times you’re better off saving up (and investing) your money for a potentially better experience in the future.</p>
<p class="follow">At the extremes, this is easy to see: Obviously, if you keep hoarding your money and don’t spend any of it, your fulfillment curve will be minimal. And if you spend all your money now, you won’t have any for the future. It’s the Ant and the Grasshopper as I see the fable: There is a time to work (and save) and a time to play, and the optimal life requires planning for both survival and thriving. The grasshopper is so focused on thriving, on enjoying himself in the moment, that he forgets about survival and ends up living too short a life. But the ant is also making a big mistake: As a result of his hard work, he will live to see another year, but he is so preoccupied with survival that he doesn’t <a id="p119"/>get to enjoy summer and thrive. Neither extreme optimizes for lifetime fulfillment.</p>
<p class="follow">Understanding that moral is one thing, but putting it into practice is a different story. At any one point, it’s not easy to know which way to go. The optimal balance between saving and spending is not obvious at all. If you’ve spent decades dutifully saving and investing your money, it can be hard to stop—assuming you’re even aware that you should stop.</p>
<p class="follow">So what do you do? How do you achieve more balance in your life? I suggest several ways of thinking about the problem. Depending on who you are and how you think, different ones will resonate with you.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Balancing Health, Money, and Time Across Your Life</h2>
<p class="left ">Think about the three basics people need to have to get the most out of life: health, free time, and money. The problem is that these things rarely all come together at once. Young people tend to have abundant health and a good deal of free time, but they don’t usually have a lot of money. Retirees in their sixties, seventies, and beyond—the other end of the spectrum—have abundant time (and often more money than young people), but, unfortunately, they have less health, and thus a diminished ability to enjoy the time and money they do have than the young do.</p>
<p class="follow">What happens in between these two extremes? I think of this period as the real golden years because it usually includes a good combination of health and wealth. For example, a 35-year-old is still healthy enough to do most of the things a 25-year-old can do but typically earns a lot more. A 40-year-old (and, <a id="p120"/>even more so, a 50-year-old) generally has slightly worse health than a 30-year-old but still has a pretty high degree of health—and, generally, a higher income than either the 25-year-old or the 35-year-old. So people in these middle years—neither very young nor very old—typically have a different problem: They face a time crunch, especially if they have children at home. This time crunch is their biggest obstacle to having positive life experiences. Not that children don’t bring plenty of positive life experiences—they do—but between changing diapers, driving to various lessons and practices, and taking care of a larger household, there’s just less time for other experiences. The same is true if you don’t have children but find yourself working longer hours earning money than you did in your twenties.</p>

Each age tends to have a different balance of health, money, and free time. Because fulfillment requires reasonable amounts of all three, it’s a good idea at every age to trade an abundance of one (such as money) to attain more of the other two (such as buying more health or free time).

<p class="follow">Every group already does this to some extent, though I believe they often get the magnitude wrong. Specifically, young <a id="p121"/>people exchange their abundant time for money, sometimes to a fault—they should prize their free time more than most do. Old people spend a lot of their money trying to improve their health or to at least fight disease. People in the middle years sometimes trade money for time—and the more money they have, the more of it they should be using to buy time.</p>
<p class="follow">Most working people focus too much on getting more money. Let me explain why focusing on health and free time will yield more personal fulfillment.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Why Your Health Is More Valuable Than Your Money</h2>
<p class="left ">Nothing has a greater effect on your ability to enjoy experiences—at any age—than your health. In fact, health is actually a lot more valuable than money, because no amount of money can ever make up for very poor health—whereas people in good health but with little money can still have many wonderful experiences.</p>
<p class="follow">And that’s not just true in the extreme case of terrible health. Just being significantly overweight can put a damper on your enjoyment of life, if only because of all the extra pressure additional weight puts on your knees. I’ll bet you know people who, because of bad knees or weak muscles or just self-consciousness about their bodies, avoid many experiences that others around them take pleasure in, such as hiking or ziplining or delighting in the water and the sun on the beach. Or they go on the hike with everyone else, but they’re huffing and puffing, really struggling to eke out any kind of enjoyment out of this potentially fun activity. Some of these people might even have been athletes when they were younger; it’s just that when they stopped be<a id="p122"/>ing physically active, they continued to pile on the calories until they were 30 or 50 pounds overweight. It’s easy for that to happen, especially for people with jobs that consume most of their waking hours and energy and require sitting in front of a computer screen all day. And to what end? When the demanding job finally brings you financial success, do you still have the key ingredient (health) for enjoying that success?</p>
<p class="follow">Healthcare providers understand this problem better than most of us, just because of the many suffering patients they see. But even people working in healthcare aren’t immune to neglecting their own health. Let me give you just one example, this one with a happy ending. Stephen Stern, a chiropractor in Massachusetts who went public with his own decades-long struggles with weight, had been treating aching patients for decades and yet allowed his weight to yo-yo. He’d take up exercise and lose some weight, but then he’d stop exercising and gain all the weight right back, losing whatever physical fitness he had worked hard to achieve.<a id="px1763"/></p>
<p class="follow">When Stern was 59, he finally realized he couldn’t let this pattern continue—not if he wanted to avoid the fate of his less fortunate patients. As an article about him put it, “he’d seen patients his age and younger who’d lost the ability to do things they loved—not just through injury or illness, but often through simple neglect of their bodies. He knew that when people at this stage of life lost physical capabilities, often they never got them back.”</p>
<p class="follow">So Stern was determined to become fit again before he turned 60. This time he took a more gradual path to fitness than he had in the past; his body could no longer take the intense training regimens he’d put himself through in his younger years, but he could still regain a great deal of fitness through walking and calisthenics. And this slow but steady approach worked: His old <a id="p123"/>knee pains disappeared, and by age 66 he found that he could perform impressive feats of strength and balance, like a bent-knees handstand. His efforts at improving his fitness paid off in renewed confidence and competence—and in joyous experiences he wouldn’t otherwise have, like summiting mountains with his daughter. Though he can now do things most 30-year-olds cannot, he knows he’s never going to be as fit as a fit 30-year-old. What he’s actually accomplished is peak health for his age. “I’m an older man and I move the way an older man can move!”</p>
<p class="follow">Stories like Stephen Stern’s are inspiring—we all want to hear that it’s never too late. But that’s not why I’m telling you the story. The reality is that sometimes it really is too late to reverse decades of neglect and abuse, something Stern understood. And even when it’s not too late, it’s always better to have started investing in your health earlier. What I’m really trying to get across is that improved health improves everything in your life, makes every experience more enjoyable, at every age.</p>
<p class="follow">In our three-pronged model—where fulfillment from a single experience is a function of health, money, and free time—health is the single biggest factor (or multiplier) affecting the size of a person’s lifetime fulfillment curve: Our simulations show that even a small permanent reduction in health at some point in a person’s life amounts to a large reduction in the person’s lifetime fulfillment score.</p>
<p class="follow">Why would that be—why does health affect lifetime fulfillment more than either free time or money? When adjusting the health input, we are adjusting the rate at which your body will decline. How fast your body’s health declines depends on how in shape (or not) you are now. So if you are 2 percent from optimal health now, you may be 20 percent from optimal health 10 or 15 years from now. Basically, there is a compounding effect to <a id="p124"/>being in poor health. I don’t claim to be a doctor, but here is an example of how I see it working, and how it impacts your enjoyment of activities.</p>
<p class="follow">Let’s say you are 10 pounds overweight. That doesn’t seem so bad at first, but each pound of excess weight means four extra pounds of force on your knees. Ten pounds of excess weight is equivalent to 40 pounds of excess force your knees were not designed to handle. Naturally, over time, the cartilage in your knees will deteriorate and tear, and perhaps your bones will start to rub against each other. Your natural shock absorbers have been worn out, making it painful for you to walk for any extended period, and running is pretty much unbearable. This leads to more weight gain and other associated problems. It’s no wonder that knee replacement surgery is one of the fastest-growing surgeries in the USA, closely tracking the rise in obesity. In any case, that seemingly inconsequential ten pounds ballooned via compounding into other serious health problems and a lack of enjoyment of activities associated with walking.</p>
<p class="follow">As I’ve stated before, movement is life, and your experiences will be greatly diminished when your movement becomes painful or limited. There are many paths of decay until we ultimately die. We all wish to have the greatest physical function until we die, yet many of us will have greater exponential decay at an earlier time in our lives—resulting in lower ability and lower enjoyment—as a result of how we have treated our bodies. Einstein supposedly called compound interest the greatest force in the universe. Small changes in health can lead to a <em>negative</em> compounding that has enormous impacts on your lifetime fulfillment and experience points.</p>
<p class="follow">The good news from all this: If you take even small steps to improve your health now (improving even 1 percent and avoid<a id="p125"/>ing the negative compounding effects), you will have vastly increased your total experience points.</p>
<p class="follow">There’s a clear implication in this observation, and it’s one you’ve doubtless heard before: People of all ages should be spending more time and money on their health. No age group spends more on health than the elderly, whose healthcare spending aims to treat degenerative diseases, manage pain, and prolong life. But earlier investments in health would actually yield greater lifetime fulfillment. Preventive steps like eating right and strengthening muscles helps you keep your health as high as possible for as long as possible—and makes every experience more enjoyable. I’m not just talking about being able to ski into your seventies instead of having to settle for shuffleboard, or playing tennis instead of pickleball. No, even simple, everyday activities like walking up and down stairs, getting up out of a chair, or carrying bags of groceries become easier and more pleasant when you’re physically fit and not carrying around excess body weight on weak bones and muscles. Just think: How quickly you get tired on a day of sightseeing, snowboarding, or playing with little kids will have an obvious impact on how much enjoyment you get out of that day. Now multiply that out to all your future potential days of such experiences!</p>
<p class="follow">This is why I love making prop bets tied to health goals—the kind where I’ll bet a ridiculous amount of money that a buddy won’t manage to run a marathon or won’t be able to lose a certain amount of weight. I’ve made more of these kinds of bets than I can count, and I think they’re great, because the value of attaining a big, life-changing health goal far exceeds the money at stake. A recent favorite (despite the fact that I lost the bet) involved two young guys I know from the poker world, brothers Jaime and Matt Staples. At the start of the bet, Jaime was <a id="p126"/>obese, and had made no secret of his past attempts at weight loss—whereas Matt was a bit underweight, and he wanted to build muscle. To motivate them both to move toward their goals, I placed a single bet: The pair would get a large sum from me if, in exactly one year, they reached the same weight (technically, within one pound of each other).</p>
<p class="follow">Amazingly, their transformation was tremendous: Jaime’s weight went down by more than 100 pounds, while Matt gained more than 50, much of it muscle. You can see the before-and-after pictures on the Internet.<a id="px1762"/> Obviously, they were happy to win and were proud of their accomplishment—but even if they had lost the bet after getting close, the monetary loss (only one-fiftieth of my stake, since we’d set the odds at 50–1) would have been worth the benefits of improved health, especially given their young age. They will have many years to enjoy the heightened fulfillment they get from having attained these health goals. Better health doesn’t just give you a better retirement years from now—investing in your health is investing in every single subsequent experience!</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Don’t Undersell Your Time</h2>
<p class="left ">The other big opportunity I see for creating a more balanced life is to exchange money for free time—a tactic that usually has the most impact in one’s middle years, when you have more money than time. The classic example is laundry, a time-consuming weekly chore that most people dread doing and that, in many places, can be done inexpensively by an outside service that specializes in it.</p>
<p class="follow">Let me clarify. Suppose your work nets you $40 per hour, and <a id="p127"/>suppose laundry takes you two hours each week, because you’re slow and inefficient at this chore. A professional service that has better equipment and does laundry all day every day is much more efficient than you are and can turn a profit even while charging you $50 or less. Is it worth it to spend $50 per week on a service that picks up a week’s worth of your dirty laundry and delivers it clean and neatly folded the following week? Absolutely, because at $40 per hour, two hours of your time is worth $80. This is true even when you are not using that time to earn money; you can be using the time to take your kids to the park, or to read a book, or to meet a friend for lunch, or whatever you would enjoy more than doing the laundry.</p>
<p class="follow">Laundry is just one example; the same logic applies to any undesirable chore, like housecleaning. To me this kind of outsourcing always seemed like a no-brainer—so much so that I started doing it in my twenties, when I had a much lower income. Even then, I would choose to spend a Saturday morning rollerblading in Central Park and going to brunch at Sarabeth’s rather than cleaning my apartment. And thank the Lord that I chose to spend that money—because I now have lifelong memories of many pleasant weekends.</p>
<p class="follow">The more money you have, the more you should be using this tactic, because your time is a lot more scarce and finite than your cash. I am constantly trading money back into time. I’ll never get more than 24 hours in a day, but I can do my utmost to free up as much of that finite time as I possibly can.</p>
<p class="follow">This isn’t just my personal experience or economic theorizing. Research in psychology backs me up: People who spend money on time-saving purchases experience greater life satisfaction, regardless of their income.<a id="px1761"/> In other words, you don’t have to be rich to enjoy the benefits of spending money to free up time. <a id="p128"/>By running a field experiment in which they gave some working adults money to spend on a time-saving purchase (while giving another group of working adults the same amount of money to spend on a material purchase), researchers could begin to explain why people who spend money to save time are happier: Using time-saving services reduced time pressure, they found, and reduced time pressure improved the day’s mood. If done repeatedly, such daily mood lifts improve overall life satisfaction.</p>
<p class="follow">That makes sense to me, but I also think that something more than the relief of time pressure is at work. Here’s how I see it: If you pay to get out of doing tasks you don’t enjoy, you are simultaneously reducing the number of negative life experiences and increasing the number of positive life experiences (for which you now have more time). How can that <em>not</em> make you happier with your life?</p>
<p class="follow">You might realize with some regret that you got the balance wrong—for example, let’s say that you’re now 35 or 40, and in your twenties you spent all your time making money and therefore missed out on lots of great experiences. Although you’ll never get those years back, you can try to rebalance your life now. Therefore, you need to really focus on having more experiences now, while you still have a high degree of health, and spending more than a person your age who <em>didn’t</em> trade all that time for money. For every moment, there is an ideal experience to be having in that moment.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Your Personal Interest Rate</h2>
<p class="left ">You know how I’ve proposed that your ability to extract enjoyment from money declines with age? Well, the corollary to that <a id="p129"/>is that the older you are, the more someone should have to pay you to delay an experience. How much they should pay you is what I call your <em>personal interest rate</em>—which rises with your age. This idea immediately hits home for people in finance, who are used to thinking about interest rates and the time value of money. Let me explain.</p>
<p class="follow">Suppose you’re 20 years old; at this age, you can afford to wait a year or two to have an experience, because you can typically have the same experience later. Therefore, your personal interest is low—someone doesn’t have to pay you much for you to be willing to delay the experience. Let’s say you wanted to take a trip to Mexico this summer, but your boss said to you, “I could really use you here this summer. I know you wanted to take this Mexico trip, but would you consider taking it next summer instead? I would pay you <em>x</em> percent of the price of the trip to do that.” Okay, interesting offer. So how high would <em>x</em> have to be for you to agree? 10 percent? 25 percent?</p>
<p class="follow">Now suppose you’re 80. At this point, delaying an experience becomes much more costly, so your <em>x</em> would have to be much higher than when you were 20. Even if someone paid you 50 percent of the price of the trip to delay it, you should <em>not</em> necessarily take the offer—your personal interest rate at age 80 may be higher than 50 percent. It might even be higher than 100 percent.</p>
<p class="follow">What happens if you are terminally ill? Once you know that you won’t be around a year from now, your personal interest rate is off the charts—there is no amount of money someone can pay you to delay a valuable experience.</p>
<p class="follow">So your personal interest rate rises with age, but unfortunately we don’t always act as if it does. If this concept of a personal interest rate works for you, though, then keeping it in <a id="p130"/>mind when you are considering buying an experience can help you decide whether it’s worth it to spend the money now or to save it for another time.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Would You Rather?</h2>
<p class="left ">If the personal interest rate doesn’t do it for you, you can think in terms of simple multiples of an experience. This is how the famous marshmallow test, created for preschoolers by psychologist Walter Mischel at Stanford in the 1960s, is set up: Would you rather have one marshmallow now, or two marshmallows 15 minutes from now? Many three-year-olds might say they’d rather have two marshmallows in 15 minutes, but once that tempting marshmallow is in front of them, many can’t wait. Adults usually have a better ability to delay gratification—very often to the point where delaying gratification no longer serves them well. In effect, they are opting not for one marshmallow now or two marshmallows in 15 minutes, but for one and a half marshmallows ten years later!</p>
<p class="follow">When it’s presented in that way, the mistake seems obvious. So how do you apply this logic to your spending decisions? When you face a choice, such as whether to go on a trip on your next vacation or to save your money for later, ask yourself, <em>Would I rather have one trip now, or two such trips</em> x <em>years from now?</em> Here’s how to figure out what <em>x</em> is. Whenever you have some discretionary income—whether it’s $10 or $100 or $1,000 or more—you have a choice. You can spend the money now or you can save it for later. If you save it for later, there’s potential for the money to grow, because unless you’re putting it under your mattress, you’re investing it in something (like the stock market) that <a id="p131"/>promises a return above the rate of inflation. This inflation-adjusted interest rate is called the “real interest.”</p>
<p class="follow">The longer you let the investment grow, the more money you end up with—so after a number of years, your principal ($100, for example) could double (to $200) or even triple (to $300). The real interest rate varies, but let’s take the example of 8 percent annual growth. (That is a little more than the average stock market return<a id="px1760"/> since its inception—again, after adjusting for inflation.) At that rate, your $100 becomes $147 in five years. In ten years, it becomes $216—more than enough to buy two of whatever experience you thought about buying now.</p>
<p class="follow">The question is: Should you wait nine to ten years to get two of the experiences you could have today? It’s totally up to you, and your answer will depend a lot on the kind of experience it is—as it should. For you to even consider the choice of one now versus two or more later, the experience has to be one that can be replicated. (Once-in-a-lifetime events like weddings and graduations of family and best friends obviously can’t.) You should also think about whether the experience might actually be better if you delay it: Sometimes by waiting, you can use the extra money to buy a significantly better version of the same experience. I can tell you, for example, that experiencing Las Vegas at 40 is much better than Las Vegas at 20, assuming you have significantly more money at 40 than at 20. It’s like two different Las Vegases. I’m not saying that no 20-year-old should go to Las Vegas. My point is there are times to delay gratification, because doing so will net you more life experience points.</p>
<p class="follow">So it depends on the experience you’re trying to have. But in general, I think you’ll find that if you ask yourself, <em>Would I rather?</em> you will naturally choose to delay when you’re younger and to avoid delays when you are older. If you’re 20, your answer <a id="p132"/>will probably be that you’re willing to wait. Why? Because ten years on, you’ll probably still have much of your current health, and two trips are better than one. But if you’re 70, you probably don’t want to wait until you’re 80! Your declining health—which means that the experience might not be available to you if you delay having it—tells you to have the experience now.</p>
<p class="follow">So you see, thinking in terms of <em>Would I rather?</em> is really getting at the same issue as the personal interest rate: The older you get, the less willing you should be to delay an experience, even if someone pays you a lot of money to do so.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Solving for Maximum Fulfillment: Introducing the Die with Zero App</h2>
<p class="left ">Throughout this chapter I’ve been talking about balancing the spending and saving you do throughout your life. I’ve already explained in general terms that you should shift spending to more or less the right ages. And you understand the three factors that most affect your ability to enjoy your life energy: health, free time, and money. But if your goal is to <em>maximize</em> lifetime enjoyment, that means finding out how much to spend each year, a number that varies depending on each person’s circumstances.</p>
<p class="follow">To find that number, I needed a computer program that takes in each person’s individual circumstances and runs a bunch of calculations to determine the optimal spending plan for that person. I’m happy to say that, with help from an economist, I’ve developed this app. Now, using this app isn’t necessary for getting more out of your life energy; you’ll be able to do that just by following the advice throughout this book. But if you want to be even more optimal—if you want to squeeze out every available bit of <a id="p133"/>your life energy—the app can help. To find out more about the app and how it can help, please check out the appendix.</p>
