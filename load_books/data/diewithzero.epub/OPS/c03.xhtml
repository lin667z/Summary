<p class="left ">Staying on autopilot is easy; that’s why we use it. But if you’re trying to live a full and optimal life, rather than just taking the path of least resistance, autopilot won’t give you what you want. To fully enjoy life instead of just surviving it, you need to stop driving mindlessly and actively steer your life the way you want it to go. That won’t be the last time I say that—helping you live more deliberately is one of my biggest goals for this book. We need to keep revisiting that theme throughout these pages, because autopilot operates in several areas of your life, from how you earn money to how you give money to other people. Each type of autopilot can create its own form of wasted life energy, <a id="p40"/>and each requires a different strategy for eliminating the waste. This chapter focuses on the type of excess that comes from earning and saving more money than you’ll ever get to enjoy. It suggests a deliberate solution for removing that kind of waste.</p>
<p class="follow">To show you what I mean, let me tell you about John Arnold, someone I became friends with years before he became a billionaire. After he and I met, he started a hedge fund called Centaurus, with the goal of converting his energy-trading expertise into riches so he could enjoy the good life. But as I worked side by side with him at Centaurus, I could see that, somehow, the good life was constantly getting pushed aside in exchange for making more millions. During one soul-crushing day on the job, John turned to me and said, “Once I make $15 million, if I’m still trading, punch me in the face.”</p>
<p class="follow">Well, I didn’t punch him when he hit that target, and John continued to work as a trader. John is a brilliant guy. (People called him “the king of natural gas” for his unbeatable returns.) John understood perfectly well that at a certain point it makes a lot more sense to spend money doing the things you love than to simply earn more money—but his numerical target kept shifting. He didn’t quit when he’d amassed $15 million. He was trading so well that the $15 million became $25 million, which eventually became $100 million, and so on. When you’re on a winning streak that big, it’s hard to stop, even when your rational mind tells you that you should.</p>
<p class="follow">John’s life wasn’t all work—there were occasional trips to great events, but hardly anything spectacular, like you would imagine for a multimillionaire. In fact, as his wealth grew, his leisure time seemed to diminish. He seemed to think that if he made more money, he could then do more—but in truth, he wasn’t doing more.</p>
<a id="p41"/>
<p class="follow">Still, he kept running Centaurus, and he didn’t quit even when he’d reached a net worth of $150 million. In fact, by 2010, the charitable foundation he and his wife had set up had assets of $711 million. He had so much wealth that he was giving millions away. Yet he kept working, even though he didn’t exactly love his job. When he did finally quit, in 2012, at age 38, he had built a personal fortune of more than $4 billion.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, the vast majority of people can only dream of retiring by the relatively young age of 38—yet for John, that retirement age was actually a few years too late. Why? Two reasons. First, he’ll never get those years back that he spent just focusing on making money. He’ll never be 30 again, and his children will never again be babies. Second, he made so much money that he now faces the <em>Brewster’s Millions</em> problem: It’s actually hard to spend his fortune fast enough. He already lives in a magnificent house and these days does pretty much what he wants.</p>
<p class="follow">One reason he can’t use up his money is his kids: Much as he’d enjoy having the über-popular pop band Maroon 5 play private concerts in his backyard every Saturday, for example, he doesn’t do anything of the sort, because he doesn’t want to spoil his children. He decided to have children, and that decision limits how he can spend his money and his time. Bear in mind that every choice you make affects subsequent choices—and the choice to have children is the most common example of that.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, John would say that if he had quit at $15 million, he never would have gotten to $4 billion—an amount that enables him to make a much bigger impact on the social causes he cares about. That’s very true. But John would also be the first to admit that he worked past the point of the optimal utility of that money. Did he pass that point at $2 billion? $1.5 billion? Who <a id="p42"/>knows. But we definitely know that it was before he reached $4 billion.</p>
<p class="follow">You might also be thinking that John must have been having a wonderful time making all that money if he continued doing it for so long. Maybe he stayed at his trading desk because the thrill of trading was more exciting than anything he could have experienced at home.</p>
<p class="follow">But no, John wasn’t making a calculated choice between work and family, or between working for money and the millions of other things he could have been doing with his wealth, time, and talent. No, he was continuing to work because he had formed the habit of working, much like a smoker who had picked up cigarettes as a teenage boy because he wanted to look cool to the girls. But now that the boy got the girl, why is he still smoking? Only because he’s formed an addictive habit, and habits are hard to break. For some people, it can be the same with working for money—it is just easier to keep doing what you’ve been doing, especially when what you’ve been doing continues to reward you with society’s universal form of recognition for a job well done, aka money. Once you’re in the habit of working for money to live, the thrill of making money exceeds the thrill of <em>actually living.</em></p>
<p class="follow">John, of course, is an extreme case, and his situation is the epitome of a high-class problem. But the situation he finds himself in is <em>not</em> unique to him, or even just to the ultrarich more generally. So many people feel like they can never get enough, and as their net worth grows, their goalposts just keep shifting. But no matter who you are—a captain of industry or an everyday working stiff—one thing is true: If you spend hours and hours of your life acquiring money and then die without spending all of that money, then you’ve needlessly wasted too many <a id="p43"/>precious hours of your life. There is just no way to get those hours back. If you die with $1 million left, that’s $1 million of experiences you didn’t have. And if you die with $50,000 left, well, that’s $50,000 of experiences you didn’t have. No way is that optimal.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">A Waste of Life Energy: Why You Might Be Working for Free</h2>
<p class="left ">Or look at it another way: Consider all the hours of your life you waste earning money you never spend. Take Elizabeth, a (fictitious) 45-year-old single woman who earns $60,000 a year at her office job in Austin, Texas. This salary puts her in the top half of all 45-year-old income earners in the United States.<a id="px1743"/> (All the dollar amounts in this example are in real, inflation-adjusted dollars.) Like most of us, she has to pay income tax, including Social Security and Medicare tax, so her net income is approximately $48,911 per year.<a id="px1742"/> She’s a hard worker, averaging 50 hours a week, so her net income comes out to $19.56 per hour: That’s how much she takes home for every hour she spends at the office.</p>
<p class="follow">Thanks to her frugal lifestyle, she was able to pay off her student loans a few years after graduating from college and bought her house when she was in her early thirties, when housing prices in Austin were relatively low. By now, she’s paid off the mortgage, so she owns her house outright; if she sold it today, she would get $450,000 for it.</p>
<p class="follow">Last year, which was typical, she spent only $32,911 (thus saving exactly $16,000). Elizabeth hopes to retire in 20 years, so she’s been putting a good chunk of her paycheck away in a <a id="p44"/>401(k) and in the bank. She knows the 401(k) plan is an especially good deal, because it uses her pretax dollars, which makes her taxes lower than if she’d put all her money in regular savings accounts. Some employers match employee contributions to the 401(k) plan, but let’s say that Elizabeth’s does not.</p>
<p class="follow">Elizabeth is a reliable worker at a large company, so her job feels secure, and she expects to earn small but steady raises every year until she retires. To keep this example simple, though, let’s assume she maintains the same inflation-adjusted salary until she retires. Let’s also assume that, besides paying off her house, she didn’t start saving for retirement until she was 45. So when she does retire at 65, as planned, she will have saved $320,000 ($16,000 per year for the 20 years between 45 and 65). Therefore, her net worth at 65 will be $770,000—$320,000 in various retirement accounts and $450,000 in home equity (assuming her house doesn’t grow in value).</p>
<p class="follow">How long does that $770,000 last her? Well, it depends on how much she spends each year. Research on people’s actual retirement spending shows that spending isn’t constant, and often declines in later years (as I’ll explain shortly). But, again keeping our example simple, let’s assume Elizabeth spends exactly $32,000 each year of retirement, or just shy of $1,000 less than she did when she was working. (Again, for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that the return on her retirement investments exactly matches the annual rise in the cost of living.)</p>
<p class="follow">With that assumption, her savings will last a little more than 24 years ($770,000 divided by $32,000 per year). But Elizabeth doesn’t live another 24 years: She dies at 85, or 20 years after she left the workforce. As a result, she leaves behind $130,000.</p>
<p class="follow">I’m telling you this because I want you to really think about the true cost, the terrible waste, of leaving behind $130,000. I’ve <a id="p45"/>already said that you can think of this money as forgone experiences—whatever the $130,000 could have bought for Elizabeth. That’s sad in itself, but it’s not only that. By looking at what it took to save that much money—at Elizabeth’s hourly rate—you can see how many hours she spent in her office job that she did not need to spend. How many hours was that? Well, divide the $130,000 by $19.56 an hour and you get a little more than 6,646. That’s 6,646 hours that Elizabeth worked for money she never got to spend. That’s more than two and a half years of 50-hour workweeks! <em>Two and a half years of working for free.</em> What a waste of life energy.</p>
<p class="follow">The numbers would be even higher if we assumed that her savings earned interest above inflation, and that she would also have income from Social Security. But even under our very conservative assumptions, she would have been better off either retiring earlier or spending more of her money throughout her life.</p>
<p class="follow">You might be saying that Elizabeth is not typical. You’d be right, for example, to point out that some people net a much higher hourly rate during their careers. So for those higher earners, $30,000 does not represent as many hours (or years) of unnecessary labor. That is true. But here’s the thing: Those people end up dying with much more than $130,000. People who are earning a high hourly rate or a high annual salary are sometimes even more tempted to keep on working and earning. Either way, they are squandering their life energy.</p>
<p class="follow">Your own income might be higher or lower than the ones in any of these examples. It doesn’t matter, because the conclusion is still the same: If you don’t want to squander your life energy, you should aim to spend all your money before you die.</p>
<p class="follow">To me, this logic is incontrovertible. Maybe it’s because of my training as an engineer, or maybe it’s why I chose to study <a id="p46"/>engineering in the first place, but I love efficiency and I hate waste. And I can’t think of any worse form of waste than squandering your life energy. So to me it makes perfect sense to want to die with zero. <em>Not</em> to reach zero <em>before</em> you die, which would leave you high and dry, but to have as little as possible left unused for all the time and energy you spent working to earn that money.</p>
<p class="follow">I’m far from the first person to suggest that planning to die with zero is the rational way to live. Back in the 1950s, an economist named Franco Modigliani, who went on to win the Nobel Prize, posited something that came to be known as the Life-Cycle Hypothesis (LCH)—an idea about how people manage their spending and saving to try to get the most from their money <em>across their life span.</em> He basically said that making the most of your money in the course of your life requires that, as another economist put it, “wealth will decline to zero by the date of death.”<a id="px1741"/> In other words, if you know when you will die, you must die with zero—because if you don’t, you are not getting maximum enjoyment (utility) from your money. And what about the very real possibility that you don’t know when you’ll die? Modigliani has a simple answer to that: To be safe but still avoid needlessly leaving money behind, just think of the maximum age to which anyone can live. So a rational person, in Modigliani’s view, will spread their wealth across all the years up to the oldest age to which they might live.</p>
<p class="follow">Some people do try to live in this rational, utility-maximizing way, but many do not. Either they save too much or they save too little. Optimizing across your whole life takes a lot of thought and planning; it’s easier to live for short-term rewards (myopia) and to stay on autopilot (inertia) than to do what will be good for you in the long term. These tendencies can affect <a id="p47"/>both the grasshoppers and the ants among us. Myopia is often the problem of the fun-loving, free-spending grasshopper; inertia can strike the responsible ant as well—particularly later in life, when the dutiful saver must suddenly crack open the nest egg they’ve so diligently built up. Behavioral economists understand that just because something is rational to do—in this case, switching from saving to “dissaving”—that doesn’t mean people will do it easily. Inertia is a very powerful force. As economists Hersh Shefrin and Richard Thaler once put it, “It is hard to teach an old household new rules.”<a id="px1740"/></p>
<p class="follow">Dying with zero strikes me as such a clear and important goal that I want to go right to the next step: helping you figure out how to actually achieve that goal. But I’ve discussed these ideas with enough people to know that I can’t jump straight to the how: The same small set of questions and objections come up again and again, and I know I can’t ignore them. So I will first respond to these common “whatabouts”—and if you’re still with me about the value and feasibility of dying with zero, we’ll move on to some tools that can help you make that happen.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">“But I Love My Job!”</h2>
<p class="left ">When I say that leaving money behind amounts to a waste of life energy or to working for free, I sometimes hear from people who say that my analysis doesn’t apply to them because they love their jobs. Some people go so far as to say that they would <em>pay</em> to pursue the work they love—something I doubted until I began dating a professional dancer. (Not the stripper kind!) Dance is an extremely competitive field, with many more people auditioning than there are paying gigs to go around—and, unlike in act<a id="p48"/>ing or some other competitive fields, you can never get wealthy dancing, no matter how successful you become.</p>
<p class="follow">Nonetheless, just to stay in the game, you have to constantly take dance lessons to stay proficient and you have to live near one of the centers of the dance world, expensive cities like New York and Los Angeles. So most dancers have to take on other jobs that, in effect, subsidize their passion for dance. So, yes, I get that some people love their work and see it as a fulfilling life experience in its own right. And I think that’s wonderful—we should all be so lucky!</p>
<p class="follow">But, all that being said, I still think they would be better off dying with zero, and here’s why. First, let’s look at their side of the argument, which goes something like this: If your job itself is a fun, fulfilling experience, then any money you earn from doing the work is just a by-product—like the pile of ash left after a wood fire. When you lit the fire, creating ash wasn’t your goal; you enjoyed the fire’s warmth and flickering light, and you just happened to get some ash from the process, too. No harm there, and certainly no harm in making money from pursuing the work you love.</p>
<p class="follow">But here’s the thing: Even people who see work as a form of play would be better off if they spent at least some percentage of their time on experiences that <em>don’t</em> involve working for money. Even if dance is your life, chances are you won’t enjoy doing it 24/7. Also, when you’re in your forties, fifties, or sixties, you might want to spend a lower percentage of your week dancing than when you were in your twenties and thirties.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, it’s possible that you won’t want to cut back your hours as you get older—you might really want to keep dancing (or practicing law or psychotherapy or whatever profession you enjoy) full-time as long as you’re able, and earning money doing <a id="p49"/>it. Be my guest! Just be sure to spend the money that you earn on whatever you value: Take more first-class trips, throw better parties, go to see your favorite dancer perform live. Because even if you enjoyed every minute of the work that brought you that money, failing to spend that money is still a waste. To use a metaphor from video games, it’s as if you earned an extra life and then decided to throw that extra life away—you just let Mario jump off a bridge instead of taking the little guy further through the Mushroom Kingdom. Would you do that only because you weren’t counting on that extra life? Why take that easy-come, easy-go attitude? It’s the same with any money you receive. “Maximizing your life” <em>doesn’t care where the money came from.</em> Whether you earn it from a job you love or you inherit it from your great-granddad, whether the money is a by-product of following your passion or of being a member of the lucky-sperm club, once it’s given to you it becomes yours. And once it’s yours, it now represents hours of <em>your</em> life, which you can exchange for whatever will help you live the best life you can. If dance is your life, and you happen to also earn money from dancing, go ahead and spend it on dance-related experiences: Splurge on private lessons with the best dance teachers if that’s what you value, or hire someone to clean your place so you have more time to pursue dance. Just don’t let that money sit and go to waste because of where it came from. The source of your money doesn’t change the calculus on maximizing your life.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">“But . . . But . . .”</h2>
<p class="left ">When I say the words “die with zero,” most people’s immediate reaction is fear, quickly followed by the thought that dying with <a id="p50"/>money left isn’t a total waste, because that money will go to your heirs, or maybe to charity. The most common expression of this belief is “What about the kids?”</p>
<p class="follow">The kids question comes up so often, and there is so much to say about it, that it deserves its own chapter—and indeed it gets one, along with my thoughts on charitable giving. But for now, let me just touch on my answer to the kids question.</p>
<p class="follow">First of all, yes, you can certainly leave money to the people and causes you care about—but the truth is that those people and causes would be better off getting your wealth sooner rather than later. Why wait until after you die?</p>
<p class="follow">Second, whatever amount you give to others immediately becomes their money, not yours. But when I talk about dying with zero, I am talking about <em>your</em> money. Whatever you’ve given your kids will remain theirs, so there is no need to plan to have money left over for them. You’ll learn much more about how to deliberately plan what to leave, to whom, and when in a later chapter, “What About the Kids?”</p>
<p class="follow">Now let me address the fear. Many people have told me they’re scared—even terrified—that they’ll run out of money before they die. And I get it. Nobody wants to spend their last years in poverty, so it’s understandable that people save for the future. And I’m not saying you <em>shouldn’t</em> save for the future. What I’m saying is that people who save tend to save <em>too</em> much for <em>too</em> <em>late</em> in their lives. They are depriving themselves now just to care for a much, much older future self—a future self that may never live long enough to enjoy that money.<a id="px1739"/></p>
<a id="p51"/>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">People Who Save Too Much</h2>
<p class="left ">How do I know that people save too much for too late? I’ve seen the statistics. If you look at data on net worth by age, you find that most people keep accumulating wealth for decades, and most don’t start spending it down until very late in life.</p>
<p class="follow">The Federal Reserve Board tracks how much Americans have built up at various stages of their lives.<a id="px1738"/> For example, we know from its most recent Survey of Consumer Finances that the median net worth for U.S. households headed by someone aged 45 to 54 is $124,200. That just means that half of households in this age group have saved up at least $124,200, while half have saved up less than that—some of them have saved much more, and others have saved much less. What’s much more interesting than the median for this one age range is the overall trend. By look<a id="p52"/>ing at the net-worth numbers for other ages, you can see a clear pattern: The median net worth continues to rise as people get older.</p>

Americans’ median net worth keeps rising at least until their mid-seventies.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">It’s easy to guess why—people’s annual incomes tend to rise with age, and people continue to save what they don’t spend, so their nest egg keeps growing. And that’s great to a point, because there is a sweet spot in everyone’s lifetime during which they can most enjoy the fruits of their wealth. The problem is that people continue to save well past that optimal point. So American heads of household between the ages of 65 and 74 have a median net worth of $224,100, up from the $187,300 saved up by householders between 55 and 64. That’s crazy—people in their seventies are still saving for the future! In fact, even in their mid-seventies, people in this upper half of the population don’t start dipping into their savings. The median net worth for American householders aged 75 or older is the highest of all the age groups: $264,800. So even with rising life expectancies, millions of Americans are on track to have their hard-earned money outlive them. Yes, older people often save in anticipation of healthcare costs—but, as you’ll see shortly, people’s overall expenses decline with age, even counting the cost of healthcare.</p>
<p class="follow">Other data points in the same direction. A 2018 study from the Employee Benefit Research Institute<a id="px1737"/> used data on older Americans’ wealth (income and assets) and their spending to see how much people’s assets changed during their first 20 years of retirement. (“Or until death,” the study’s authors added, as if to remind readers that not everyone gets to enjoy a full 20 years of retirement.) In other words, were people spending down their assets, or were they largely preserving them? Here are some of their key findings:</p>
<a id="p53"/>
<ul>
<li><p class="follow">On the whole, people are very slow to spend down (“decumulate”) their assets.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">Across ages, whether looking at retirees in their sixties or those in their nineties, the median ratio of household spending to household income hovers around 1:1. This means that people’s spending continues to closely track their income—so as people’s incomes decline, their spending does, too. This is another way of seeing that retirees aren’t really drawing down all the money they’ve saved up.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">At the high end, retirees who had $500,000 or more right before retirement had spent down a median of only 11.8 percent of that money 20 years later or by the time they died. That’s more than 88 percent left over—which means that a person retiring at 65 with half a million dollars still has more than $440,000 left at age 85!</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">At the lower end, retirees with less than $200,000 saved up for retirement spent a higher percentage (as you might expect, since they had less to spend overall)—but even this group’s median members had spent down only one-quarter of their assets 18 years after retirement.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">One-third of all retirees actually <em>increased</em> their assets after retirement! Instead of slowly or quickly decumulating, they continued to accumulate wealth.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">Retirees on a pension—meaning that they had a guaranteed source of ongoing income after retirement—spent down much less of their assets (only 4 percent) during the first 18 years after retirement than did non-pensioners (who had spent down 34 percent).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="follow">So, clearly, people who, back in their working years, would have said they were saving up for retirement are not actually <a id="p54"/>spending those retirement savings once they reach retirement. They are definitely <em>not</em> on track to die with zero. Some of them appear to not even <em>aim</em> to die with zero; this is especially clear when you look at people with pensions. Pensioners could dip more deeply into their savings than anyone, since their guaranteed income for life assures them they will never starve. But, interestingly, pensioners spend down the lowest percentage of their wealth, probably because, as the data shows, that they had more wealth to begin with.</p>
<p class="follow">So the question remains: Why didn’t retirees spend more of their money when they were young enough to enjoy it more fully? What were they waiting for?!</p>
<p class="follow">There are a couple of answers to that question. The first is that people did have good intentions to spend the money, but once they reached a certain age, they found that their wants and needs changed, or perhaps diminished. Experts in retirement planning even have some lingo for this consumption pattern: go-go years, slow-go years, and no-go years.<a id="px1736"/> The idea is that when you’re first retired, you’re raring to have all those experiences you’ve been putting off until retirement, and you still (for the most part) have the health and energy to pursue those experiences. Those are your go-go years. Later on, typically in your seventies, you begin to slow down as you cross items off your bucket list and your health declines. And later still, in your eighties or beyond, you don’t have a whole lot of “go” left at all, no matter how much money you still have. As one retirement-planning adviser put it, “My dad is 86 and he doesn’t want to go anywhere, just stay close to home.”<a id="px1735"/></p>
<p class="follow">I saw something like this firsthand with my grandma when she was in her late seventies and I was in my late twenties. I was <a id="p55"/>just starting to make it as a trader and was excited to share my new wealth with the people I love, and my grandma was one of those people. So I gave her a $10,000 check. It feels like a dumb gift now, and if I knew then what I know now, I would have given her an actual memorable experience instead, such as a trip to visit relatives in another state. But back then, I was of the mind that people know best what to give themselves. I would have wanted someone to just give me the money, so that’s exactly what I did for my grandma.</p>
<p class="follow">My grandma was living with my mom in those days, so once in a while I’d ask my mom what Grandma had spent the money on. And it turned out that Grandma wasn’t spending it at all. It’s not that she was poor and needed it to pay the bills. She just didn’t have a lot of “go” left. When Christmas rolled around that year, Grandma presented me with a gift: a sweater. To this day, as far as I know, that sweater (which I would guess cost about $50) was the only thing that ever came of my $10,000 gift. There was no incremental joy she got from that transfer of $10,000, aside from whatever joy she got from getting me that sweater, or from knowing that her grandson wanted to give her money.</p>
<p class="follow">But for whatever reason, she just could not spend the money. She was just too thrifty for her own good—someone who actually kept every couch, love seat, and easy chair covered in plastic to protect the upholstery from wear and tear. Unfortunately, of course, the plastic also made the furniture uncomfortable and unattractive. One day I came into my grandmother’s house for somebody’s funeral and sat on a colorful, comfy couch—she had taken the plastic off for this special occasion. But the next time I visited, all the plastic was back on, and it stayed on for the rest of my grandmother’s life. This never made sense to me: Why spend <a id="p56"/>all this money on furniture that you don’t get to enjoy? The plastic over the couches is a microcosmic example of much of what I’m talking about in this book: the senselessness of indefinitely delayed gratification.</p>
<p class="follow">You might think that as people get older, they spend money more freely out of the sheer desire to make the most of it before it’s truly too late. But the opposite tends to happen. In general, spending among American households declines as people age. For example, the Consumer Expenditure Survey, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, found that in 2017, average annual spending for households headed by 55-to-64-year-olds was $65,000; average spending fell to $55,000 for those between 65 and 74; and spending fell again to $42,000 for those 75 and older.<a id="px1734"/> This overall decline occurred <em>despite</em> a rise in healthcare expenses, because most other expenses, such as clothing and entertainment, were much lower. The decline in spending over time was even more acute for retirees with more than $1 million in assets, according to separate research conducted by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which analyzed data from more than half a million of its customers.<a id="px1733"/></p>
<p class="follow">Many financial planners are very familiar with this pattern. On sites that provide retirement advice, references to the “slow-go” and “no-go” years abound. But the message of declining “go” doesn’t seem to have reached the general public. And if you’re not aware of this fairly predictable pattern, you’re likely to (incorrectly) expect steady expenditures on experiences from the day you retire until the day you die. That’s one reason you might greatly oversave and underspend.</p>

<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">An Abundance of Caution</h2>
<p class="left ">But there’s another, more intentional reason why people routinely save too much and spend too little, leaving money behind for when they die. Some people never actually planned to spend all that money on life experiences but instead were saving for the unforeseen expenses of old age, especially medical expenses. It’s not just that everyone’s health declines as they get on in years, creating higher medical expenses toward the end of their lives. It’s also that the actual expenses are hard to predict: Will you need triple bypass surgery or years’ worth of treatment for cancer? Will you have to spend years in a nursing home?</p>
<p class="follow">In theory, that’s what insurance is for: to protect against whatever calamity might strike. But even people with insurance sometimes find themselves with high medical bills. This can happen because of high deductibles or costly prescription co-pays, or just because the insurer for some reason denies coverage. Since most people want to stay alive after falling ill, it’s natural and reasonable to save up for medical care. And when the costs of care are uncertain, people tend to save even more.<a id="px1732"/></p>
<p class="follow">Yet even after taking the uncertainty of costs into account, many people <em>still</em> save too much.<a id="px1731"/> To me, that’s like going out and buying something silly, like alien robot invasion insurance. That is, assuming there’s some very, very tiny possibility that alien robots could invade our planet and wreak havoc on our lives, does that mean you should build a special shelter to protect yourself? I’d rather take my chances and use the money for something more useful and more enjoyable.</p>
<p class="follow">Planning for your medical care by saving money is a lot like <a id="p58"/>that, even though it is true that you’re much more likely to need costly medical care than to see heavily armed and ultra-intelligent extraterrestrials. To put it bluntly, no amount of savings available to most people will cover the costliest healthcare you might possibly need. For example, cancer treatments can easily cost half a million dollars a year.</p>
<p class="follow">Or, if your out-of-pocket medical expenses amount to $50,000 per <em>night</em> (as they did for my father’s hospital stay at the end of his life), does it really matter whether you’ve saved $10,000 or $50,000 or even $250,000? No, it doesn’t, because the extra $50,000 will buy you <em>one</em> extra night, a night that might well have taken you a year’s worth of work to earn! Similarly, $250,000 saved over however many years will get wiped out in five days. I’m not suggesting that you should rack up large hospital costs with a plan to then stiff the hospital on those bills. What I’m saying is that you can’t pay your way out of high-priced end-of-life medical care; since uninsured medical care is so expensive, it won’t make any real difference for the vast majority of us whether we save for it or not. Either the government will pay for it or you will die.</p>
<p class="follow">But let’s say you’re not part of the vast majority—let’s say you’re worth millions or tens of millions. What then? Even if I earn enough that I <em>could</em> save up for a few extra months of life in the hospital, I can’t see the logic in doing that: There’s a big difference between living a life and just being kept alive, and I’d much rather spend on the former. So I will not work for years to save up for a few more months on a ventilator with a quality of life that’s close to zero—or, depending on the level of suffering, maybe even negative. So instead of engaging in “precautionary saving,” as economists call the practice, I’ll let the cards fall where they may. We all die sooner or later, and I’d rather <a id="p59"/>die when the time is right than sacrifice my better years just to squeeze out a few more days at the tail end. Or, as I like to say, “See you at the grave!”</p>
<p class="follow">Besides, it is much smarter to spend your healthcare money on the front end (to maintain your health and try to prevent disease) than to spend it at the end, when you get a lot less bang for every buck you spend. In fact, many insurance companies not only cover preventive care such as mammograms but believe enough in the long-term cost savings of disease prevention that they actually pay you (in the form of gift cards, for example) to get regular screenings and other preventive care.<a id="px1730"/> You won’t be able to avert every possible illness, no matter what you do, but you can make some health problems a lot less likely—and you’ll enjoy better quality of life all along the way.</p>
<p class="follow">It might sound like I’m urging you to focus all your efforts on your youth and to not give a second thought to what happens when you’re old and frail. But that would be a misleading distortion of what I’m saying. Even though it’s a huge mistake to greatly sacrifice your quality of life now for better quality of life in old age, I do understand the desire to be taken care of when you’re old and vulnerable. So how do you make sure you’re covered if you need long-term care, without having to save up massive amounts of money you won’t spend if you don’t need nursing care? The answer: long-term care insurance. Look into it and you might discover that it costs less than you think, especially if you start paying premiums before you’re 65.<a id="px1729"/></p>
<p class="follow">There’s a more general point I want to get across: For every single thing you might be worried about in your future, there is an insurance product to protect you. That doesn’t mean I recommend buying insurance for every single thing; obviously, insurance costs money. But the fact that insurance companies are <a id="p60"/>willing to sell insurance for various risks shows that these risks can be quantified—and removed for those who don’t want to take those risks.</p>
<p class="follow">In this chapter, I’ve tried to show you <em>why</em> dying with zero is a worthy goal—a way to prevent one major waste of life energy. But what about the <em>how</em>? If you’re like most people, you’re still doubtful about the feasibility of actually hitting this goal, especially given the uncertainty about how long you will live. The <em>how</em> is the subject of the next chapter.</p>
<h3 class="sectionsubtitle">Recommendations</h3>
