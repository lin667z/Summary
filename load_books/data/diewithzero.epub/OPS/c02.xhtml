<h2 class="chaptersubtitle paired">Rule No. 2:</h2>
<h2 class="pairedtop notop sectionsubtitle">Start investing in experiences early.</h2>
<p class="left ">When I was in my early twenties, my roommate at the time, Jason Ruffo, decided to take about three months off from work to go on a backpacking trip to Europe. This is the same friend with whom I was splitting the rent on a pizza-oven-size apartment in Manhattan: We were both screen clerks making about $18,000 a year.</p>
<p class="follow">To make a trip like that a reality, Jason would have to put his job on hold—and he’d have to borrow about ten grand from the only person who would lend him that much money: a loan shark. You know, the kind of lender who doesn’t ask for col<a id="p20"/>lateral and doesn’t care about your credit report because he has other ways to make sure you pay up.</p>
<p class="follow">I said to Jason, “Are you crazy? Borrowing money from a loan shark? You’ll get your legs broken!” I wasn’t worried only about Jason’s physical safety. Going off to Europe meant that Jason would also miss out on opportunities for advancement in his job. To me, the idea of doing something like that was as foreign as going to the moon. No way was I going to go with him.</p>
<p class="follow">But Jason was determined, so off he flew to London, both nervous and excited about traveling alone with a Eurail pass and no set schedule. When he came back a few months later, there was no discernible difference between his income and mine—but the pictures and stories of his experiences showed that he was infinitely richer for having gone. You have to remember: This was the early 1990s, before high-speed Internet and Google Earth. To see what Prague looked like without actually going, you had to get a coffee-table photo book about the place. So hearing his stories and looking at his photos was like listening to some exotic explorer.</p>
<p class="follow">In Germany, he saw the horrors of Dachau. In the newly formed Czech Republic, he heard about life under Communist rule. In Paris, he and two friends he’d made whiled away an afternoon sitting in a park, just enjoying baguettes with cheese and wine and feeling like anything was possible. Eventually he made his way to the Greek islands. Somewhere along the way he fell in love with a woman and had sex on a beach for the first time. As he met locals and young travelers from all over, he learned more about himself and other people and cultures and felt his world opening up. His stories of the interesting cultures he’d seen and the connections he had made were so amazing, I felt pretty envious—and regretful that I hadn’t gone.</p>
<a id="p21"/>
<p class="follow">As time passed, that feeling of regret only grew. When I finally went to Europe, at age 30, it was too late: I was already a tad too old and too bougie to stay in youth hostels and hang out with a bunch of 24-year-olds. Plus, by the time I was 30, I had many more responsibilities than I’d had in my early twenties, which made it that much harder to take months off for travel. I finally, unfortunately, had to conclude that I should have just gone earlier.</p>
<p class="follow">Like me, Jason knows he timed that European trip exactly right. “I wouldn’t enjoy sleeping in a youth hostel with 20 guys on a shitty bunk bed now, and I wouldn’t enjoy carrying a 60-pound backpack around on trains and through the streets.”</p>
<p class="follow">But unlike me, he actually took the trip, so he doesn’t have to live with second thoughts. In fact, despite the high-interest loan, he has the opposite of regret about the expense. “Whatever I paid, I feel it was a bargain because of the life experiences I gained,” he tells me. “You can’t take those away, and I would never have them erased for any amount of money.” What he gained from that trip, in other words, is priceless.</p>
<p class="follow">Back when Jason first decided to take that trip, he was flying by the seat of his pants. He wasn’t planning out his whole life and consciously deciding to <em>invest in experiences</em> when he was young. In a way, he was lucky that his instincts led him to such a great decision. But more typically, instincts aren’t enough, and they often steer us the wrong way. My aim throughout this book, on the other hand, is to make you much more deliberate in your life choices—to use data and reason to figure out what to do. That’s how you’ll make the best decisions. And in this chapter, that means showing you how to think about your life experiences in a more quantitative way than you’re probably used to ever doing.</p>
<a id="p22"/>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">The Business of Your Life</h2>
<p class="left ">The main idea here is that your life is the sum of your experiences. This just means that everything you do in life—all the daily, weekly, monthly, annual, and once-in-a-lifetime experiences you have—adds up to who you are. When you look back on your life, the richness of those experiences will determine your judgment of how full a life you’ve led. So it stands to reason that you should put some serious thought and effort into planning the kinds of experiences that you want for yourself. Without that kind of deliberate planning, you’re bound to just follow our culture’s well-trodden, default path through life—to coast on autopilot. You’ll get to your destination (death) but probably without having the kind of journey you would have actively chosen for yourself.</p>
<p class="follow">Sadly, that is how too many people spend their lives. To switch metaphors: They build a well, they get a pump, and as the pump pumps water into a cup, the cup quickly fills, so the water starts overflowing. They take a sip and they keep pumping. And at the end of their lives, after a lifetime of pumping, they see that they’re still thirsty. What a waste! Imagine the regret you would feel if you got to the end of your days only to realize you haven’t managed to live a life full of satisfying experiences. In the wise words of Carson, the butler of <em>Downton Abbey,</em> “The business of life is the acquisition of memories. In the end that’s all there is.”</p>
<p class="follow">That sounds really nice, but it’s also the sort of thought that tends to go in one ear and out the other. You hear it, maybe nod approvingly, and then go back to business as usual. Toward the <a id="p23"/>end of my father’s life, though, this idea that life is about acquiring memories really hit home.</p>
<p class="follow">Dad could not have enjoyed any kind of vacation at that point—his physical ability was greatly diminished, and travel would have posed too great a risk to his life. Instead I gave him a shamelessly sentimental gift: an iPad full of memories. As a college student, he had played football for the University of Iowa, including 1959, the year the Hawkeyes won the Rose Bowl. So I took a highlight reel from that glorious season, had it digitized, and put it on the iPad. We’re always reliving parts of our lives through memories, and I figured that this format would make the memories more vivid and easily accessible to him. Sure enough, he loved it. As he sat holding the iPad and watching the video, he laughed, he cried, he reminisced. Too old to acquire significant new experiences, he could still derive great enjoyment from the highlight video. In fact, he thought it was the best gift ever. That was when I realized that you <em>retire on your memories.</em> When you’re too frail to do much of anything else, you can still look back on the life you’ve lived and experience immense pride, joy, and the bittersweet feeling of nostalgia.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Between the Ant and the Grasshopper</h2>
<p class="left ">The idea that you retire on your memories runs completely counter to most of what we normally hear about retirement. As workers in the United States, we’re constantly getting the message that we must save for retirement, that we need to regularly sock money away into a 401(k) plan or IRA. That’s just the <a id="p24"/>grown-up version of lessons we learned as kids about the need to save for a rainy day.</p>
<p class="follow">The best-remembered variant of the fable of the Ant and the Grasshopper, for example, has the ant sitting pretty (and pretty smug) after harvesting his grain, while the grasshopper goes hungry after spending his whole summer playing. That retelling leaves no doubt about which of the two insects had done the right thing, and it sure wasn’t the fun-loving, shortsighted grasshopper.</p>
<p class="follow">But don’t get me wrong: My point isn’t that we should be just like the grasshopper, failing to save for the winter of our life, or that any amount we spend on experiences is worth it because experiences are the stuff of life. That would be foolish. What I’m saying is that our culture tends to <em>overemphasize</em> the virtues of the ant—of hard work and delayed gratification—at the cost of other virtues. As a result, we fail to appreciate that the grasshopper was onto something, too. So, yes, the grasshopper would be better off to save a little—and, yes, the ant would be better off to live a little! I’m here to bridge the ant and the grasshopper, to help you find the right balance between the two. In fact, the stated moral of my favorite version of the fable is just this: “There is a time for work and a time for play.”<a id="px1728"/> In a later chapter, I will present actual tools to help you figure out the right time (and the right amount of time) for work and for play—for earning money and for spending it.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">What’s an Experience Worth?</h2>
<p class="left ">Earlier I said that life is the sum of all experiences. Well, I wasn’t just speaking figuratively: If you were to put a numerical value on each experience, you could then actually add up the value of <a id="p25"/>multiple experiences. Doing that makes it possible to compare bundles of disparate experiences, which is a step toward maximizing your lifetime fulfillment.</p>
<p class="follow">How do you place a numerical value on an experience? For starters, think about the enjoyment you get from each experience in terms of points, like the points you’d earn in a game. Peak experiences will bring you many <em>experience points</em>. Small pleasures will get only a few points. How many points you assign to an activity is totally up to you, because everybody’s values and interests are different. Some people like nothing more than tending their garden, so they would say that every day they spend gardening gets a high number of points. Other people would say you’d have to <em>pay</em> them to prune plants or pull weeds, so for them any time spent gardening would get zero points. (There are no negative points in this system.)</p>
<p class="follow">If you take all of your positive experiences from a given year—say, last year—and add up their point values, you get a number (for example, 5,090 points). You can represent this number as a bar on a bar chart. The higher the number, the higher the bar. It’s as simple as that.</p>
<p class="follow">You can do the same for every year of your life so far. Some years are better than others, for various reasons, and some of these reasons are out of your control. (If an accident left you confined to a hospital bed for 12 months, for example, you probably wouldn’t have many enjoyable experiences that year.) But this book focuses on managing what <em>is</em> under your control through the decisions you make—so realize that a few factors are in your control, and one of the biggest is how much time at each age you devote to earning money versus having enjoyable experiences. It’s just like the work-play trade-off faced by the ant and the grasshopper. As you take control of these decisions, you <a id="p26"/>change the heights of the bars and therefore the shape of your curve. We’ll talk more about how to make these trade-offs later—for now, I just want you to understand that I literally mean that life is the sum of your experiences.</p>

<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">The Memory Dividend</h2>
<p class="left ">This chapter tells you to invest in experiences—but are experiences really an investment? I mean, it’s easy to see that experiences take time and money, and that they can bring enjoyment during the days and years you are having those experiences, which makes them worthwhile for that reason alone. But let me tell you why I say that they’re also an investment in your future.</p>
<p class="follow">First, let’s talk about what an investment is. Most of us hear that word and right away think of the stock market. Or bonds. <a id="p27"/>Or a portfolio of different investments, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. What do all investments have in common? They are just mechanisms for generating future income. When you buy stock in, say, IBM, you are hoping that you will be able to sell the stock later for more than you bought it for or at least be able to earn dividends that IBM issues to shareholders, a teeny-tiny fraction of the company’s profits every year. Are you with me so far? The same with real estate: You buy a house that you think you can resell for a profit in a few years, and in the meantime you can rent it out and generate passive income every month, as long as your tenants pay the rent. If you own a business that makes widgets, and you buy a new machine that will crank out widgets twice as fast, with fewer defects, then the new machine is an investment in your business.</p>
<p class="follow">Standard, right? Now think about how to extend this idea, which we do all the time without necessarily thinking about it in terms of investment. For example, let’s say you’re a parent paying for your kid to go to college or graduate school. Why are you paying tens of thousands each year? Because you think it’s worth it. You probably believe your son or daughter will graduate with the kinds of skills and degree that will help them earn a much higher income than they would without the university education. But maybe you’re skeptical that their degree will ever pay off: Let’s say your son wants to study Himalayan basket weaving, and you hear that robots are getting so good at making baskets that all those lucrative basket-weaving jobs are disappearing. In that case, you will probably be a lot less eager to write the big checks to the university. When you’re thinking about these things, you are making investment decisions just as surely as if you were looking at rental properties or factory machines to buy. Economists even call expenditures on education “investment in human capital.”<a id="px1727"/></p>
<a id="p28"/>
<p class="follow">So you see that you can invest in yourself or in other people. You do this whenever you think the investment will pay off in the future. Now, here’s a more radical idea: The payoff from an investment does not have to be financial. When you teach your daughter to swim or to ride a bike, it’s not because you think she’ll get a better-paying job with those new skills. Experiences are like that: When you spend time or money on experiences, they are not only enjoyable in the moment—they pay an ongoing dividend, the memory dividend I mentioned in chapter 1.</p>
<p class="follow">Experiences yield dividends because we humans have memory. We don’t start every day with a blank brain, like characters in so many sci-fi movies. We wake up every morning preloaded with a bunch of memories that we can access at any time—mainly to get around and navigate the world. When you face a large rectangular panel with a protruding round knob, you don’t ask yourself, <em>What is this thing?</em> No, you know it’s a door. And you know how to open that door. So there’s a huge dividend from having once learned what a door is—think of all the doors you can open!</p>
<p class="follow">That’s a silly example, but it really shows what memories do for us. They are an investment in our future selves, paying dividends and helping us live richer lives. You see the person making coffee in your kitchen and you don’t start from scratch with them, as if you’re meeting a stranger. You know this is a person you love, and you know why you love this person. All the history that went into your relationship, all your past conversations and shared experiences, built the current feeling you have toward this person.</p>
<p class="follow">It’s the same thing when you’re investing in any experience. When you have an experience, you get that current, in-the-moment enjoyment, but you also form memories that you get to re<a id="p29"/>live later. This is a big part of being present as a living human being: For better or worse, you re-experience that experience, often more than once. You might hear a favorite song, get a whiff of a familiar scent, look at an old photo, and suddenly your memory’s triggered and you are reliving that experience. You think of your first kiss, and if that was a pleasant experience, then you might feel warm and fuzzy. Or you might chuckle because you had braces and the whole experience was embarrassing but also sweet. So every time you remember the original experience, you get an additional experience from mentally and emotionally reliving the original experience.</p>
<p class="follow">The recollection may bring you just a tiny fraction of the enjoyment that the original experience did, but those memories add up to make you who you are. That’s why Jason, whose story I opened this chapter with, wouldn’t erase his backpacking trip through Europe for anything. It’s also why people keep photo albums—and why, if their house is on fire, they usually grab their albums before trying to save just about any other possession. In that moment of crisis, people quickly realize that, whereas material objects can be replaced, memories are priceless.</p>
<p class="follow">The memory dividend is so powerful and valuable that tech companies are monetizing it and creating billions in wealth. Anyone who’s used Facebook or Google Photos has seen the occasional “On this day 3 years ago” message, with accompanying photos from that day. Through this feature, the companies tap into your memory dividend, sparking good feelings and a desire to reach out to those included in the photos. This whole process makes you happy—and makes you a more loyal customer. Before Facebook and the like, it used to be our friends and family who’d spark the “remember when” conversation—but now FB plays that role and cashes in financially on that all-important <a id="p30"/>memory dividend. You can cash in on the memory dividend yourself, non-financially—but to do that, you first need to create those valuable memories.</p>
<p class="follow">Think back to one of the best vacations you ever had, and let’s say it lasted a full week. Now think about how much time you spent showing pictures of that trip to your friends back home. Add to that all the times you and the people you traveled with reminisced about that trip, and all the times you’ve thought about it yourself or given advice to other people considering going on a similar trip. All those residual experiences from the original experience are the dividends I’m talking about—they’re your memory dividends, and they add up. In fact, some of these memories, upon repeat reflection, may actually bring more enjoyment than the original experience itself.</p>
<p class="follow">So buying an experience doesn’t just buy you the experience itself—it also buys you the sum of all the dividends that experience will bring for the rest of your life.</p>
<p class="follow">This becomes really clear when you think in terms of experience points—my way of quantifying how much enjoyment you got out of an experience. Remember how you can represent the number of experience points with a vertical bar? Okay, now think about that bar as just the beginning of the enjoyment you are getting from the experience. Because of the memory dividend, you also receive an additional little bar every time you recall the original experience. If you stack up all those little bars—all the ongoing memory dividends from an experience—you get a second bar that might be as tall as the bar that represents the original experience.</p>
<p class="follow">In fact, sometimes the second bar is even taller. One way this can happen is through compounding, just like with money in the bank. Due to compounding, your financial savings don’t just <a id="p31"/>add up—they begin to snowball. And the same thing can happen with your memory dividends—they also can and will compound. This happens whenever you share the memory of the experience with other people. That’s because whenever you interact with someone, sharing an experience you’ve had, that is an experience in itself. You’re communicating, laughing, bonding, giving advice, helping them, being vulnerable—you’re doing the stuff of everyday life. By having experiences, you not only live a more engaged and interesting life yourself, but you also have more of yourself to share with others. It’s like the idea that business begets more business. Positive experiences are radioactive and contagious in a good way; they start a chain reaction that releases more energy than you thought you had. One plus one can <a id="p32"/>be more than two. That’s one of the reasons I say that you should invest in experiences.</p>

<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">But most of us are not used to thinking about investing in experiences—so if we are investors at all, we focus too much on the financial payoff of an investment. A good example is my friend Paulie, who a while back asked me for advice about a vacation property he was considering buying in Central America. I won’t bore you with the financial gobbledygook—he was weighing things like interest rates and tax breaks and other considerations that made it all seem like a difficult investment decision. I will just say that he was looking at the opportunity from a very conservative and traditional point of view: <em>Is this a good real estate investment, meaning will I get a good financial return on it over the next 10 to 15 years?</em></p>
<p class="follow">My advice to my friend was to reject that whole framework. “Forget the money,” I told him, “and let’s just talk about what you’re going to get out of it. You’re my age,” I reminded him (no spring chicken). “So how much are you going to use this property to invest in your own personal experiences—how often do you plan to stay there, and what will you do when you’re there? If you’re going to go there many times and you’re going to have wonderful vacations and bond with your kids and have irreplaceable moments with your family and friends, well, that sounds like the greatest deal on planet Earth to me!”</p>
<p class="follow">I went on: “But if you’re just going to buy the property and have it sit there doing nothing but appreciating your capital investment, then who cares if you stand to gain an extra 3 percent on it? There is nothing special or life-changing about earning 3 percent on foreign real estate—it’s just one of a million types of investments you could make. That extra 3 percent is especially insignificant when you start at age 50, as compared with starting <a id="p33"/>much earlier. Investing in experiences, on the other hand, really could change your life, even at 50.”</p>
<p class="follow">My point to you is that, like so many people who invest in real estate, Paulie was thinking only about return on equity—not about return on experience. To me that’s just another version of the same mistake I’m always harping about: earning and earning while forgetting that your whole point in earning money is to be able to spend it on the experiences that make your life what it is.<a id="px1726"/></p>
<p class="follow">Think about it: Whether the experiences we want are learning, skiing, watching our children grow, traveling, enjoying great meals with friends, advancing a political cause, attending live concerts, or any of the trillions of combinations of experiences available to us, we acquire money with the goal of having experiences. Plus, because of the memory dividend, those experiences bring some rate of return, just as investments in financial instruments do—sometimes a ridiculously high rate of return. This is what Jason was talking about when he said that he would not trade his European experiences for any amount of money. Of course, most experiences won’t be as life-changing as Jason’s were, so they won’t bring as impressive a rate of return—and they don’t have to. We get a return on all our experiences. That’s why we spend money on them. It is also why we invest in financial instruments—to help our money grow, with the ultimate goal of generating more or better experiences.</p>
<p class="follow">Yet again—and I can’t say this enough—many people live as if they forget that this is the point of earning, saving, and investing money. When you ask people what they’re saving money for, much of the time the answer is “retirement.” To some extent, I get it: We all need to save and invest some amount of money for a time when we’re no longer getting a paycheck. Nobody wants <a id="p34"/>to starve in their old age or make their children have to support them. But here’s the thing: Since the whole point of money is to have experiences, investing money to get a return with which to have experiences is a roundabout way of having experiences. Why go through all that when you can just invest directly in experiences—and get a return on experiences? Not only that, but the number of actual experiences available to you diminishes as you age. Yes, you need money to survive in retirement, but the <em>main thing</em> you’ll be retiring on will be your memories—so make sure you invest enough in those.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Start Early, Start Early, Start Early</h2>
<p class="left ">Once you start thinking about the memory dividend, something becomes really clear: It pays to invest early. The earlier you start investing, the more time you have to reap your memory dividends. For example, if you start in your twenties (rather than your thirties), you’ll have a long tail of memory dividends—so you’ll be more likely to have the tail add up to more than the head (the number of experience points from the initial event). Clearly, the closer you are to death when you start having wonderful experiences, the fewer memory dividends you will have.</p>
<p class="follow">So when I say you should invest in experiences, my investment advice is pretty much standard. It’s kind of like what Warren Buffett says: Invest early, and by the time you get to a certain age, look at how much you’ve accumulated. Many investment advisers want you to start your 401(k) plan early. A lot of investment advice is like that: <em>Start early, start early, start early.</em> Warren Buffett and other investment advisers are trying to grow money, and I’m trying to grow the richest life I can; and when I say rich, <a id="p35"/>I mean rich in experiences, in adventures, in memories—rich in all the reasons you acquire money. So here’s my investment advice in a nutshell: Invest in your life’s experiences—and start early, start early, start early.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, you might be saying, how can you expect me to invest in experiences early in life when I’m broke? But investing in experiences doesn’t mean spending money you don’t have. It’s true that, in general, your enjoyment or fulfillment from your experiences is a function of both time and money—in general, the more time and money you spend on experiences, the more fulfillment you’ll get from them. But when you’re young, healthy, and unjaded, you can get a huge amount of enjoyment even from experiences that don’t cost a lot. (Remember my friend Jason, who had the experience of a lifetime while staying in cheap hostels and eating baguettes in the park.) So when you’re young and cash poor, my advice is to explore all the free or nearly free experiences you can have. Think of the free outdoor concerts and festivals that city and local governments put on with your tax dollars to make your town wonderful. Or consider how much fun you can have with your friends just talking, hanging out, or playing cards or board games. Or how much of your own town there is to see and explore on foot or by public transportation. Most of us aren’t taking anywhere near full advantage of these opportunities for free or virtually free enjoyment. I know I don’t—do you?</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Choose Your Own Adventure</h2>
<p class="left ">A lot of experiences are thrust upon you, especially when you’re growing up. You have to go to school, and in science class you’re <a id="p36"/>told you have to dissect a frog. You might say, “I don’t want to dissect this frog.” But then your teacher says, “If you don’t dissect this frog, you’re going to get an F in this course.” So you say, “Okay, I’ll dissect the frog.” You’re not given much of a choice there. But when you become an adult, you get to choose many of your experiences: You get to think about how you want to explore life and to decide for yourself where to invest your time and your money, and when to make these investments.</p>
<p class="follow">Unfortunately, most people greatly underutilize this freedom. We do make some conscious choices—to some extent, we choose our jobs, our hobbies, our relationships, our vacation destinations. But so much of our life is spent on autopilot—we move through the world as if someone else programmed our actions, and we don’t think nearly enough about how to spend our time and money.</p>
<p class="follow">This is really easy to see with the coffee habit—such a common example that it’s been given a name, “the latte factor.”<a id="px1725"/> So many people stop every day for a cup of gourmet coffee—and when they do, they barely realize that the cost of all those small indulgences adds up to a lot of money in the course of a year. I’m not here to tell you to skip your daily coffee so you can save up that money to “finish rich”—in fact, the last thing I want for you is to finish rich in money and poor in enjoyable experiences. But imagine all the experiences you could have for the thousands of dollars you are spending on your daily mocha, latte, or Frappuccino.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, when I bring this up, the response I usually get is “I like my daily Starbucks.” How can I argue with that? How they feel is how they feel. But what I can and do say is this: “At least be aware of what your Starbucks habit is costing you.” For example, you might say to yourself, <em>I can have a round-trip ticket</em> <a id="p37"/><em>to anywhere in the United States of America every few months based on what I’m spending on Starbucks. So would I rather have that round-trip ticket or would I rather keep up my coffee habit?</em> The answer is up to you, and you might choose the lattes, but if you’ve actively thought through the question and made a deliberate decision, then you’re not acting on autopilot.</p>
<p class="follow">Making deliberate choices about how to spend your money and your time is the essence of making the most of your life energy.</p>

<li><p class="follow">Remember that “early” is right now. Of those experiences you thought about earlier, think about which ones would be appropriate to invest in today, this month, or this year. If you’re resisting having them now, consider the risk of <em>not</em> having them now.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">Think about the people you’d like to have experiences with—and picture the memory dividends you stand to gain from having those experiences sooner rather than later.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">Think about how you can actively enhance your memory dividends. Would it help you to take more photos of your experiences? To plan reunions with people you’ve shared good times with in the past? Compile a video or a photo album?</p></li>
