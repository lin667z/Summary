<h2 class="chaptersubtitle paired">Rule No. 7:</h2>
<h2 class="pairedtop notop sectionsubtitle">Think of your life as distinct seasons.</h2>
<p class="left ">When my daughters were little, we loved watching <em>Pooh’s Heffalump Movie</em> together. I think it’s the most wonderful kids’ movie there is—a sweet, innocent story about friendship. We watched it many times. But then one day, when my younger daughter was ten, I suggested we watch the Heffalump movie and, to my astonishment, she just wasn’t interested anymore. All of a sudden, she thought she was too old for it!</p>
<p class="follow">If someone had told me that by this date my kid would stop wanting to watch the Heffalump movie, I probably would have watched it with her a lot more. Unfortunately, in real life you <a id="p136"/>rarely get an exact date for when you will no longer be able to do something—these things just seem to fade away. And until they’re gone, you don’t give their gradual demise much thought, if any. You just kind of assume that some things will last forever. But of course, they don’t. That’s sad, granted, but there’s good news: Just realizing that they don’t last forever, that everything eventually fades and dies, can make you appreciate everything more in the here and now.</p>
<p class="follow">This entire book is predicated on the hard, cold truth that we will all die and, as we age, our health will gradually decline. But there’s another, less obvious truth about “dying” that has important implications for how you should live your life: We all die a multitude of deaths throughout our lives. (I’ll explain that shortly.) This chapter explores the practical implications of this universal process, of passing from one stage in your life to the next. In addition, this chapter gives you a tool—known as time bucketing—for planning your life experiences accordingly.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">No Clear End Points</h2>
<p class="left ">My experience with the Heffalump movie is just one example. For several years, I was living the life of a dad who watches his favorite kids’ movie surrounded by his young children. But then one day that stage of my life and theirs was gone. I’m still here, of course, and I can still enjoy other experiences with my daughters—watching their soccer games and dance recitals, for example, and taking them on trips. But someday they will grow up and that version of me will disappear, too.</p>
<p class="follow">Likewise, but for reasons of my own inevitable aging, there will eventually be a last time I ever go wave-running, and a last <a id="p137"/>time I play in a poker tournament, and a last time I’ll be able to board a plane and fly somewhere exotic. Some of these final experiences will come sooner than others, but all will definitely come at some point in the (hopefully) far distant future.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, I’m not trying to be morbid, nor am I trying to present so much in the way of gloom and doom. My point—and this is important—is that the day I die and the day I stop being able to enjoy certain experiences are two distinctly different dates. And this is true for everyone.</p>
<p class="follow">That is what I mean when I say that we die many deaths in the course of our lives: The teenager in you dies, the college student in you dies, the single unattached you dies, the version of you that’s a parent of an infant dies, and so on. Once each of these mini-deaths occurs, there’s no going back. Maybe “dies” is a bit harsh, but you get the idea: We all keep moving forward, progressing from one stage or phase of our lives to the next. So much death and doom, I know—but the upside is that we have many lives to live and to enjoy and to maximize!</p>
<p class="follow">The challenge of maximizing these lives is not just that there’s no going back. Think back to your own past experiences. When was the very last time you went outside and played with your childhood friends? When was the very last time you talked to a beloved professor before he or she died? Even if you can recall the exact date, you probably didn’t know it in advance. Unlike school years and round-trip vacations, the end points of most periods in our lives come and go without much fanfare. The periods may overlap, but sooner or later each one comes to an end.</p>
<p class="follow">Because of this eventual finality of all of life’s passing phases, you can delay some experiences for only so long before the window of opportunity on these experiences shuts forever. The best analogy I can think of is a set of different swimming pools, the <a id="p138"/>kind some large resorts have—there’s usually a wading pool for little kids, a pool with a waterslide for older kids and teens, an adults-only pool, maybe even a pool for lap swimming and a pool just for seniors. Now, you can go in every pool for as long as you want, but only if you follow that pool’s precise rules.</p>
<p class="follow">So if you don’t learn to swim by the time you’re too old for the kiddie pool, you can still go to the teen pool, and later to the adult pool; but if you’re no longer a teen, no more waterslide for you! It doesn’t matter how strong a swimmer you are or how much you regret your fear of the waterslide when you were younger. Likewise, in real life, you can safely delay some experiences for a future period—if you don’t take certain trips or pursue certain physical activities in your twenties, you might still be able to take them in your thirties—but this ability to transfer physical experiences from one time period to another is limited. In fact, it’s actually more limited than most people seem to realize when they delay and delay. Some people act as if they will have access to the kiddie pool and the teen pool all their lives—or that their whole life is one big pool that they can use at any time. But then time passes and they find themselves in the senior pool and ask themselves how they wound up there!</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Regret-Free Living</h2>
<p class="left ">Do you see what I’m saying? The problem of confronting overly delayed gratification and the resulting regret doesn’t occur just once, at the end of one’s life. Rather, it can occur at <em>every</em> period during your life, from the bookworm teenager who missed out on all the fun of high school by making too many sacrifices for the sake of a supposedly brighter future to the middle<a id="p139"/>-aged dad who repeatedly skipped irreplaceable experiences with his own teens by constantly hustling for one job promotion after another. Sometimes people realize their mistake just before the window of opportunity closes—like when one’s children are getting ready to leave the nest—and sometimes the recognition comes when it’s too late to do anything at all about it except resolve to do better in their next life stage.</p>
<p class="follow">The saddest, though, is when the realization doesn’t hit until you’re facing your own mortality, when it really is too late to change anything and all you can do is make peace with your past.</p>
<p class="follow">For those of us who still have time to make changes and adjustments, it can be enlightening and even motivating to read or hear about other people’s deathbed regrets.</p>
<p class="follow">Many of these are particular to each individual, of course, but if you listen to dozens of stories about people’s deathbed regrets, common patterns do tend to emerge. An Australian woman named Bronnie Ware, whose work as a palliative caregiver put her at the bedsides of patients with just weeks left to live, talked with her patients about what they wished they had done differently in their lives, and found five key regrets coming up more often than any others. As she describes in a popular online article and in a subsequent book, the two most common regrets<a id="px1769"/> are ones that are most relevant to my message.</p>
<p class="follow">Her patients’ number one regret was wishing they’d had the courage to live a life true to themselves—as opposed to the life that others expected of them. It’s a regret about not pursuing your dreams, and therefore having those dreams go unfulfilled. If you ignore what you truly value in life and instead pursue a path that the rest of your surrounding everyday culture foists upon you, you risk having real regret at the end of your days. In <a id="p140"/>American culture, which so often values hard work and earning money to the exclusion of other important values (such as leisure, adventure, and relationships), it stands to reason that people often come to the end of their days really wishing they hadn’t made this kind of sacrifice. As the old saying goes, “No one ever regrets not having spent more time in the office.”</p>
<p class="follow">Along those lines, the second regret—and actually the top regret among Ware’s male patients—was this: “I wish I had not worked so hard.” That hits right at the heart of what I’m preaching. “All of the men I nursed deeply regretted spending so much of their lives on the treadmill of a work existence,” Ware writes. Women had this regret, too, but, as Ware points out, her patients were from an older generation, when fewer women worked outside the home. And when people say they regret working so hard, they are not talking about the hard work of raising children; they are talking about working to make a living to pay the bills and, as a result, missing “their children’s youth and their partner’s companionship.”</p>
<p class="follow">Now, let’s take a deep breath. I recognize that all this talk about death and regrets in life sounds very depressing. I realize that by attempting to raise awareness of what you will eventually lose forever, I am handing you a kind of anticipatory grief. But believe it or not, thinking about impending loss can actually make you happier. A most revealing experiment with college freshmen shows why.</p>
<p class="follow">A team of psychologists asked one group of young students to imagine that they would be moving far away in 30 days, and told them to plan their next 30 days accordingly: It would be the students’ last chance for a very long time to enjoy all the special people and places they’d come to like about their college. In short, the students were urged to savor their remaining time on <a id="p141"/>campus. Then, every week that month, the researchers asked the students to write down their activities.</p>
<p class="follow">By contrast, another group of freshmen weren’t told to imagine anything or to do any kind of savoring of their days—they merely had to track their daily activities. Guess what happened? As you can imagine, the students in the first group were happier by the end of the 30 days than the second group. Whether they did more or just managed to squeeze more enjoyment<a id="px1768"/> out of whatever they did on a daily basis, the mere act of deliberately thinking about their time as limited definitely helped.</p>
<p class="follow">What’s the takeaway here? Being aware that your time is limited can clearly motivate you to make the most of the time you do have.</p>
<p class="follow">We’ve all experienced some version of this effect when going on vacation in a new place. As tourists, we know all too well that we have only a week or however long at our destination—so we plan ahead to make sure we pack in as many landmarks, tours, activities, and other experiences unique to the place we’re visiting as we can. If we’re visiting friends, we make sure to spend plenty of time with those folks, and we try to savor every moment. In other words, we make a full and conscious effort to treat our time as the scarce resource that it is.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, that’s usually very different from what we do when we’re back home, where we’re much more likely to take our hometown’s everyday, routine attractions for granted. It’s not just that we’re busy with other pressing, daily responsibilities, even though it is true that we are and it would be unrealistic to live your life as if you were always on vacation. But it’s more than that—it’s also that most people just have the sense that there’s no time urgency near home; they act as if they will always be able to visit that museum or that nearby beach or that friend <a id="p142"/>some other time. As a result, we spend many of our evenings watching TV, and we fritter away our weekends. In short, when something feels abundant and endless, the truth is, we don’t always value it. But the reality, of course, is that the time you get to spend in each phase in your life is <em>not</em> that abundant, and it’s certainly not unlimited.</p>
<p class="follow">Unlike some other topics in this book, the idea of having a finite number of phases with a finite number of days in each has nothing to do with money. Yes, the specific experiences you can have in each time period <em>do</em> have to do with money, but the reality and implications of these finite periods do not. Every person says things like “I’ve always wanted to hike such-and-such trail” or “I’ve always wanted to take my kids to such-and-such place.” Experiences like that exist on every budget. Let me suggest a simple tool to raise awareness of these phases in your life, in order to help you plan the experiences you want to have during your lifetime, and therefore to help you avoid excessive delays.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Learn from Your “Time Buckets”</h2>
<p class="left "><em>Time buckets</em> are a simple tool for discovering what you want your life to look like in broad strokes. Here’s what I suggest you do. Draw a timeline of your life from now to the grave, then divide it into intervals of five or ten years. Each of those intervals—say, from age 30 to 40, or from 70 to 75—is a time bucket, which is just a random grouping of years.</p>
<p class="follow">Then think about what key experiences—activities or events—you definitely want to have during your lifetime. We all have dreams in life, but I have found that it’s extremely helpful to actually <em>write them all down in a list.</em> It doesn’t have to be a com<a id="p143"/>plete list; in fact, you can’t know right now everything you’ll ever want to do, because, as you know, new experiences and new people you meet tend to reveal unexpected additional interests that you’ll want to pursue. Life is all about discovery. And you will revisit this list later in life, too.</p>
<p class="follow">But I’m sure you already have some ideas about which experiences you’d want to have at some point, some perhaps more than once. For example, you might want to have a child, run the Boston Marathon, hike the Himalayas, build a house, file a patent, start a business, volunteer for Doctors Without Borders, dine at a Michelin-star restaurant, attend the Sundance Film Festival, go skiing 50 times, go to the opera, take a cruise to Alaska, read 20 classic novels, attend the Super Bowl, compete in a Scrabble tournament, visit Yellowstone, see autumn in Vermont, take your kids to Disneyland three times, and so on. You get the idea. Be as creative as you want.</p>
<p class="follow">Your list will be your own unique expression of who you are, because your life experiences are what make you who you are. Key point: As you’re making your list, don’t worry about money; money at this point is just a distraction from the overall goal, which is to envision what you <em>want</em> your life to be like.</p>
<p class="follow">Then, once you have your list of items, start to drop each of your hoped-for pursuits into the specific buckets, based on when you’d ideally have each experience. For example, if you want to go skiing 50 times in your life, during which decades or five-year buckets would you like to have those ski days? Here, too, don’t think about money just yet—rather, think about the point in your life when you’d really like to have each experience.</p>
<p class="follow">Some of these bucketing decisions will be easier than others. In fact, you probably already have a decent idea of some of the wonderful experiences you’d like to enjoy in your lifetime. <a id="p144"/>As for your other “wish list” items, well, for example, you can always travel to a faraway place. But as we’ve noted, it’s always easier to travel when you’re in your forties or fifties than when you’re in your seventies or eighties. The point is, today’s the day to start actively and consciously thinking and planning for your years ahead.</p>

<p class="follow">In general, using the time-buckets approach will make you begin to realize that some experiences are better done at certain ages. Mountain climbing and attending loud concerts, for example, are much more fun when you’re younger. Not surprisingly, the most physically demanding activities tend to fall on the left (younger) side of the timeline. You probably won’t be skiing much at 80. Yes, some people run the Boston Marathon in their seventies, and one exceptionally fit woman named Katherine Beiers completed the race when she was 85. But these individuals, of course, are outliers. And even for Beiers, the marathon at 85 was not her first—but her 14th.</p>
<a id="p145"/>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">A Season for Everything: Time Buckets vs. a Bucket List</h2>
<p class="left ">As you go through this bucket exercise, you’ll come to see for yourself that there’s a season for everything. That being said, you might begin to sense that some desired experiences conflict with other experiences. Or you might realize that some of the activities you want to do won’t happen at all unless you begin to plan for them now.</p>
<p class="follow">And just to clarify: This list is the opposite of the so-called bucket list, which is typically a single accounting of all the things you hope to do before you “kick the bucket,” so to speak. The more traditional bucket list is usually put together by an older individual who, when confronted with their mortality, begins to scratch out a list of activities and pursuits they not only haven’t done yet but now feel compelled to do quickly, before time runs out.</p>
<p class="follow">By contrast, by dividing goals into time buckets, you are taking a much more proactive approach to your life. In effect, you’re looking ahead over several coming decades of your life and trying to plan out all the various activities, events, and experiences you’d like to have. Time buckets are proactive and let you plan your life; a bucket list, on the other hand, is a much more reactive effort in a sudden race against time.</p>
<p class="follow">Now, you might notice as you fill up your time buckets that some experiences are more flexible than others. For example, you can still enjoy visiting libraries, watching classic movies, reading novels, and playing chess well into your old age. Taking a cruise can be enjoyable at just about any age.</p>
<a id="p146"/>
<p class="follow">Still, as you start filling up your time buckets, you’ll probably see that the experiences you want to have in life don’t fall evenly across the ages. Instead, they naturally cluster during certain periods—taking on roughly the shape of the right side of a bell curve (see figure below).</p>
<p class="follow">As long as you’re still ignoring the money factor, and still focusing primarily on your health and your free time, that bell will probably skew to the left—because you’ll want to have most of your experiences (especially those with physically demanding activities) when you’re at peak health to enjoy them, and before you’re constrained by the demands of parenthood. If your life plan includes children, the experiences you want to have with them will cluster a little later, probably creating a peak around your thirties and forties. Again, all that’s true even if you don’t take the cost of experiences into consideration.</p>

Without the constraint of money, most of your experiences would optimally occur in your twenties and thirties, when your health is highest. But in reality, most people's spending is clustered around midlife instead.

<p class="follow">Okay. Remember, we’ve been focusing only on two key com<a id="p147"/>ponents of your time buckets: your physical health and your life’s dreams. We deliberately pushed financial concerns off to the side, because it’s always too easy to blow off our dreams by simply saying, “Sounds really nice, but let’s face it . . . I can’t afford that.” Focusing on money distracts from the hard truth that time and health are fleeting.</p>
<p class="follow">But financial concerns are real, so read on to the next chapter, where we’ll talk about how to make sure you don’t miss the opportunity to spend your money while you still have time on your side.</p>
<h3 class="sectionsubtitle">Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="follow">If time-bucketing your whole life feels a bit overwhelming, just do the exercise with three time buckets covering the next 30 years. Know you can always add more to your list; just do it long before your age and health become a real factor.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">If you have children, think about your own version of the Heffalump movie<em>:</em> What one experience do you want to have more of with them in the next year or two, before that phase of their life and your life is over?</p></li>
