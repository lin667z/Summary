<p class="afterhang">The fact that all living organisms need energy to stay alive is just Biology 101—but its significance didn’t hit me until I read Thomas Gold’s <em>The Deep Hot Biosphere</em> (an important book for an energy trader, because Gold argues that the earth holds far more oil than the fossil-fuel theory of oil’s <a id="p206"/>origin suggests, whereas oil prices are predicated on a scarce supply of oil). Most fascinating to me, though, were the parts of the book about the origins of life from the simplest microbes to the most complex creatures, each relying on the chemical energy stored lower down the food chain. I latched onto the idea that I’m an energy-processing unit (EPU) every bit as much as a robot or a car is. That got me thinking about how calorically expensive it is to move our bodies, and how interesting it is that we build machines like planes that can move us great distances at high speeds—we are essentially EPUs that can build other EPUs. If you’re looking for an intelligent, self-improving, replicating machine, it’s here already, and it’s called the human race.</p>

<p class="afterhang">Psychological research supports the idea that your experiences are closely tied to your sense of self, which helps explain why spending on experiences brings more happiness than spending on possessions. For example, when participants were able to conceive of something (like a TV) as either a possession or an experience, being experimentally prompted to think of it as an experience caused them to see the purchase as having greater overlap with themselves than thinking of it as a possession did.</p>
