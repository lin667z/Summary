<h2 class="pairedtop notop sectionsubtitle">Know when to stop growing your wealth.</h2>
<p class="left ">I recently celebrated my 50th birthday. I certainly had a wonderful time on that day, but it actually wasn’t the biggest party of my life. My biggest, best party happened five years earlier, after I had set out to plan the most memorable 45th birthday celebration I could afford. The idea was to bring together all of my family and friends from every stage of my life and to introduce them all to one of my favorite places on the planet: the serene and beautiful Caribbean island of St. Barts, where my wife and I had spent our honeymoon.</p>
<p class="follow">Even though turning 45 is just a semi-milestone, I knew I <a id="p150"/>didn’t want to wait until I turned 50 to have this experience: My mom was already old, and I wanted her to be able to fly in and to fully enjoy the celebration. (My dad was already debilitated and couldn’t travel, so it was even more important that my mom attend.) Plus my friends weren’t getting any younger, either! Who knew if there’d ever be another chance to bring all of these people together? That year was the right time bucket, and I was determined to make the party happen. I wanted to have this significant and unique memory for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, this was going to cost some money. Fortunately, by this point in my life, through a bit of skill and a tremendous amount of luck in my work as an energy trader, I was doing well financially. But I know money is a concern for everyone, and many of the people I wanted to invite, including friends from childhood and college, couldn’t afford to fly to St. Barts and pay for a room in the secluded hotel I had my eye on. The people you share experiences with truly affect the quality of the experience—and nowhere is that more true than at a once-in-a-lifetime event. So I knew that if I wanted to have this kind of unique birthday bash, I was going to have to step up and pay for a lot of my guests to attend.</p>
<p class="follow">Still, my wealth is finite, just like everybody else’s, and as I started running the numbers, I ran up against my limits. Having this dream celebration would cost a big portion of my liquid net worth. Was it really a good idea to spend that much money on just one week, no matter how amazing that week might turn out to be?</p>
<p class="follow">We all face some version of this question whenever we consider a major purchase. Of course, the dollar amounts differ from person to person, often by orders of magnitude, but the core question is the same for all of us: What’s the best way to <a id="p151"/>spend our money for maximum enjoyment and in order to generate maximum memories?</p>
<p class="follow">Now, you already know some of my answers to this question: Invest in experiences that yield long-lasting memories, always bear in mind that everyone’s health declines with age, give your money to your children before you die instead of saving for their inheritance, and learn to balance current enjoyment with later gratification. But even though I’m a big believer in these principles, my 45th birthday party gave me pause: I had to talk myself over the psychological hurdle of spending a fortune on a single, weeklong party, no matter how memorable it would be. I had to tell myself again and again that I was never going to turn 45 again and asked myself when—short of my funeral, someday way in the future—I was ever going to be able to get all these key people in my life together again. Once I got over that psychological hurdle, though, I was all in, and I went all out, creating the best party my money could buy.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">The Party of a Lifetime</h2>
<p class="left ">I rented out the secluded beachfront Hotel Taïwana, on the white sandy beach of the island’s largest bay—all 22 rooms and suites. To house everyone, I also booked several rooms at the equally stunning hotel next door, the Cheval Blanc. I bought flights for dozens of guests. On top of all that, I arranged for boat trips and picnics and nightly food and entertainment: One evening was sushi-and-karaoke night, another was a night of old-school R&amp;B.</p>
<p class="follow">Then there was Natalie Merchant. When I was living in New York in my twenties, just starting out and sharing a tiny apart<a id="p152"/>ment with a roommate, he and I used to listen to <em>Tigerlily,</em> Merchant’s 1995 debut solo album. I loved that album. And I knew that the former 10,000 Maniacs singer’s mellow lyrical style would set the perfect mood for one special evening and that it would be a hit with everyone from my mom to the guys I’d grown up with in Jersey City. So I arranged through Merchant’s reps to bring her down to the island for a private concert, telling my guests only that we’d have a surprise guest.</p>
<p class="follow">The night of the private concert was as wonderful as you can imagine. I remember holding my wife from behind and just listening to the music and to Merchant telling the story of how she had composed one of the songs, and I also remember drinking champagne like crazy. It was a pleasure seeing my mom chatting with the great singer, too. But it wasn’t just that concert that was incredible—I would never change anything about that trip.</p>
<p class="follow">Picture it: You’re walking down from your room to the beautiful beach on a crystal-clear day, with gentle waves rolling in, and wherever you look, all you see are your loved ones. You see your best friend from college, and then you walk some more and you glimpse your best friend from your working years. Your mom is coming out of her cabana. You see other close friends on their deck or by the pool, and everyone is in awe of the beauty all around. And everyone is happy! Trust me, sharing that common experience is just the best feeling ever. At some point I actually had the thought <em>This might just be what heaven looks like.</em> That feeling came to me again and again. The whole week was awesome in every way and I’ll never forget it, not until my brain stops working.</p>
<p class="follow">To this day, the people in my life are still talking about that week, and every so often some little thing happens that reminds me of that wonderful party—and all those glorious feelings <a id="p153"/>come rushing back again. Reliving those days and nights in my mind feels almost as good as actually being there. At the end of my life, I am convinced, my joy will come from my memories—and that trip to St. Barts will be right near the top of the list.</p>
<p class="follow">That’s why I have absolutely no regrets about the insane amount of money I spent on that one week—nor the fact that I didn’t wait until my 50th birthday to have the party of a lifetime. In fact, by the time my 50th rolled around, my dad had died, and my mom’s health had, unfortunately, declined substantially. My brother and two sisters were there, but some of my friends couldn’t make it this time. From my perspective, it had been a very good decision to splurge on that extraordinary gathering five years earlier.</p>
<p class="follow">Or . . . I could have not splurged on that lavish party when I was 45. Instead I could have celebrated my birthday by just looking at my monthly investment savings and IRA statements. But what kind of memory would that be?</p>
<p class="follow">Look, many of us are inclined to delay gratification and save for the future. And the <em>ability</em> to delay gratification serves us well. Being able to get to work on time, paying everyday bills, taking care of our kids, putting food on the table—these are the essentials in life. But actually delaying gratification is helpful only to a point. If you have your nose to the grindstone too much every day, you run the risk of waking up one morning and realizing that you may have delayed <em>too</em> much. And, at the extreme, indefinitely delayed gratification means <em>no</em> gratification. So at what point is it better not to delay?</p>
<p class="follow">Well, there are a couple of ways to answer that question. One is <em>year to year,</em> as chapter 6, “Balance Your Life,” showed: Throughout your life you have to balance your spending on the present with your saving for the future. The optimal bal<a id="p154"/>ance shifts from year to year because your health and income are likely to change each year.</p>
<p class="follow">The other way to answer the question of optimal balance is by looking at your lifetime savings as a whole, and how to do that is the focus of this chapter. Now, this is not how most people think about spending and saving, so let me explain what I mean.</p>
<p class="follow">First of all, think about everything you own right now, from your house to your baseball card collection, from the value of your investments in the stock market to the cash in your wallet. These are your total assets. If you have any debt, such as student loans, a mortgage, or car loans, then total up all those loans and subtract that amount from your total assets. What you’re left with is your <em>net worth</em>: what you <em>own</em> minus what you <em>owe.</em> Sounds familiar, right? Net worth is a basic concept, and it’s one we touched on earlier when we looked at data showing that Americans’ median net worth tends to rise with age. If you understood that discussion, you already understand the next important point, which is that a person’s net worth isn’t the same throughout their life.</p>
<p class="follow">That’s a key point to understanding the peak: your net worth tends to change over your lifetime. That’s just how it is for most people. For a good chunk of your life, especially when you are starting out, you are simply spending the money that you are currently earning. At that early stage of your life, you are not increasing your net worth: If you’re living in a rented apartment, carrying a lot of student loan debt, and not yet earning enough to pay off that debt, you have a negative net worth, because you owe more than you own.</p>
<p class="follow">But as you chip away at those student loans—and assuming your income rises faster than your spending—you typically start <a id="p155"/>to save money, which means your net worth can start to grow from negative to positive. And it becomes more and more positive over time: If you stay gainfully employed, your net worth generally keeps rising, regardless of whether the rise is slow or fast. I’m not saying that’s how it <em>should</em> be—that’s just how it usually is. Let’s say your net worth at age 25 is $2,000, and then your net worth at age 30 is $10,000. By age 35 it will most likely be some number higher than $10,000—and it will typically be higher than that at 40, and higher still at 45. The statistics on household net worth (by age of head of household) bear out this trend.</p>
<p class="follow">Or look at the rates of homeownership,<a id="px1781"/> since owning your own home is a common way to build wealth. (You might not think of your home in the same way as you do about money in the bank, but there’s no denying that owning a house adds to your net worth.) Whereas only about 35 percent of Americans under 35 own their own place, the homeownership rate for Americans aged 35–44 is nearly 60 percent, and it is nearly 70 percent for Americans in the 45–54 age bracket. It’s even higher as people get older.</p>
<p class="follow">But these basic statistics describe only what people are currently doing about their net worth, not what they <em>should</em> be doing if their goal is to maximize their lifetime enjoyment. So what <em>should</em> you be doing?</p>
<p class="follow">This is where my advice diverges from what most people do: You should find that one special point in your life when your net worth is <em>the highest it will ever be.</em> I call that point your net worth peak, or just “your peak.”</p>
<p class="follow">Why should there ever be a peak—why can’t your net worth just keep going up? First, remember that, from my perspective, your overarching goal is to maximize your lifetime fulfillment—to convert your life energy to as many experience points as you <a id="p156"/>can. Doing that requires figuring out the optimal allocation of your money and free time to the right ages, given the inevitability of declining health and eventual death. As a result, some years you need to save very little money (so that you can spend more on your meaningful life experiences), while other years you should save more money (so that you will have more money to enjoy more, or better, experiences later).</p>
<p class="follow">But there’s an even more important reason for a net worth peak: your goal is to die with zero. If your net worth keeps climbing, rising from your sixties to your seventies and beyond, then there is no way you will die with zero. So, at some point you must actually start dipping into your lifetime savings; if you don’t, you will end up with unspent money, which means you haven’t acquired as many experience points as you could have. That is why I say your net worth reaches a level at which it is the highest it should ever be—after which you must start spending it down on experiences while you can still extract a lot of enjoyment from those experiences. That point, in effect, is your peak.</p>
<p class="follow">You can’t leave the timing of the peak to chance—to get the most out of your money and your life, you must <em>deliberately</em> determine the date of your peak. Later in this chapter I will give you some guidance on how to know and pinpoint that date.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">But Will You Have Enough to Live On?</h2>
<p class="left ">Before you start thinking about spending down your money, you must make sure you have enough to live on for the rest of your life. That’s an important caveat, because plenty of people aren’t saving enough for retirement. Although I want to urge ev<a id="p157"/>eryone to maximize their experiences, I don’t want to encourage irresponsible spending. Thinking of your peak as a date—and not as a number—is good advice only for people who have reached a certain savings threshold.</p>
<p class="follow">Even then, bear in mind that I am basing these recommendations on my own modeling of what makes for a fulfilling life; I am not a financial adviser, and if I inspire you to think differently about how to manage your money, it’s a good idea for you to first work out the details of your personal situation with a professional, such as a certified financial planner or accountant.</p>
<p class="follow">With that disclaimer in place, let me explain how I approach and think about the savings threshold. The threshold I’m talking about—how much you need to save at a bare minimum—<em>is</em> a number. But as you’ll see in a moment, that number may well be lower than what dutiful savers are already on track to save. That’s because the threshold is based on avoiding the worst-case scenario (that is, running out of money before you die); it’s the amount of money you need to have saved up <em>just to</em> <em>survive</em> without any other income. Once you meet this threshold, you don’t need to work for money—and you can start carefully dipping into your savings.</p>
<p class="follow">So what is that threshold? Well, it’s not the same number for everybody, because the cost of living varies based upon where you live, among other factors. And if you’re supporting people other than yourself, you obviously will need more savings than if you are a family of one. But for everybody, the survival threshold is based on both your annual cost of living and the number of years you expect to live from the present day.</p>
<p class="follow">Let’s look at an example. Let’s assume your annual cost of survival is $12,000. That’s admittedly really low. But I am using <a id="p158"/>this example not to tell you specifically how much you will need but just to give you a feel for how the basic calculation works.</p>
<p class="follow">Let’s also assume for this example that you are 55 years old and that, having looked at a life expectancy calculator, you expect to live until you’re 80. So your money will have to last you another 25 years (that is, <em>years left to live</em> = 25). How much do you need in your nest egg <em>today</em> to have a survival amount for the rest of your life?</p>
<p class="follow">Well, to get a very rough answer—not the final answer—you would just multiply your annual cost of survival, the <em>cost to live one year,</em> by the number of years you’ll be spending that amount, <em>years left to live</em>:</p>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<blockquote class="extract1"><p class="left ">(cost to live one year) × (years left to live) = $12,000 × 25 = $300,000</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">Again, this is <em>not</em> the final answer. The real amount you need to save up is actually much lower than $300,000. Why? Because your nest egg doesn’t just sit there while you dip into it year after year. Assuming you’ve invested it in a typical stock/bond portfolio, your money is usually earning interest, working to bring in income even when you are no longer working. Therefore, whatever interest it’s earning above inflation (whether that interest is 2 percent or 5 percent or whatever) is helping to offset the cost of your withdrawals.</p>
<p class="follow">Time for another disclaimer: Always bear in mind that even a stock/bond portfolio does not always earn interest above inflation. Rates of return can vary from year to year, sometimes by quite a bit.</p>
<p class="follow">For the sake of this example, though, let’s assume an interest rate of 3 percent above inflation. And let’s extend the example to take that 3-percent-above-inflation interest into account.</p>
<a id="p159"/>
<p class="follow">Suppose you start with $212,000 in savings and you spend $12,000 your first year. How much do you end up with after the first year? Well, you <em>don’t</em> end up with just $200,000. Instead you end up with closer to $206,000, because even if you withdrew the entire $12,000 at the beginning of the year (such that the first $12,000 earns you no interest), the 3 percent you earn on the remaining $200,000 earns you a full $6,000. You can extend this process out for the same annual withdrawals and the same annual interest for the full 25 years.</p>
<p class="follow">This fixed annual withdrawal is an annuity (much like the annuities you can buy from an insurance company), and there’s a technical formula (called the present value formula for an annuity<a id="px1780"/>) for calculating how much you’d need to start with to generate a given annuity. If you were to plug these numbers into that formula, you would find that the initial $212,000 will last you nearly until the end. (To be precise, you need to start with $213,210.12 if you want your money to last 25 years at 3 percent interest and a $12,000 annual withdrawal.) With each withdrawal, your initial amount does shrink—it just doesn’t shrink as much as you might think, because the interest earns you back part of what you need. This is why you need only a portion of the annual cost of survival times the number of years: Interest will earn you the rest.</p>
<p class="follow">So what is that fraction? As a simple rule of thumb, I suggest 70 percent. In our example above, the fraction is actually just over 71 percent (because $213,210.12 is 0.7107 times $300,000). If the interest rate were higher, the fraction you’d need in savings would be lower. For example, if your interest rate is 5 percent, and everything else remains the same, you need only $173,426.50—or a little less than 58 percent. And, of course, if the interest rate is zero, you’d need all of the money (the full $300,000) <a id="p160"/>to come from savings alone. But 70 percent covers you in most cases, and it’s a nice, simple number.</p>
<p class="follow">So let’s capture all of this in one basic formula for calculating your survival threshold:</p>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<blockquote class="extract1"><p class="left ">survival threshold = 0.7 × (cost to live one year) × (years left to live)</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">You can play around with different values of <em>cost to live one year</em> and <em>years left to live.</em> For example, if you want to retire in Florida, you can do some research to see what that would cost each year. And, of course, you can plug in a higher or lower number of years, too, and see the effect of these changes on your survival threshold.</p>
<p class="follow">Again, keep in mind that this survival threshold is the bare minimum. Once you’ve met that survival threshold, you probably won’t want to retire just yet—it still might make sense for you to keep working to earn money for a higher quality of life than the basic survival threshold can provide. But now you can safely start thinking about at least the <em>possibility</em> of cracking open your nest egg. Once you’ve taken care of your worries about mere survival, you can then start thinking about your net worth peak as a date rather than a number.</p>
<p class="follow">Keep in mind, too, that you can use multiple sources of assets toward reaching your survival threshold. That is, if you have equity in your house, you can decide to downsize and sell the house—or, if you’d prefer to stay in your current home, you can take out a reverse mortgage, one way to tap into the value of your property. If you’re unsure how many years the money must last you or are worried about running out, remember that you can take all or part of your savings to buy an annuity.</p>
<a id="p161"/>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Knowing Your Peak: It’s a Date, Not a Number</h2>
<p class="left ">Okay, let’s say you have met your survival threshold and then some. Now you can afford to think of about when to break open your nest egg for maximum lifetime fulfillment. Again, when you think of your net worth peak this way, the peak is not a number (a specific dollar amount) but <em>a specific date</em> (tied to your biological age). Those are two very different ways of thinking about your financial goals.</p>
<p class="follow">Many of us have been trained to think that our plan for drawing down our savings should be framed in terms of numbers—that is, that once we reach a certain amount in savings, we can then retire and start living off those savings. And there’s no shortage of suggestions about what that number should be. The most simplistic advice, which can’t possibly be right, is for everyone to aim for a single number, such as $1 million or $1.5 million, no matter who you are or where you live. (How can $1 million in savings be the right number for both the healthy, world-traveling person living in San Francisco and the quiet homebody living in, say, Omaha?) No real retirement expert would suggest a one-size-fits-all number.</p>
<p class="follow">Instead, these experts give more personalized advice—basing the recommended number on your actual cost of living, your life expectancy, and projected interest rates (such as a typical annual 4.5 percent rate of return after inflation). Some advisers even take into account the fact that your retirement spending won’t be constant from the start of retirement until its end—thus they <a id="p162"/>tell you that you will need more money at the start of retirement<a id="px1779"/> (your go-go years) than when you’re 10 or 20 years in. So there are definitely various degrees of sophistication in all this retirement-planning advice. But what all this financial advice has in common is the idea of coming up with a single number—one financial target to shoot for and hit before you can safely start to draw down your savings.</p>
<p class="follow">For those people who haven’t saved enough to live on in retirement—either because their income is too low or because they’ve been too much of a grasshopper—the focus on reaching a financial target does make sense. Without such a pinpointed target in mind, people who haven’t saved enough clearly risk ending up living out everyone’s worst-case scenario: running out of money and then being too old to go back to work.</p>
<p class="follow">But a number should <em>not</em> be most people’s main goal. One reason is that, psychologically, no number will ever feel like enough. For example, let’s say the number you come up with (based on calculations like the kind financial advisers recommend) is $2 million. To reach that goal, you can easily justify working longer by telling and convincing yourself that you will be able to enjoy an even higher quality of life if you save up $2.5 million. And by that logic, you can provide for an even higher quality of life by saving $3 million. So where does it end? That’s one problem with a numerical target. To try to keep up with this moving target, you just keep working on autopilot and end up postponing the best experiences of your life.</p>
<p class="follow">To understand why you should think in terms of a date, not a number, you need to recall that enjoying experiences requires a combination of money, free time, and health. You need all three—money alone is never enough. And for most people, accumulating more money takes time. So by working more years <a id="p163"/>to build up more savings than you actually need, you are getting more of something (money), <em>but</em> you are losing even more of something <em>at least</em> as valuable (free time and health). Here’s the bottom line: More money doesn’t equal more experience points.</p>
<p class="follow">Most people forget those costs of acquiring more money, so they focus mainly on the gains. So, for example, $2.5 million does buy you a better quality of life than $2 million, <em>all other things being equal</em>—but all other things are usually <em>not</em> equal! That’s because for every additional day you spend working, you sacrifice an equivalent amount of free time, and during that time your health gradually declines, too. If you wait five years to stop saving, your overall health declines by five years, closing the window on certain experiences altogether. In sum, from my per<a id="p164"/>spective, the years you spend earning that extra $500,000 do not make up for (let alone surpass) the number of experience points you lost by working for more money instead of enjoying those five years of free time.</p>

Your ability to enjoy experiences depends on both your economic ability (the wealth curve shown here) and your physical ability (the health curve).

<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">So, beyond a certain minimum financial survival amount, do <em>not</em> think in terms of a dollar amount. Think of your net worth peak as a date instead.</p>
<p class="follow">Of course, some people already think about when to stop growing their savings in terms of a date. The most obvious dates are age 62 (the earliest date you can choose to start collecting Social Security benefits) and age 65 (when you become eligible for Medicare). And, depending on when you were born, you can start receiving your full Social Security benefits somewhere between 66 and 67. Increasingly, given rising life expectancies, retirement experts recommend that middle-income retirees wait until they’re 70 to claim Social Security benefits, at which point they can receive more than 100 percent of their full benefits.<a id="px1778"/> Now, the date you start collecting benefits and the date you retire don’t have to coincide—but Social Security and Medicare dates <em>do</em> seem to have an effect on people’s choice of retirement age, particularly because Social Security benefits make up a big chunk of most people’s retirement income. The benefits don’t tell the full story, though: Almost two-thirds of American workers say they plan to work past 65,<a id="px1777"/> according to 2016 research by the Pew Charitable Trusts. That is people’s <em>projected</em> retirement age, not their actual retirement age.</p>
<p class="follow">The actual retirement age is often lower, because people sometimes retire before they planned to—usually because of unexpected job loss or illness. Such involuntary retirement is not an insignificant consideration, since it appears to affect more than half of all retirees in recent years: According to a study of <a id="p165"/>nearly 14,000 newly retired workers, 39 percent who retired in 2014 were forced to quit, and another 16 percent were “partially forced.” These numbers, if correct, show that many more Americans retire involuntarily than the official retirement statistics show. Age discrimination against older workers, combined with the stigma of involuntary job loss, apparently causes some workers to say they’ve retired when in fact they were merely forced out of their jobs<a id="px1776"/> and couldn’t find another. Whatever the reason, the most common retirement age<a id="px1775"/> in the United States is actually 62, as is the median<a id="px1774"/>—again, the age at which Americans can start collecting Social Security benefits.</p>
<p class="follow">So when should you actually plan to crack open your nest egg? Put another way, if your net worth peak is a date, what is that all-important date? Well, it’s tied to your biological age, which is just a measure of your overall health. If you take two 50-year-olds (that’s their chronological age), one might have the biological age of a 40-year-old while the other has the biological age of a 65-year-old. The first, “younger” 50-year-old (let’s call her Anne) not only will go on to live longer than the “older,” less healthy 50-year-old (Betty) but will also be able to enjoy both physical and mental activities until an older age. With more good years ahead in which to enjoy experiences, Anne should be aiming for a later peak than Betty—which means that Anne will need to keep adding to her savings longer than Betty does before she can start spending down her net worth on the way to zero.</p>
<p class="follow">In researching this topic, my colleagues and I have now run the earning and spending simulations for dozens of hypothetical people like Anne and Betty, incorporating different scenarios about one’s health, earning growth, and interest rates. Depending on all these factors, we see different net worth curves. As a result, we’ve generated lots of different net worth curves—each <a id="p166"/>one optimal for a given person. In each optimal curve, the person ends up dying with exactly zero, and, because of that, each ends up with a net worth peak sometime before their death date. Here’s what we see: For most people, the optimal net worth peak occurs at some point between the ages of 45 and 60.</p>

Traditionally, people continue to increase their net worth until they stop working, and are afraid to dip much into their principal even after retirement. But to make the most of your hard-earned money, you must crack open your nest egg earlier (starting to spend down your savings sometime between 45 and 60 for most people) so that you end, theoretically, with zero.
</p>

<p class="follow">Let’s look at that more closely. First, let me make clear that 45 through 60 are chronological ages. As noted with the example of Anne and Betty, if a person’s health is excellent (so their biological age is lower than their chronological age), the peak is on the higher end of that range. For the ultra-healthy, the real outliers, the peak might be even higher than 60. And, obviously, if someone has an illness that portends early death, then their peak occurs before age 45. But in general, most people hit their peak between the ages of 45 and 60. That’s what our simulations show: For most people, waiting until they are past this age range causes <a id="p167"/>suboptimal fulfillment results, because they end up dying with more than zero, running out of time in which to have many fulfilling experiences.</p>
<p class="follow">Clearly, earnings growth also has a big effect on a person’s peak. Someone with rapid earnings growth hits their peak early. At the other end of the earnings spectrum are people who need to keep adding to their savings into their late sixties, perhaps even later, if they are to have any discretionary experiences after retirement. But again, in general, most people hit their peak between 45 and 60.</p>
<p class="follow">What does all this mean for you? It means that unless you are an exception, you ought to start spending your wealth down much earlier than what is traditionally recommended. If you wait until you’re 65 or even 62 to dip into your nest egg, you will almost certainly end up working longer than necessary for money you will never get to spend. What a sad thought: to slave away at a job and never get the gold.</p>
<p class="follow">Don’t get me wrong: I’m not telling you when you should retire—as I explain in the next section—only when you should start spending more than you earn.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">“But I Love My Job!” Part II</h2>
<p class="left ">When I first talked about dying with zero, I told you about the people who will understandably protest that they enjoy their work—so what’s the harm with money earned from that kind of “work enjoyment” and seeing it going unused in your life? As I already said there, optimization doesn’t care where the money comes from—once you get the money, you owe it to yourself to spend it wisely.</p>
<a id="p168"/>
<p class="follow">A version of this question comes up when I talk about spending down once you hit your peak: “What, do you really expect me to quit a job I love just because I’ve hit some magical date?” And my answer is no. If you want to keep working, be my guest. Just be sure to ramp up your spending accordingly so that you don’t end up dying with lots of money left over. That would be a waste no matter how much you enjoyed your job.</p>
<p class="follow">I know there are a few lucky souls among us who are indeed “living the dream” and they are doing in life what they always dreamed of doing. These are those rare individuals who can’t wait to get to work each day and who feel bad when they have to go home at night. They truly love what they are doing. But again, those individuals are few and far between. You may be one of them. But if you’re not one of the lucky ones—if you’re more in love with the paycheck you bring home than with the daily experiences of being in your office—then the time has come to do a real gut check on your life and to determine what you really want to get out of it.</p>
<p class="follow">Our culture’s focus on work is like a seductive drug. It takes all of your yearning for discovery and wonder and experiences, promising to give you the means (money) to get all those things—but the focus on the work and the money becomes so single-minded and automatic that you forget what you were yearning for in the first place. The poison becomes the medicine—that’s nuts!</p>
<p class="follow">Look, if all you want is to have a pile of money at the end, well, I guess that’s your choice. But bear in mind that I have never seen somebody’s total net worth posted on their tombstone. Wouldn’t you rather try and figure out what unique experiences you’d like to have for your own, as personal keepsakes for down the road—not only for you but for your family and loved <a id="p169"/>ones? This is precisely why I decided to splurge for that big 45th birthday party.</p>
<p class="follow">I have had this conversation with my friend Andy Schwartz. Andy’s a successful entrepreneur in the adhesives business—glue. He’s in his mid-fifties, married with three children in their twenties and teens, and has no plans to retire even though he could. He’s got lots of reasons: The work continues to challenge and engage him intellectually, he loves spending time with others in his industry, and he feels responsible for the financial well-being of his employees. “If I didn’t like it, if I felt like it was a chore, I would sell it and get out,” he says.</p>
<p class="follow">So Andy is not somebody who’s working simply because he’s afraid he won’t have enough to retire on. He loves the business, and he enjoys growing it—the business itself is a rich source of life experiences for him.</p>
<p class="follow">If you ask him why he likes growing his wealth, given that he is already wealthy, he’ll mention his grandchildren, for whom he wants to provide a cushion, and charities to which he’d like to give money, such as his high school and college.</p>
<p class="follow">“Fine,” I say. “I’m glad you’re content. So continue working and earning more money—but be sure to spend it now! If you want to give money to your high school or college, do it now. If you want to give money to your children and future grandchildren, start to do it now. (For children who are currently too young, set up a trust.) As for the rest, spend it on making the best life you possibly can for yourself.”</p>
<p class="follow">When I tell Andy this, he says his tastes aren’t expensive. He claims he leads a fairly quiet and modest lifestyle. To that I say, “How do you know what your tastes are if you really haven’t done much except work and raise kids?” The truth is, Andy’s business has been such a big part of his life and demanded so <a id="p170"/>much of his attention that he is just not in the frame of mind to think about unique, novel, or stimulating ways to spend his money.</p>
<p class="follow">But if someone challenged him to spend, say, $300,000 on activities that are totally not work-related but actually fun-related, he’d be forced to think differently—and he would definitely discover new activities and pursuits he would love. And I’m not talking about spending money just for the sake of spending the money, either, but to become the fullest and most fulfilled version of Andy that he could be.</p>
<p class="follow">For starters, he and his wife could put their heads together and list their three favorite musical groups. Why not fly out to see them in some destination locale for a weekend? Or he could join TED as a patron member, which costs several hundred thousand dollars and gives you special access to the main TED conference, where he could meet living intellectual legends in many fields. After one trip to TED and talking to these amazing people, he could find 13 different purposes and directions he could go in!</p>
<p class="follow">Trust me—it’s really not that hard to spend a lot of money doing things you love. But you do have to take some time to first consciously figure out what those appealing expenditures are for you. Using himself as an example of this idea, the behavioral economist Meir Statman has said that he finds travel by business class worth every penny—but doesn’t feel that way about fine dining at all. “I can afford a $300 meal, but it makes me feel stupid—like the chef is in the back laughing uproariously.”<a id="px1773"/> The point is that what you spend money on is up to you. Isn’t it worth your while to think about what you value and put your money behind that?</p>
<p class="follow">So if you aren’t ready to quit your job but want to make the <a id="p171"/>most of your money before you die, start spending more than you have been!</p>
<p class="follow">Another strategy for squeezing the most experiences out of your early golden years without quitting your job is to cut back on your work hours if you can. If you’re lucky enough to be working for an employer that offers a formal “phased retirement” program, definitely look into it. Unfortunately, only about 5 percent of all employers offer such programs, according to a 2017 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. However, the percentages are higher in some industries,<a id="px1772"/> such as education and high tech. The good news is that many more employers have informal programs, with managers offering phased retirement to high performers and employees with in-demand skills.<a id="px1771"/> It makes sense: The more valuable you are to your current employer, the more likely it is that they’ll be willing to work with you on your terms.</p>
<p class="follow">In short, be careful not to be constantly seduced by money. Sure, it’s nice to feel appreciated and to be paid well, and employers who value you might tempt you to work longer hours than would be optimal for you. It’s easy to succumb to such temptation: After all, if you are 55 and a valued worker, chances are you’re earning more per hour than you’ve ever earned before. But remember that your goal isn’t to maximize wealth but rather to maximize <em>your life experiences.</em> That’s a big turnabout for most people.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">The Challenge of Decumulation</h2>
<p class="left ">Once you’ve finally determined your net worth peak, you must start spending down, or decumulating. This means you will be spending more in your real golden years, when you are in rea<a id="p172"/>sonably good shape in both health and wealth—between 45 and 60—than people usually do, because most people who save money for the future save for too late in life.</p>

  <b>Spending Over Lifetime</b>

<p class="caption subcaption">
Whether you are spending optimally or spending the way most people spend, your spending in old age is lower than in the middle years, because older people usually don't have the health needed to spend as much on experiences. As a result, unless you spend significantly more in your middle years than most people do, you will fail to die with zero.
</p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="timebreak "> </div>
<p class="follow">Now think back to the concept of time buckets. When I first introduced that tool, I urged you to set aside any concerns about money so that you could see that most experiences naturally fall on a bell-shaped curve that leans a little to the left, your younger years. But what happens when you do begin to put price tags on the experiences you want to have? At that point, the curve will right itself a little, because as your health starts its natural decline, your wealth tends to increase, which means you have more discretionary income for higher-quality experiences. For example, if you enjoy both movies and live theater, you can do either at just about any age, which means you can happily spread them <a id="p173"/>out throughout your life. But once you start thinking about money, you can no longer ignore the fact that theater tickets usually cost a whole lot more than movie tickets, which means that, to get the most enjoyment, you’ll want to shift some of the experiences of live theater to the right, when you’re older and wealthier. But you <em>don’t</em> want to shift them too far to the right, to the point where you’ll be too old to hear the actors or to stand in line for the restroom; at that point in your life, you’d just as soon stay home watching <em>Jeopardy</em> or reruns of <em>The Golden Girls</em>.<a id="px1770"/></p>
<p class="follow">There’s another conclusion you’ll probably reach when you start putting price tags on these experiences: The amount of money you’ll need in retirement is often a lot lower than what you’ve been advised to save. For example, if you’ve been told that during each year of retirement you will need 80 percent or more of your annual pre-retirement income, you will probably discover, after looking at the activities you’ve bucketed for your seventies, eighties, and beyond, that these really don’t cost that much—far less than 80 percent of your previous spending. (Recall the research on the no-go years from chapter 3.) It’s true that some physically undemanding activities—like attending the opera—can be pricey, but you probably don’t even want to go to the opera 70 times within a period of just five years. At a certain point in life, you simply won’t be able to consume above a certain amount of savings—so don’t save too much, and instead plan to enjoy spending that money sooner.</p>
<p class="follow">But even when you include money as a consideration, the curve won’t skew right—you will find that the vast majority of the experiences you want to have will have to happen within about 20 years of midlife, in either direction—in other words, roughly between 20 and 60. People so often talk about saving for retirement. But there are far fewer conversations about saving <a id="p174"/>for excellent and memorable life experiences that need to happen much sooner than the typical retirement age. If you look at the activities that are advertised in retirement commercials—a couple holding hands while strolling on a beautiful beach, a man holding a youngster on his shoulders—you’ll find that you actually want to do most of those things before you’re retired.</p>
<p class="follow">Am I telling you to blow all your money before 60? No. You’ll definitely need income when you’re older, too—so while you’re still working to earn money, you’d better save for that time in your life when you’ll no longer be working. Just realize that time moves in only one direction, and that as it passes it sweeps away opportunities for certain experiences forever. If you keep that in mind as you plan your future, you’ll be more likely to make the best use of every year of time in your life.</p>
<p class="follow">Knowing that you have enough money to last you the rest of your life (by doing some survival calculations) should give you the peace of mind to start spending more aggressively now. But even so, the psychological shift from savings mode to spending mode won’t be easy. Changing one’s deeply entrenched habits never is: If you’ve spent all your life as a good, solid, and committed saver, it’s hard to suddenly shift gears and start doing just the opposite. For people used to accumulating wealth, decumulation doesn’t come naturally. Old habits die hard.</p>
<p class="follow">But doing this is absolutely essential if you are going to make the most of your life energy. Remind yourself that you can’t take your money with you—every dollar you don’t spend at the right time will have far less value to you later, and in some cases it will bring you no enjoyment at all.</p>
<p class="follow">Remember, too, to invest in your health, even if you haven’t done much of that in the past. As I explained earlier, your health massively changes your ability to enjoy all kinds of experiences. <a id="p175"/>So it’s well worth your while to spend time and money improving or at least maintaining your health, whether by joining a ritzy gym (the kind you actually look forward to visiting), hiring a personal trainer, or following along with fitness videos.</p>
<p class="follow">One of my sisters, Tia, has really taken this advice to heart. At 57, she still works in her family’s business, but she redesigned the way she does her job so she no longer sits in a chair for nine or ten hours a day like she used to. She understands that everyone’s muscles atrophy with age, and she’s slowing down the rate of that decline by doing resistance training several times a week. She also regularly swims and takes a spin class. She’s on it! Tia’s not going to run a marathon anytime soon—but through these investments in her health, she’s actively changing her current and future experience of life.</p>
<h2 class="sectionsubtitle">Re-Bucket Your Life</h2>
<p class="left ">As you go through life, your interests change and new people enter your life, so it’s a good idea to repeat the time-bucketing exercise every now and then, such as every five or ten years.</p>
<p class="follow">One of the most important times to re-bucket your life is when you’re nearing your net worth peak. Many people at midlife have forgotten what used to bring them fulfillment and have been too busy taking care of careers and children to explore new interests, either. As a result, many people enter retirement with only a vague idea of what they’ll do with all that free time. Or they have some specific ideas—typically trips they want to take—but only for the first year or two. So after a while, they tend to find themselves adrift, feeling aimless and maybe even itching to go back to work, the one place they know they’ll have a <a id="p176"/>built-in sense of purpose, belonging, and accomplishment. In the worst cases, this sense of aimlessness can even lead to anxiety and depression.</p>
<p class="follow">So before you quit or scale back your job, really think through what you want to do once your work won’t be taking up much of your everyday time. Is there a long-dormant hobby you want to pick up again? A particular friendship you want to rekindle? A new skill you want to learn, or a club you want to join? What adventures do you really want to have—and when do you want to have them? Put those in the appropriate buckets and start making new memories.</p>
<h3 class="sectionsubtitle">Recommendations</h3>
<ul>
<li><p class="follow">Calculate your <em>annual</em> <em>survival</em> <em>cost</em> based on where you plan to live in retirement.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">Consult your doctor to get a read on your biological age and mortality; get all the objective tests you can afford that give you the status of your current health and eventual decline.</p></li>
<li><p class="follow">Given your own health and history, think about when your enjoyment of those activities is likely to start declining in a noticeable way on an annual basis—and how the activities you love will be affected by this decline.</p></li>
