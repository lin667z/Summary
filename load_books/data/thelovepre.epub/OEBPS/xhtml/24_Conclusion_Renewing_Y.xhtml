			<h1 class="x03-Chapter-Title" id="_idParaDest-24">RENEWING YOUR PRESCRIPTION</h1>
			<p class="x03-CO-Body-Text">Ty and Ollie have been together for two years. Ty is from California, and Ollie’s from Nigeria, though he grew up in London, where he and Ty now live together in a small flat. Both men are in their early twenties. In the grand scheme of things, their relationship is brand-new. But they’ve already figured out some of the secrets of success that we see in the “masters” of love.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">When these two lovebirds were less than one year into their relationship, one of the most influential events of our lifetimes began to unfold: the COVID-19 pandemic. Suddenly, they were no longer going out on dates, meeting up with friends, traveling, exploring the city. They were in their small apartment together, 24/7, learning to do their jobs remotely, learning to be in a full-time, full-on, all-day/all-night relationship.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Ty says one of the first things that popped up was their different conflict styles. Ty’s natural tendency was to avoid or shy away from direct confrontation; Ollie’s was to talk it out immediately.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_146" role="doc-pagebreak" title="146"/>“We’d have some moment of friction over who knows what—you know there are plenty of those!” Ty says. “My natural tendency was to be like, ‘Oh, I’ll just bottle that up and hold a grudge. But Ollie would just chase me down and talk it out with me. Whatever it was we’d been fighting about would just be . . . neutralized. Like it didn’t have any power over us anymore. I’d never had that kind of pattern in a relationship before. It feels really good.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They have figured out other stuff, too. How to give each other space. How to do their own thing without pressure from the other partner to do exactly what he’s doing (critical, in a pandemic lockdown!). How to find time to set aside work and social media and other demands and connect with <i>just each other</i>. Their jobs don’t line up wonderfully for this: Ty’s job is on California time; Ollie’s, on London time. Ollie starts early; Ty, in the afternoon. Ty often has to work through dinner, or he says, “I sit there eating with my phone open, tapping out email replies.” So how do they spend <i>quality</i> time together?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“We stay up really late,” Ty says. “We make our own schedule. We’re night owls. We’re up, chatting and playing video games and talking about the future, when most people are asleep.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In the middle of a busy day, if they feel like they need a moment of micro-connection to realign, one will ask the other for a long hug or a “thirty-second lie-down”—so, between Zoom calls, they’ll lie down and spoon for less than a minute. It’s like supercharging a battery.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The biggest challenge for Ty and Ollie—who are at the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_147" role="doc-pagebreak" title="147"/>beginning of what they hope will be a long journey together—is figuring out how to have space for their needs, desires, and dreams while also navigating expectations, worries about independence, and more.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I’d be sitting at my desk writing, having a fantasy about moving to Barcelona, renting a sunny apartment, walking the cobblestone streets, meeting people, and just being a young guy alone in a city,” Ty says.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">In his past relationships, his partners didn’t have great responses to this kind of thing. Ty was loath to bring it up at the risk of a big fight, bad feelings, insecurity, and jealousy.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I had some not nice relationships,” Ty says. “But with Ollie, I just brought it up. I didn’t want to have all this lurking stuff we weren’t talking about. So I said, ‘If I wanted to go to Barcelona without you for a month, would you be OK with that?’ and he basically said, ‘Of course, if that’s what you need.’ ”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They had a big talk. Ty, reflecting on himself, says he thinks all the time about the different lives he could lead—all the possible paths sprouting off from one another, like a tree with infinite splitting branches. He loves Ollie and their life together. But he also longs to be able to explore on his own—to be an autonomous person in the world.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“There’s always going to be a part of me that craves that—the individualized experience,” he says. “But Ollie has made space for it. I can have these whims. I can feel like I have space to move. I can explore these possibilities without him feeling hurt. We can be individuals. Because we can talk about this stuff <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_148" role="doc-pagebreak" title="148"/>openly, I realized that being in a relationship doesn’t have to hold me back from doing what I want to do. I can do it while having a home base.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">As we were writing this book, Ty and Ollie were looking forward to quarantine restrictions being lifted. Soon they’d be able to travel again. They were making plans to visit Ty’s family in California. But for the moment, they were going strong. They celebrated their two-year anniversary in pandemic lockdown. They couldn’t do the kind of anniversary date they normally would do, like go to Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant and drink fancy cocktails at a crowded bar. They had to make some anniversary magic at home. While Ty was making dinner, he heard all kinds of rummaging around in the living room. “Don’t come out here yet!” Ollie shouted.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The big reveal: Ollie had built . . . a fort. He’d pushed the couches together, stacked up the cushions, draped the whole soft castle in pretty blankets. In the middle, he’d created a whole picnic setup, complete with a bottle of wine and nice glasses.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It was a fun and fresh anniversary, despite the pandemic. But these two say that the main thing that keeps them great friends and lovers, even through one of the most turbulent and unpredictable times any of us has ever been through, is that they appreciate each other, all day long.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“All day long, we constantly say at every opportunity we have, ‘Thank you, I appreciate you, you’re wonderful to me,’ ” Ty says. “We say thank you for everything, big or little. For listening to an emotional venting. For making a cup of coffee when he makes <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_149" role="doc-pagebreak" title="149"/>himself one. For everything. And we mean it, and feel it, every time.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Matt and Adrienne live halfway across the globe from Ty and Ollie and have been married for forty-four years—since long before those two were born. They have two children and three grandchildren. And yet, Adrienne says now that she never intended to marry or have kids. If you were to go back in time and tell her that she and Matt would still be married more than four decades later, she would have found it hard to believe.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was the seventies,” Adrienne says, when they met and fell in love. “Nobody was getting married! It wasn’t cool. Plus, I watched my mother stay home and raise five kids. None of the women in my mother’s generation had careers. When I left home to go to college, I didn’t know what I wanted to do, but I knew two things for sure: I was never getting married. And I was never having kids.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">She met Matt in 1974 while working at the student newspaper in college. He was the photo editor, and she worked in the composing room, laying out the copy. He would come in, gaze at her, ask for a date—she always said no. Then she bumped into him at a Halloween party, where he showed up dressed as a mad scientist, with wild hair and a mischievous grin, and she had a change of heart. Standing above him on the house stairs as he chatted with other costumed partygoers drinking keg beer out of SOLO cups, she kicked off one of her shoes, reached her foot down, and ran her toes through his hair.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“It was,” she says, “quite a moment!”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_150" role="doc-pagebreak" title="150"/>Two years later, he asked her to marry him. She said no. No one she knew was getting married. It didn’t seem like marriage was really in a woman’s best interest. But he kept asking. And finally, wanting to make him happy, she agreed.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“I thought, ‘Well, why not—I can always get a divorce!’ ”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">They got married at city hall at nine o’clock in the morning, with their parents for witnesses. He wore a navy cardigan. She wore a blouse and skirt. No wedding rings.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">The years that followed were full of ups and downs. Adrienne was a graphic artist, but gave it up when her children came along. It was too hard, she found, to both parent an infant and work—especially with Matt’s long hours commuting into the city, a four-hour train ride round trip. It was a sacrifice. They moved, several times, for his jobs. She felt like she was giving up too much, but mostly didn’t talk about it.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“The years when the kids were young were the hardest,” Adrienne says. “He worked long hours and had an exhausting commute. We lived far from our families and I never got a break from childcare. And I’d fallen into this traditional arrangement that I’d always said I never wanted. I realize now that I never talked to him back then about how little support I was getting from him. I didn’t tell him what I needed from him. I just stewed silently for years.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">For his part, Matt was having his own struggles trying to establish himself in a cutthroat corporate workplace. He says now, “I just put my head down and charged. I did focus on my career. The responsibility of providing for a family kept me awake at night. But I didn’t share my challenges at the time, either.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_151" role="doc-pagebreak" title="151"/>Since then, Matt has changed careers to one he finds more fulfilling in the public service realm. No longer consumed by raising children, Adrienne has more freedom to pursue her own career, launching a freelance business and returning to the graphic design she was doing pre-motherhood. They both say their relationship is better than ever, and now a source of refuge and support. But that didn’t happen overnight.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">It came gradually, from small course corrections, like letting little stuff go. Talking about needs and issues as they came up, instead of stewing on them. And they started prioritizing time together, to just go out and have fun. They go on adventures almost every weekend: a hike in the woods, a drive to an outdoor sculpture park, a picnic in the snow. They head off on bike rides on a rail trail to a bookstore that Adrienne loves, then stop at Matt’s favorite vintage diner for lunch on the way back. Every year on their anniversary, they do the same thing: they take a bottle of champagne into the woods, find a place with a lovely view to sit, and share a toast. Even in the rain.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Both describe the arc of their relationship as two sets of train tracks—running together, closely in tandem; other times split apart and parallel; then intersecting again. There were times they wondered if they would make it. There was no big revelation that kept them together. There was just the daily work of deciding, moment to moment, that their marriage was worth it, and that they chose it, again and again. Being able to communicate more openly with each other has been huge. They have, at long last, shared their earlier struggles with each other. Each has a far more accurate picture of those harder years, and what it was like for <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_152" role="doc-pagebreak" title="152"/>the other person; they see how they shut each other out, and how that made things even tougher. Adrienne says she doesn’t hold back on sharing her feelings anymore—they are both more vocal about what they’re going through, thinking, and feeling, which nips resentments and misunderstandings in the bud.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“They said it would never last,” she says. “No, really—everybody said it right to our faces: <i>It will never last</i>. Well, guess what, it did.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">What have they learned in forty-four years of marriage?</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">“That you always have to be remeeting each other,” Adrienne says. “You’re not the same person at sixty that you were at twenty. It’s not possible. So you have to notice when you’ve lost track of each other—it happens. I don’t know that you can be together for a lifetime and not experience that. The question is, do you make the effort to get to know each other again? Are you curious? Can you stay friends? That’s what romance is, really. It’s friendship.”</p>
			<h2 class="x05-Head-A">You’ve Come a Long Way This Week!</h2>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text-FL">Over the past week, as you worked through this book, you introduced seven new relationship-building habits into each day. You practiced the key habits of the true masters of love:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-First">You set aside time to check in with each other, asking “What do you need from me today?” <i>Keep going</i>: make sure your schedule moving forward continues to involve healthy routines of connection.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted"><span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_153" role="doc-pagebreak" title="153"/>You asked each other big, open-ended questions, questions that hopefully took you into new territory, where you learned something you didn’t already know about your partner. <i>Keep going: </i>remember that we’re not only creating love maps but also <i>updating</i> them. When it comes to your partner, their inner landscape will always be changing. And that’s what makes it so exciting to know someone intimately for a long time.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">You noticed what your partner was doing right and said thank you for something routine. <i>Keep going</i>: Expressing appreciation is not a one-time job you can check off and be done with. Expressing gratitude and receiving appreciation is an emotional lift that can buoy you both, every day.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">You gave your partner a heartfelt compliment. <i>Keep going</i>: Admiration is something you actively do. Everybody has flaws, and we all get frustrated with one another. But you can choose to balance that out and to keep a sturdy foundation of mutual respect and admiration under your feet by remembering to focus on what’s wonderful, unique, and irreplaceable about this person you are lucky enough to share a life with.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">You practiced telling your partner what you need—<i>before</i> an unexpressed need or desire becomes a source of resentment. <i>Keep going</i>: stay ten steps ahead of resentment by expressing your needs, wants, and hopes when you feel them.</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted">You made it a point to sneak in more sweet intimate moments of physical touch. <i>Keep going</i>: Physical touch and closeness are great for your health, your connection, and your sex life. <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_154" role="doc-pagebreak" title="154"/>Hold hands. Kiss for no reason. Move in for a hug. Your future self, who will probably have better blood pressure and a stronger relationship, will thank you!</p>
				</li>
				<li class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">
					<p class="x07-List-Bulleted-Last">And finally, you declared a spontaneous date. <i>Keep going</i>: don’t stop dating each other—ever! And while spontaneous dates like the one you had this week are great, the best dating advice we can give you is to plan ahead, set a time every week for date night, line up whatever support you need (such as a babysitter), and be militant about protecting it. We are so passionate about couples having date night regularly and right that we wrote a whole book about it called <i>Eight Dates: Essential Conversations for a Lifetime of Love</i>. If you enjoyed this week of practices and want to take the next step, we recommend this one next!</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Here’s our hope for you, after this week: That you felt a little closer to your partner after including these practices in your day. That you two laughed together at some point. That you felt that warm glow of connection, the <i>cha-ching!</i> of coins dropping into the emotional bank account. Maybe you even had a conversation or conflict this week where you were able to draw on that “money in the bank,” and it went a little smoother than usual.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">We talked earlier about the Four Horsemen—criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling—those destructive forces that can come galloping into a relationship when we forget how important these small things are, when they get brushed aside in favor of life’s business and pressures, when they cease to be <i>habits</i>. Your mission now is to make these practices as routine <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_155" role="doc-pagebreak" title="155"/>as brushing your teeth—to solidify them as habits that are a natural part of the rhythm of your day. When you do this, you’re putting a suit of armor on your relationship that the Four Horsemen cannot breach. You’re making your relationship bulletproof.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">By making and maintaining these small changes, you and your partner can entirely change your trajectory. Picture it like this:</p>
			<div class="width_80">
				<img class="fill" src="../images/page_155.jpg"/>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Those lines start out far apart. And their angle changes by only a fraction of a degree as you move from left to right. But inevitably, they come together! John calls this “convergent accelerating trajectories.” Translation: greater change over time through “small things often.”</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So, to solidify your convergent accelerating trajectories, we’d like to ask you to do two things as you move forward from this week:</p>
			<h2 class="x07-List-Numbered-Head">1. Write down your observations.</h2>
			<div role="list">
				<p class="x07-List-Numbered-Subpara-FL" role="listitem">We know, from testing out these interventions on real couples in the lab and in the wild, that these habits truly work to strengthen relationships. But each couple is different. As you tried out these new techniques this week, you may have noticed that some hit home right away. Others you may need to keep <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_156" role="doc-pagebreak" title="156"/>trying, and give them a little time to work their magic. One way you can help that process along is by paying attention to the impact these new little habits have on you and your relationship, and by writing it down to track it.</p>
				<p class="x07-List-Numbered-Subpara" role="listitem">At the end of this book, we’ve provided space for a short and sweet daily journal. Moving forward from today, we’d love for you to begin keeping some notes, at the end of each day, on how you feel you’ve been changing—both you individually (your lens on the world, how you see and experience your day) and the two of you as a couple. Every night, spare a few minutes to flip to the back of this book (or use a separate notebook or journal if you prefer) and jot down a few notes about the small changes you’ve been making and how they feel.</p>
				<p class="x07-List-Numbered-Subpara" role="listitem">It takes only a minute or two, but the data you gather can be invaluable. Maybe some of these practices didn’t do anything revolutionary for you on the single day you tried it. But when you incorporate it into your routine regularly, you’ll see the difference. Keeping some notes on your experience will let you see which practices have a big impact over time—you won’t be able to miss it.</p>
			</div>
			<h2 class="x07-List-Numbered-Head">2. Have a mini “State of the Union” meeting.</h2>
			<div role="list">
				<p class="x07-List-Numbered-Subpara-FL" role="listitem">Once a week for the next month, have a short meeting, just the two of you, on the weekend (or whatever time off you share). We call this meeting the “State of the Union” because your job is to talk only about what’s gone <i>right</i> in your relationship. What felt good this week, between the two of you? Just share that <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_157" role="doc-pagebreak" title="157"/>with each other. And think of three specific things you appreciated about your partner this week, and tell them. For example: <i>I really appreciate how you cleaned the kitchen the other night when I was so tired, without me even asking—it made me feel so taken care of.</i></p>
				<p class="x07-List-Numbered-Subpara" role="listitem">There are plenty of opportunities every day to notice what’s not right, undone, imperfect. Your job at your weekly State of the Union is to recap all your successes, your highs, your ups. You give yourself a weekly dose of positivity and mutual appreciation—a love high five.</p>
			</div>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-1">An additional resource we’d love to point you toward is our free app, Gottman Card Decks, which is full of additional questions and prompts that will help you continue to work on all of the practices we’ve covered this week. We built the app based on the actual card decks we use with couples during our “Art and Science of Love” weekend workshops, but we wanted them to be available to anyone. The app has a variety of decks of questions for you to choose from, including Date Questions, Open-Ended Questions, Expressing Needs, and more. If you want a free, no-strings-attached, easy way to spark conversation and build love maps, this is a great tool to have—literally!—in your back pocket.</p>
			<hr class="transition"/>
			<div aria-hidden="true" class="x04-Space-Break-Orn">•   •   •</div>
			<p class="x04-Space-Break-FL">We want to leave you with this final thought: <i>Love is worth it</i>. It’s worth taking the time, even on the busiest, most chaotic of days, to turn toward your partner instead of barreling on with your to-do list. To sit down together in the middle of all the <span epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_158" role="doc-pagebreak" title="158"/>chaos and talk. To miss a deadline in order to go on a date. <i>It’s worth it</i>.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Good relationships strengthen everything. They boost your mood. They give you a solid bedrock from which to tackle your day, your goals, your dreams. They bring down the amount of stress hormones in your body. They even strengthen your immune system. They counteract all those things that can shorten our lives or make them less vibrant: loneliness, depression, disease. There are all these hidden benefits to a positive relationship that we often don’t think about, or even really know about. But the science is clear: good relationships lengthen your life and make it even more worth living.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">So yes, our days are busy. It never feels like there’s enough time for everything. But love is the important thing—the thing that makes everything else more possible. And as we hope you’ve seen this week, you don’t need swaths of extra time to invest in your relationship. You just need a little bit of time, every day. A small investment that multiplies over time: compound interest.</p>
			<p class="x04-Body-Text">Remember that Nina Simone line: “I want a little sugar in my bowl”? We like to think about it this way: The relationship is a cup of tea you can flavor however you choose. And you can choose to put a little sugar into that cup, instead of salt. When you’re wounded, or raw, or tired, salt hurts. It’s grating, it stings. Sugar makes you feel better. It washes away that sting and bitterness. That’s all you’re really doing, when you add these small things into your day: putting a little sugar into your relationship, to make it sweeter and sweeter.</p>
