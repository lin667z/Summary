   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">How does this title resonate with you? Is this something you believe? Do you actually deserve the best? Or has it happened that you’ve settled for less?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I honestly think we all have. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is very dangerous in relationships because, before you know it, you’ve wasted years of your life with the wrong guy. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This makes me think of Karen. She was 46 when she asked for my help. A mother of two, she had been divorced twice. And both times she had been cheated on by her husband. Karen was attractive, witty, smart, and had everything she could want…except a great love life. When I dug a bit deeper, it became apparent that every single relationship she had ever been in followed the same pattern. The guy was very interested at first, but soon after, he took her for granted...and she let him!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’ve explained before that men will always try to find out how far they can go—even the good guys. As I kept asking why she accepted the disinterest her boyfriends and husbands clearly showed, why she stayed with those men she responded, “I think I don’t deserve any better.” That was her belief and her entire love life had been a reflection of it. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men will always treat you the way you allow them to. They cannot respect a woman more than she respects herself. And that’s the interesting part. The high-value woman believes she deserves the best. A bit like the tagline Mercedes started to use around 2014: “The best or nothing.” That’s her motto. She wants a good and fulfilling relationship and if that’s not possible, she’d rather have fun alone. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What is your belief about what you deserve? Do you truly believe you deserve the unconditional love of a man who won’t go from hot to cold all the time? </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’m using the word “deserve,” not “want.” Most women </span><span class="calibre17">want </span><span class="calibre3">unconditional love. Question is, do they believe they </span><span class="calibre17">deserve</span><span class="calibre3"> it? If you just want it, it will be easy to complain, nag, get mad, or use any form of influence you can think of to change a man’s behavior. It will also be easy to let any bad behavior pass. But if you deserve it, you’ll walk away from the men who cannot give you what you deserve. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A high-value woman never has to wonder where she stands with a guy. It won’t come that far. Any guy who doesn’t show her unconditional interest and love will be filtered out long before. She has better things to do. That’s what finding a great relationship is all about, by the way. Putting a lot of men through a funnel and filtering out the one guy who’s what you’re looking for. </span> </p>
