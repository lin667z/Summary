   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The most important quality of every high-value woman is a strong set of boundaries. She will always value herself more than </span><span class="calibre17">any</span><span class="calibre3"> guy...no matter how great she believes he is, no matter how much she’s in love with him. This is why it needs to be a quality she possesses. Just like anyone else, she too will be blinded by love every now and then. As a guy disrespects her, she might think, “He probably didn’t mean it, he will change. I’ll give him another chance.” Then her quality kicks in, and she thinks, “No, no. I choose me first. I need to enforce my boundaries. Even though I prefer not to lose him, </span><span class="calibre17">this</span><span class="calibre3"> behavior is unacceptable. I’ll assertively state my needs. If he then makes that same mistake again, he’s out!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Ignore him and withdraw whenever he does something you don’t like. If, however, he does something truly disrespectful, you should always state it and show you are ready to walk away, without bluffing…even after thirty-five years of marriage. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman doesn’t ever let men have their way with </span><span class="calibre17">her</span><span class="calibre3"> emotions, time, body, money, or career. And this is a boundary she strongly protects. Every boundary she bends or changes is only changed when he deserved it. It’s never given. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When a high-value woman is in a relationship with a high-value guy, they behave like a team. They both make concessions, but there’s always an equilibrium. Not a quid pro quo where every concession from her needs to be met by a concession from him. The relationship is always a win-win. Never a lose-win or even a win-lose. (She doesn’t want to dominate her guy either.)</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman can get blinded by love, too. But she has previously built in the habit to enforce her boundaries and to stick to her rulebook, even though it might not feel like the right thing to do at the time. One of her rules, for instance, is: “I will only invest myself as much in the relationship as he invests himself in it.” This is a habit she has. When a guy she’s with starts to lose interest, she won’t start to invest more (even though her instinct will want to make her run harder after him). She plays by her rules and doesn’t let them get clouded by her emotions. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Your emotions are never to be trusted. Countless times you’ve had fear, anger, or other negative emotions when they were not needed. I come from a background of panic attacks (I had them for fourteen years while growing up), so I know from firsthand experience how untrustworthy our emotions can be. If you let them rule your life, you’ll be living a severely limited life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Her tolerance level doesn’t change. There are no excuses. Excuses like “He just got out of a difficult relationship, that’s why he’s behaving like this” or “He has a lot of stuff going on at work” or “He promised me he would change” have no meaning to her even though these thoughts might pop up. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You know the funny part about this quality? Her strong personal boundaries protect her from getting played and work as a magnet to attract great guys.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Players don’t like to play games. Silly as that sounds, players, narcissists, and most types of bad men search for weak prey—a woman they can control with the smallest possible investment from their side. They will not stick around the high-value woman because she’s too high maintenance for them. Good for them. They’re weeding themselves out. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">High-quality men, however, love to work hard for what is dear to them. They don’t mind making a major investment. That’s the way they’ve been living their lives for a very long time. They didn’t become great guys by choosing the easy road. So meeting a woman who has high standards only makes them more attracted to her. They love women who have strong personal boundaries and are confident enough to know what they want and demand it. High-quality men always respect women who do not tolerate manipulative games and have solid standards. Those standards need to be realistic, of course. Some women have impossible standards. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Both high- and low-value women attract losers and bad men. The difference is a low-value woman will stick around and wait it out, hoping he will change...or worse, thinking this is the best she can get. She will accept his disinterest or his constantly fluctuating interest. </span> </p>
