   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’m not sure what camp you belong to, but I’ve seen my fair share of feministas. These were women who wanted to split the bill after the first date, got annoyed when you open a door for them or pull out a chair, and wanted to take care of the heavy lifting in the house because “women can do this too, you know.” Well of course they can! No sane man will ever deny this! But here’s the challenge these women fail to see. If you don’t let him help in the early stages where you literally set the stage, why would he do it later on?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ll need to trigger his “I want to take care of my woman” instincts from the very beginning. This is necessary for three reasons:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre3">He needs it! He cares for the woman he loves. And he loves the woman he cares for! For the love of you, allow him to care for you.</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="2" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre33"> <span class="calibre3">This is potty training your guy. If and when he learns to put in an effort from the get-go, he won’t mind doing it 5 to 65 years down the line.</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="3" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre34"> <span class="calibre3">This is a great filter to weed out the bad guys. Guys who play games or who are in any way not really interested in you will only do the bare minimum to still get what they want. This could be sex, often, but it can also mean getting a home cooked meal every night or anything else you do for him. The more effort you see him put into you and the relationship, the more he really likes you…regardless of what he says! A guy who says “I’m not ready for a real commitment,” but mows your lawn, takes out your trash, fixes your tire, pays for the dates, or makes life easier for you is a far better catch than a guy who says “I see us getting married someday” but doesn’t put in any effort. Words are cheap; actions are priceless. The high-value woman knows this very well. She doesn’t see it as her losing control when he says “step aside honey, let me fix this.” She considers it a job well done!</span> </li>
