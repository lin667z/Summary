   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I want to lean in one other way to get him to do something. I’ve already mentioned that nagging never works, and I’ll keep proving it throughout this book.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nevertheless, what are you to do when you need a household chore done? Or when you just really want him to help you out with something? I’ve tested the strategies I’m about to give you on more than one hundred women who used them to make their boyfriends or husbands </span><span class="calibre17">do</span><span class="calibre3"> something. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s look at the example of Rebekah, a 36-year-old woman married to a great but far from a perfect husband. There are many chores around the house William just never took care of. He’s an interior designer with his own thriving company. Surely enough, this takes a lot of his time. Nevertheless, the doorknob on the bathroom door kept falling off, and Rebekah had asked William, time and time again, to fix it. She hated herself when she had to nag, but she didn’t see any other way. So I asked her to stage the following: on a Sunday, when he was home, she took out the toolbox and headed up to the bathroom door where she started to make all kinds of noises with the tools. It took William less than a minute to rush in and ask, “What are you doing, honey?” Rebekah replied, “Oh nothing, I’m going to fix the doorknob.” He immediately took over the tools and helped her. The door was fixed within ten minutes. No nagging needed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What had happened here? When a man likes a woman, he likes to take care of her. He will never respond well to nagging. Nonetheless, the feeling that his wife had to take care of such a manly task made him feel less of a man, urging him to take over and fix it. Instead of nagging, just tell him you’ll take care of it. Before you know it, he’ll try to convince you that </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> should do it. Men...</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Another great strategy used by the high-value woman is to ask </span><span class="calibre17">another man</span><span class="calibre3"> to help her with something. She asks her guy to do a certain chore, twice, without nagging. He doesn’t do it? Fine. “Hey John, I called my brother/colleague/friend to ask him over for dinner with his wife on Saturday. I told him about _______ that needs to get fixed, and he told me he was happy to look at it.” You can bet money on it that whatever needed fixing will be fixed before Saturday. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Never underestimate a man’s ego. He’s governed by it. He’ll do anything within his power to still believe he is </span><span class="calibre17">the</span><span class="calibre3"> man. If another guy needs to take care of something for you...he isn’t, he has failed. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I love these strategies because they are very effective and also help you weed out the bad men! If you don’t overuse and misuse these strategies—if it doesn’t become obvious why you’re doing it to him—any man who still loves you, who still sees you as his woman, will go to great lengths to take care of you. If he doesn’t, if he says, “Great. I’m glad that John can take care of it. I’ll go out golfing with my friends” or anything similar, consider that a major red flag.</span> </p>
