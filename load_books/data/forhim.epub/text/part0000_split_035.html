<h1 class="calibre14" id="calibre_pb_83"> <a class="calibre15" id="_Toc463016734"><span class="calibre16">When it’s over, be gone</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We all get one chance per person, per lifetime. High-value women get that and move on. It’s true. Look around you. If you see examples of people getting back together after a breakup, you’ll see them breaking up again later down the road, for the </span><span class="calibre17">exact</span><span class="calibre3"> same reasons that lead to the first breakup. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Yet, so many women stay emotionally attached to their ex, working on strategies to get him back. This is a waste of energy. High-value women will never try to keep someone who doesn’t want </span><span class="calibre17">them</span><span class="calibre3"> around. This is too a sign of self-respect and dignity. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It will hurt, deeply. You can cry about it, feel depressed for a couple of weeks, but these are the types of wounds that time </span><span class="calibre17">does</span><span class="calibre3"> heal. But the wound can only heal if you stop picking at it. This means </span><span class="calibre18">no contact</span><span class="calibre3"> whatsoever with the ex. No subtle messages with a question mark in it in hopes of getting a sign of life from him. Nothing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">All that will do is point out to him that he made the right decision leaving you since these are clear signs of having no self-respect. He wants a strong woman, and this here is weak behavior. Men don’t walk away from a woman lightly. When they </span><span class="calibre17">do</span><span class="calibre3">, they have made up their mind. They want someone else, someone different, someone better than who you were during that relationship. The more you’d then start to push him, the more you will prove he made the right decision. He can get better. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s a stupid tendency most men have, even the great guys. Give them a Porsche, and they’ll think they can get their hands on an even more expensive supercar. To put it bluntly, again, if a man can get his hands on what men would call a 7/10 without too much effort, he’ll believe he can get an 8, maybe even a 9 </span><span class="calibre17">with</span><span class="calibre3"> effort. If he breaks up with you or rejects you and you keep handing yourself over on a silver platter, thus making it super easy to get you, you are forcing him to realize he </span><span class="calibre17">can</span><span class="calibre3"> get better than you (even if he really can’t and is the dumbest idiot alive). He has made up his mind.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Protect your dignity and self-respect as if your love life depends on it. It does.  When it’s over, be gone. </span> </p>
