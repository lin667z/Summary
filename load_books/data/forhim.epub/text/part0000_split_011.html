   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I was eating out in a restaurant with my girlfriend. It was the kind of place where the tables were really close, making it impossible to not overhear other’s conversations. There was a couple sitting next to us. I assume the man was in his early forties while the woman looked about thirty-five. Their conversation went something like this:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“Where do you want to go after this?” the man asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“I don’t know. You can choose,” she replied. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“No but where would you like to go?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“Wherever you want to go,” she said.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This went on for a while.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“What kind of wine would you like?” he asked.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“Whatever wine you prefer,” she said.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Needless to say, it was clear this was making him more and more nervous. They finally got in a heated argument where he said, “I don’t want to decide everything. It’s as if I’m sitting here with a four-year-old girl.” Truth be told, that was rude. But he had a point. She clearly had no opinion or will of her own, and this was making him crazy.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I guess you’d feel this exact way if you were in a relationship with a guy who always wanted to do what you want, liked what you liked, and wanted you to call </span><span class="calibre17">all</span><span class="calibre3"> of the shots. Sounds great at first, but it gets boring super fast. We all prefer to be with someone with a backbone. Someone who has a clear opinion. Someone who won’t always give in. This is another reason why men test women. They want you to resist them! They want you to take the lead whenever you feel like it. He wants to please you, too!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A man never takes for granted a woman with a mind of her own, her own rules, and opinions. You may be thinking, “Well duh, Brian, of course!” Question is, did you ever hide your opinion or forgot about your own rules simply to avoid making him upset? Or worse to please him? It happens to the best of us.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s OK to please the one you love, as long as there is an equilibrium. If a woman wants to please her guy to get him to like her more, there is, by definition, no equilibrium. She’s doing it for all of the wrong reasons.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There’s a strange insight about men that I want to give you. Men love to work hard to get and help a woman they like (this final part being the crucial part). It’s been engrained in their instincts to want to take care of their woman. However, men hate it when a woman doesn’t hold her own, when she becomes dependent on him. Not financially, of course, but emotionally. He wants to know what you’re passionate about, what makes you tick, and what makes you love life. That’s why any man quickly gets bored of the nice girl who makes her life revolve around him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The more you </span><span class="calibre17">need</span><span class="calibre3"> him, the less he will want you. The more you </span><span class="calibre17">want</span><span class="calibre3"> him, the more he will need you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A strong independent woman wants a man. A sweet, soft, nice girl needs a man; she feels incomplete without one. If this happens to be how you feel, you have two options.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre3">Don’t show him you need him. Partake in extra activities just to make sure that he cannot and will not become the center of your life.</span> </li> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre33"> <span class="calibre3">Work on your mental strength. Whenever you feel the “I need him” trap coming closer, consciously decide what’s happening and tell yourself this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you try not to lose him because you need him, the higher the probability he will eventually leave just because of this.</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Always be prepared to walk away and make him know and feel this. You can keep using the “ignore him and withdraw when he’s bad and love him when he’s good” attitude. This will send a very clear message to him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And just in case he still doesn’t get it, be assertive! Say, “You must have mistaken me for one of those women who puts up with this crap. I won’t.” </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">The high-value woman always keeps him guessing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">He never knows where he really stands with her. He knows she likes him, of course, she doesn’t hide it, but he never knows how much. She doesn’t throw I love yous around. He never knows when he’ll have sex with her again. Nothing ever is solely on </span><span class="calibre17">his</span><span class="calibre3"> terms. Both he and she are equal in the relationship, with often a little bit more power to her. She keeps him on his toes and makes sure there’s always a bit or mystery, regardless of how many decades they’ve already been together. </span> </p>
