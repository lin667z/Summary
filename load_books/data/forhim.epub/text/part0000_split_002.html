   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let me start off by explaining I am in no way talking about the sexual act. Fuck him in this case is not physical, it’s mental.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So many women get in trouble in their love lives, and 99.9 percent of that trouble could have been avoided if they’d said, “Well, fuck him!” a bit more often. Too many women are way too nice and compliant to their men, especially when these men don’t deserve that kind of treatment.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And yet, every woman I’ve ever met tries to not be needy or wear her heart on her sleeve. She simply wants to protect her feelings. Nevertheless, most women I’ve coached have had men seem very interested only to disappear suddenly. These women are left standing in the dark. Once the guy vanishes, they often find out it’s easier to get the President of the United States on the phone than the man who seemingly really liked them...just not enough to stick around.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This should stop.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I, as a dating coach and author of books for women who want to get men, cannot take it anymore. You deserve better. This is not your fault. It’s his! He needs to learn to be much more transparent and upfront. That said, we both know most men won’t change. We can lead a horse to water, but we can’t make it drink. Or can we? What if there was a way to change a guy’s behavior? What if you could get into his head and take over the driver’s wheel? What if you could make him do more of the things that you appreciate and need and less of the bad behaviors you dislike? At first, this might seem impossible. Nevertheless, I’m sure you’ve already met women who are good at manipulating their men.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Enter the high-value woman. You know her. You’ve seen her. She’s the woman who always has great men drooling over her. It’s the woman you see getting all the attention. You often wonder, “How does she do it? What do they see in her? What does she know that I don’t?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You might have even complained to your girlfriends that men just don’t seem to notice what a catch you are. Your girlfriends may have even said, “He doesn’t know what he’s missing.” What if you could </span><span class="calibre17">make</span><span class="calibre3"> him </span><span class="calibre17">see</span><span class="calibre3"> it?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When you look at these high-value women who get their way with men, it might have surprised you that their looks don’t seem to matter. The high-value woman can be great looking, average looking, or even bad looking. It doesn’t matter. She knows her way around men. She knows how to </span><span class="calibre17">mentally </span><span class="calibre3">fuck them. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let me get straight to the point. A great guy can find hundreds of women who will give him what he needs on a physical level. The physical aspect of relationships, although important, is not really special to most men. When a man gets it (sex), his hunger is gone. I’m sure you’ve seen this plenty of times. That said, men cannot easily find a woman who can fuck them mentally. These women are much more rare. When a guy finds one of these exceptions, he latches on like a clueless fly that chose your windshield wiper as a landing spot prior to you getting on the freeway. It will try to hold on like its life depends on it...because it does. A great guy will not let go of a woman he deems as high value.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ll see behavior you’ve never seen from him. He’ll start to put in an effort that makes you feel like you’re a queen because to him, you are. At first, it will be strange. If you’ve never truly been in control of a man, it might feel like riding a horse for the first time. But soon, it will make you feel all tingly inside.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’m not kidding.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There’s nothing more powerful than being in a relationship with a guy and having him do exactly what you want while he thinks it was his idea. (This is important, as you’ll see. He needs to think </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> is the one in the driver’s seat, even though you actually are.) </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This book is not about becoming someone you’re not or turning your boyfriend into a spineless manslave. It’s about your empowerment, about taking back what’s yours. No man should ever be able to play games with you, to take you for granted, to treat you even a tiny bit less than you deserve. By the time you’ve finished this book, this will all be part of your past.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’m still not kidding.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Some of these high-value women were born with this gift. Most, however, have had to learn it. Most of my clients found me because they had reached their breaking point. They’d had enough. These women noticed that all the relationships they were in, or tried to get in, ended on the same dead-end street. So </span><span class="calibre17">they</span><span class="calibre3"> had to be doing something wrong. </span><span class="calibre17">They</span><span class="calibre3"> had to change something. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’re about to get all of the insights you’ll need to really understand men. You’ll read all of the tricks to getting men to treat you the way they should and the way you deserve.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman knows how to control men. Not in a bad way. Needless to say, they don’t achieve this by becoming a nagging dictator in the relationship. Far from it. Nagging is not even in their dictionary. They never nag, yell, or pout. They don’t need to. They know a whole range of psychological facts about men that help steer the men they date. You’ll also see that they don’t become bad women. They treat men with respect at all times just as they expect respect in return. And that’s exactly what they get—a man who doesn’t even think about playing games, who values their time, and most importantly, their heart.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre1"/><span class="calibre3">Furthermore, these women are best at repelling bad men—men who won’t bring anything to the table in the relationship. They’re also great at spotting dishonest men who try to play games or hide their real motives.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Are you curious to find out how they do it? Then read on!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">How come I know this “high-value woman” so well?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’ve met and seen her countless times. I’ve been coaching people all over the world since 2005. I’ve written a couple of best-selling books, have coaching courses and programs and for a select group of people do some personal coaching. The only way to give so many people massive value is to know why people do what they do. To get to that point, I’ve made it my habit, starting in the early 2000s, to interview hundreds of people every year. I ask them for their secrets, I ask them why they believe they are in a happy relationship and why they stepped out of previous ones. As I continued to do this, I started to see a line of recurring strategies used by people who were very successful in finding and keeping a great relationship. I noticed high-value women were all using the same mindset. There were several similar behaviors and strategies. After interviewing close to a thousand of them over the years, I started to explain these strategies to the women I personally coach.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The results were massive.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s why I decided to write this book. Even though I’ve already authored several others, I wanted to write a book that solely focuses on how the high-value woman would behave in a set of situations. I also write this book because so many other guides and self-help books on the market are riddled with mistruths; women who claim to know how men think have written these books. These authors have no idea, as proven by the examples used within their pages.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I get it. They want to sugarcoat everything and include insights about men; they want to make sure women </span><span class="calibre17">enjoy</span><span class="calibre3"> reading the book. That makes sense. However, when the information is dead wrong, it’s not helping anyone. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nevertheless, if you’ve read any of my books, then you’ll know I use a different approach: I tell it like it is. I respect women so much that I’m sick and tired of the games some men play. But what bothers me even more are the women who lose out on a great relationship because they don’t get the reactions of the guy they’re with and lose him as a consequence. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You can expect me to step on your toes here and there throughout this book. Some of what I’ll say will be blunt, even hard to take. Please realize that I do this because I have the utmost respect for women, for you. I love and appreciate women more than you will ever know. That’s exactly the reason why I chose to be blunt in writing this book. I want you to see men for what they really are, but I also want you to see some of the misguided behaviors that can get a woman in trouble in her love life. Most men have not been honest with you, often in an effort to not hurt your feelings. Sometimes they were just playing games and didn’t care at all. That’s why I want to tell you the cold, hard truth. That’s why I write books. I want to lift the veil so you can see clearly from now on. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Can you handle the truth?</span> </p>
