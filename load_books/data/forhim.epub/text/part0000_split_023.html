   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Your attention doesn’t come cheap. Getting his attention shouldn’t be too valuable at first. When I look at the list of women I’ve coached over the years, a large portion of them made the mistake of seeking the attention, the approval, or even the love of the men they’d just met. This is an easy way to signal needy behavior to men. Even when you are not needy at all!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I get it. We all want to feel important and get some love. Receiving attention from someone we’re attracted to feels better than almost anything in this world. Yet this is exactly where high-value women make the difference and </span><span class="calibre17">earn</span><span class="calibre3"> their value. His attention doesn’t mean anything to them, at first, since he has not proven to be worthy or high value himself. This is not something he can prove with his looks or a couple of hours of conversation. It takes a long series of dates and seeing how he responds in a variety of situations for him to build up the value she accords to him.</span> </p>
