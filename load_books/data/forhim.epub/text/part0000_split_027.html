   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Bad men have a tendency to limit their investment in the women they’re with. That’s the red line that links all of the types of bad men together.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here are two quick examples. Losers will text you to keep in touch. Great guys might be less communicative (since they are busy), but when they do get in touch, they’ll pick up the phone, actually dial your number, and spend time talking to you. This is a different investment, isn’t it?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Low-quality men will cancel dates, change plans, or call for a last-minute get-together. They don’t value your time. High-quality men value their time </span><span class="calibre17">and</span><span class="calibre3"> yours. When they set a date, it’s as important as everything else in their calendar. They wouldn’t think about canceling it. They also rarely call for last-minute get-togethers since they know and assume you have important things to do as well. They presume you’re not waiting around for them to call.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s what high-value women play into. They force this behavior upon the men they meet. Losers and bad men will quickly dismiss themselves; they won’t be able to stick by those rules. Good men wouldn’t want it any other way. Most often this rule will not even have to be enforced. And just in case it has, the high-value woman will say something to the tune of, “I think you have me mistaken for another type of woman. I don’t like men who (fill in what you dislike).” This is not nagging; this is simply stating a fact. </span> </p>
