   <h1 class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre16"> </span> </h1> 
   <h1 class="calibre20"> <a class="calibre15" id="_Toc463016702"><span class="calibre21">Men are always looking for challenges. All great men who have ever lived were chasing after multiple achievements, goals, and milestones throughout their lives. Men can chase money, fame, women, a title, all of the above, and more. Chasing they will.</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman knows this all too well. She considers herself to be a prize—one he needs to chase after. She will not always be available; she will not always answer his calls; she will most often not give him what he wants. Yet, she doesn’t play any games either.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Can you see why?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If she were to play games, a great and smart man would see right through them. Games are an effort to make a man like you more. Games are a way to get his approval.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A woman who plays games is perceived as weak by great guys who, again, see right through them. The nanosecond men know a woman is doing something under the radar in an effort to be liked, they lose all the value they had been building. What do you feel when you realize a guy is on his knees, trying to kiss your feet to get you to like him more? It’s a feeling nobody likes. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When the high-value woman doesn’t have time for him, it’s not a game. She truly doesn’t have time for him because she has other important stuff to attend to… even if it’s just reorganizing her sock drawer. When she doesn’t answer his call right away, it’s not because she wants to make him wait. It’s because she really does have something more important to do first.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This behavior fucks with him. Big time. He’s left wondering, “Wow, this is the first woman I’ve called who didn’t call me back right away” or “Wow, this is the first woman I’ve asked out on a second date, after a great first date might I say, who didn’t jump on the opportunity. She even asked to postpone it a couple of days because she’s busy.” This is the challenge all men are looking for. All men. Even those who claim they don’t like it. If there weren’t a chance of losing, men would not love winning so much! </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This doesn’t just apply in the beginning of the relationship, mind you. All along the life the two of you will spend together. That’s why it’s so important to not play games. You can’t keep them up anyway. All of this has to be real. He has to fall for the</span><span class="calibre17"> real</span><span class="calibre3"> you. I’ll teach you how later on. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ve heard it a gazillion times: “Just be yourself!” Question is, who is that exactly? What does this mean? Is a needy woman who nags still herself? No, she’s not. He’s bringing out the worst in her, and she lets it happen! The high-value woman won’t let him transform her into a nagger. She holds the cards over herself at all times.</span> </p>
