<h1 class="calibre14" id="calibre_pb_37"> <a class="calibre15" id="_Toc463016713"><span class="calibre16">The probation period</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman lets every man she considers for a long-term relationship go through an extensive probation period. Even though her primal instincts and oxytocin levels might be screaming, “Latch on and NEVER let this guy go! He’s the one! He really is. YES, you found him. Your worries are over. You’ll be all right. From now on, the sun will shine every day. Just don’t let him go. You’ll never ever find another man, especially not a great guy like this one. I mean, it </span><span class="calibre17">feels</span><span class="calibre3"> so right, doesn’t it? So it MUST be that he is the one!” The high-value woman looks at this for what it is:  the love radio station. She rarely tunes in because she knows her emotions are untrustworthy. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Every single guy, even “the one,” needs to go through a probation period. She wants to get to know him </span><span class="calibre17">well</span><span class="calibre3">. The high-value woman knows every man will show his best game early in the relationship. She wants to sit that part out before she makes up her mind. She also wants to see how he behaves when life is not treating him well, when he’s let go at work, when he’s sick, when he loses out on an important contract, when the waiter brings him the wrong dish, when his car has been scratched in the parking lot, etc. She wants to observe him and get to know him well.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And here’s the trick. She observes. She keeps quiet about what she sees. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If he does a no-no, she takes notes. She won’t complain, nag, or get mad. She wouldn’t want him to change his behavior </span><span class="calibre17">just</span><span class="calibre3"> because she got mad, just because he wants to avoid a fight.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">In case this needs a bit of explaining, men hate fights. They prefer to have their arm bitten off by a hungry alligator with smelly breath than to get in yet another fight that makes no sense to them (it never does). Many studies have been done around this subject, especially by the Gottman Institute. We don’t need studies, however. Every woman who has ever had a fight with a man knows that men cannot handle the emotions that erupt during a fight. They might seem to not care on the surface, but studies show their physiological reactions (heart rate, sweat, etc.) not only go up but stay elevated for hours after the fight has been over. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Since no sane man likes these feelings, he’ll go through great lengths to avoid them. This includes hiding the fact that he started smoking again, hiding the fact that naked porn stars seem to have found the hard drive of his computer again, even though he promised to never ever do these things again.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s one of the many reasons why nagging is not a good idea. Nevertheless, the high-value woman wants to see how he behaves in his natural habitat, when he thinks no one is judging him. She wants to make sure she gets to know the </span><span class="calibre17">real</span><span class="calibre3"> him as quickly as possible. The real him is the guy who will always resurface later in the relationship anyway, so she wants to make sure she loves</span><span class="calibre17"> that</span><span class="calibre3"> part of him too.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When his report card has too many bad points, she’s out of there. She doesn’t ask him to change, complain, or wait it out. She knows he won’t change.</span> </p>
