   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men are afraid of women who need to be saved. These are women who currently are in a bad relationship or women who are unhappily single. Needless to say, the high-value woman never stays in an unhappy relationship. She has better things to do with her time than to wait around for a guy to get his act together. She prefers to be single. And when she is single, she enjoys it. Her life is never solely built around “finding a man who will love me.”  She has the urge to find a great guy. We all want someone to share our lives with. It’s programmed into our DNA. But even when she’s in a relationship, her guy will never be the center of her life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And that’s the crucial part. Men are afraid of women who make </span><span class="calibre17">them</span><span class="calibre3"> the center of their lives, their only source of true happiness. Unhappy singles signal this quality to the men they meet. Lower quality men might look this over because </span><span class="calibre17">they</span><span class="calibre3"> are happy to get some attention too. The high-quality men, however, can be picky and will not forgo this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Although looks are important to most men, any great guy will always pick a less good-looking woman who’s confident, content, and full of self-love over the needy but super attractive bombshell.</span> </p>
