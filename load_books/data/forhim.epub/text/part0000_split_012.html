   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men are governed by their egos. It’s their primary motivator. Dumb men are </span><span class="calibre17">only</span><span class="calibre3"> ruled by their ego. Say something that hurts their ego and they will erupt in anger or tears. Smarter men are a bit more emotionally intelligent and try to decide whether an emotion is valid or not. Nonetheless, they still need to manage all those emotions their egos give to them.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It will come as no surprise, but men like to feel important. The more important you are to a man, the more it will matter that </span><span class="calibre17">you</span><span class="calibre3"> show how important he is to you. Besides sex, this is your second most important weapon! Play his ego right and he will behave like a cute puppy while </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> thinks he is in control (this is important to his ego).</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let me be blunt. Most women are looking for security. You might be the exception that confirms the rule, but most women are designed to look for a great guy and then make sure he stays with them forever. Men are different. They are looking for power. That’s their number one priority.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Think about it. How many women did you ever see end up in jail because of fraud or setting up a Ponzi scheme (like Bernard Madoff). A Ponzi scheme is designed to fail from the start. Just in case you haven’t heard of a Ponzi scheme, here’s how this works.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Mr. Fraud opens an investment firm and says, “Give me your money, and I’ll give you an interest rate of 10 percent (a number that’s clearly higher than the current market rates).” Mr. Ibelieveinfairytales is hesitant and skeptical, so he says, “Here, I’ll give you $10,000 to see how that goes.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Over the next few months, Mr. Fraud finds a lot of Ibelieveinfairytales men and women and rakes in $200,000. He goes back to the first investor and says, “Here is $11,000 back. Your initial $10,000 plus 10 percent.” That money simply came from the other dreamers. He uses their money to pay back his first investors.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Ibelieveinfairytales thinks to himself, “Wow! That actually worked. Mr. Fraud is not a fraudster or a liar; he clearly must know what he’s doing. I’m going to give him $100,000 now so he can do the same with it. YES! I’m going to be rich soon.” And he does. Mr. Fraud now uses that money to give the other dreamers their money back plus interest, a lot of them are in awe and invest even more because they too see the dollar signs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This system, a Ponzi scheme, works great...until it no longer does. Then it falls down like a house of cards. Mr. Fraud can live a lavish lifestyle and swim in money. But since he never invested any of the money, he’s losing money from the start. He can only keep paying people back as long as new people keep investing (since he always uses that money to pay back earlier investors). When the market crashes, or when anything happens in the world that makes new investors hold on to their money or worse, people ask for their money back, his system fails. This will always happen at some point, of course. Mr. Fraud is then sent to jail. I never got this. Ponzi schemes always fail eventually. So why do so many people try to set them up? Because they are addicted to money and the power it brings.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Why are there generally no women </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3"> stupid to set up a Ponzi scheme? Because they are not, in general, blindly and stupidly driven by power. Most men will do almost anything if they believe it will give them more power. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">ALL men are driven by their ego. </span><span class="calibre3">And if you use this wisely, you can drive men.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I admit I’m no different. When my long-time girlfriend states something as a fact, my instinct is to always say, “No, in fact...” and then to try and prove her wrong. That’s my ego talking. I, of course, overrule it and really listen to what my loving girlfriend has to say. But still, the instinct is there; my ego is always trying to be right. I cannot change it. I can overrule it, but the basic instinct is there, in all men.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You can use this to your advantage. All you need is some reverse psychology. This is not playing a game by the way; it’s simply using the knowledge you have about what works best on men.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let me give you an example. You’re used to your car going to the left when you turn the steering wheel to the left. If I’d give you a car where this is inversed, it would take you a day or two and you’d be driving around like nothing happened.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre37">Men are to be treated like this. Most of what makes them tick makes no sense at all and is the exact opposite of what it should be. Simply accept this and use it. If you want your guy to stay home more often, tell him to go out more! If you want your man to clean up his mess more often, don’t clean it up for him, don’t nag, don’t even say anything about it. Just drop your mess on top of his, make the place even messier, and before you know it, </span><span class="calibre38">he</span><span class="calibre37"> will be the one saying to clean up more...and he’ll do it too! If you want your boyfriend to text you more, text him less. If you want your man to appreciate you cooking for him, cook less for him or cook him some really simple meals. If you’re dating a guy and you want to go steady with him, tell him you’re not sure he’s the right guy to date. </span><span class="calibre18">In short, do the exact opposite of what would make sense.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There are two reasons why this works. First, the challenge builds up. I’ve already discussed to great extent why giving a man a challenge works so well. It’s like throwing a stick for a dog; he can’t help but run after it. Second, he’ll think all of this is HIS decision, just the way his ego likes it. A man will for instance never ask a woman to marry him until he believes it was </span><span class="calibre17">his</span><span class="calibre3"> decision. His fragile ego wouldn’t be able to live with itself knowing he got trapped into a marriage. His ego doesn’t want to be told what to do. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So if you want him to do something, tell him not do to it. Childish, abysmal, totally ridiculous? I know. But that’s the way we, men, function. And it’s good for you, the woman. Once you get his basic functioning, it will be easy to steer him into any direction you want.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">My girlfriend is really good at this!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When we were about to move in together, I got a rush of commitment fear. We were packing up her belongings in her then apartment. I had been a bachelor all of my life, going from one adventure to the next. So my ego realized my life was over and was never ever going to be the same again. (Silly ego. My life is much better now.) My girlfriend, the high-value woman she is, noticed my fear and said, “Don’t worry. I’m not putting a ball and chains on your ankles; you can throw me out whenever you want.” My fear dissipated faster than snow would melt in the Las Vegas desert.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What had happened here? Remember the inverted steering wheel? My girlfriend used it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Her logical response would have been, “I see fear in your eyes. Do you still love me? Where is this going? I don’t want to be wasting my time here. We’re going to get married eventually, right?” This would have made my ego so scared that I might not have been able to overrule it. But she knew that to get what she wanted, she had to steer in the opposite and illogical direction. She gave my ego control. I thought, “Aha! So I can throw her out whenever I want? Then there must be no risk. I do like her a lot, so there’s no need to worry.” And my ego (and I) behaved exactly the way she wanted.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The lesson here is: don’t always say what you want him to hear. Say what he </span><span class="calibre18">needs</span><span class="calibre3"> to hear to do what you want! My ego thought it was in control. Yet, </span><span class="calibre17">she</span><span class="calibre3"> had been the one with the power all along! Reverse psychology works well on three-year-old boys, and it continues to work well on men of all ages. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I once interviewed a high-value woman who was really good at this. Whenever she wanted something done, she gave her guy a couple of options. She would say, “Honey, what do you prefer? Do you want to go to the park on Sunday, or would you rather visit that new exhibition in town?” His ego was happy. It thought it was in control and got to choose. But both options were of course fine for our high-value woman in this example. And if she really wanted to lead him into one direction, she just chose an option that she knew </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> wouldn’t like. “Hey honey, quick question: Would you rather have me vacuum the living room on Sunday (while he’ll be watching the game) or do </span><span class="calibre17">you</span><span class="calibre3"> have time to do it on Saturday?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Guess what he’ll pick? And the funny thing is, his ego will love it! It got to be in control...so it believes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Clearly, you’ll need to pick your battles. You can’t use these strategies every single day. He’ll be on to you if you do and then it will lose its power. Use his ego whenever it’s </span><span class="calibre17">really</span><span class="calibre3"> important to you that he does something. And remember the golden rule since this one will always work: reinforce good behavior, and ignore bad behavior.</span> </p>
