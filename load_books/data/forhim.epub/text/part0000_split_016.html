<h2 class="calibre39" id="calibre_pb_38"> <a class="calibre15" id="_Toc463016714"><span class="calibre40">The high-value woman slows </span><span class="calibre41">him</span><span class="calibre40"> down</span></a> </h2> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Remember Jamie? She’s the 57-year-old woman who found her knight in shining armor. He asked her to marry her after a couple of months and then ran for the hills a while later, calling off the wedding and disappearing forever.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman knows men cannot handle emotions very well. She knows this probation period is an absolute must for him too! Even when </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> falls head over heels and wants to go fast, even then (especially then!), she paces herself and explains they need to take things slowly. She wants to learn who he is first and give him the time to get to know her well too.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">More importantly, as explained before, she guards her own life and passions. If she would jump on board and allow herself to get drifted away by the passion that a new relationship brings, she will lose herself. It will be way too easy for her to become needy, to put all of her eggs into his basket, and to start depending on him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Unlike him, </span><span class="calibre17">she</span><span class="calibre3"> does think ahead.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Before meeting her prince, the high-value woman had her life pretty well in order. She had her career, hobbies, passions, social activities, habits, etc. She knows she should never ever throw those out right away just because she met a great guy, regardless of how nice, respectful, or affectionate he is toward her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I want to stress this. The high-value woman doesn’t give up on her life to get some attention from the bad boy she met. She doesn’t adapt to his agenda. On the other hand, she won’t adapt to the nicest man in the world who truly loves her either! She doesn’t want to lose her stability, her habits, her life. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Even if she’s dealing with a great guy who clears his entire agenda to be with her as much as he can, she won’t allow him! She has built up her life before him, and she’s adamant about not throwing that away.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is tough.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman is not a robot. She’s human, after all. She can be flooded by feelings and butterflies. Her body might be screaming that she should spend every second with her love interest, especially because he wants it too! He keeps asking her out!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nonetheless, she uses her emotional intelligence and thinks long term. So she limits the early stages to two or three dates per week. She declines the other attempts to get together. She continues her yoga class, her favorite TV show, her evening walks, and most of what was important to her before meeting </span><span class="calibre17">him. </span><span class="calibre3">She consciously decides to not throw her own life overboard, even when all the lights are green and it seems like this guy </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> the one.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Fighting this urge to be with him is not easy. But believe me, it’s way easier than all the heartache that would follow if she’d rush in.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When a man wants to go fast, she controls the rhythm since she doesn’t want him to hurt himself </span><span class="calibre17">and </span><span class="calibre3">her in the process. She knows that when she allows him to run, he will outrun himself, fall down, get scared, and stop seeing her. When she paces him, his fear of commitment won’t surface. </span> </p>
