   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There are different types of men. As I described in my book </span><a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/amazon-dp-action/us/bookshelf.marketplacelink/B00VK68NHK"><span class="calibre12">Red Flags, Signs He’s Playing Games With You</span></a><span class="calibre3">, a lot of men who play games are really bad for you. I’ve described how to spot them in that book. Here, however, I want to focus on the good guys.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What if you’re in a relationship with a guy and he pulls back, or he says he’ll call and then doesn’t, or he is late for a date? Is he playing games? A good guy, even a gentleman, might deliberately pull any of those off indeed. And when he does, it’s a test!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">He’s testing you to see what personality you really have. This is partially the three-year-old kid in him, who just wants to see what he can get away with (it’d better not be too much), but more importantly, he’s trying to see how you will respond.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Just like you probably have had, the men you’ll meet will have had their fair share of bad dates and relationships, possibly even a bad marriage...or two. He may have scars and small to major emotional trauma. This would put up anyone’s guard. That’s why some men, not all, will decide to test you. To see how you will behave, how you will react.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Some of the tests he can deploy are:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">1. Telling you he’ll call, but then he doesn’t </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">2. Being more aloof and thus creating some distance</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">3. “Honestly” telling you that he’s not ready for a relationship</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">4. Falling asleep right after sex. No, I’m kidding, that’s real and not a test. All men have had this reaction, even to the best sex ever…especially to the best sex ever. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When he puts you through any of these tests early on (within the first couple of months of dating), he’ll closely monitor your reactions. Let’s go over the wrong way and the right way for those first three tests mentioned above.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre28"> <span class="calibre3">When he says he’ll call and then doesn’t, some women who finally do get a hold of him will snap at him. When you read between the lines, you’ll notice this woman is clearly communicating he’s very important to her, she has been worrying about when she’d finally get through to him, and now, she’s mad. There’s no challenge for him as a result. He has her. This will reassure </span><span class="calibre17">and</span><span class="calibre3"> scare him at the same time. And that last part is important. Some men test a woman just to see where they stand. But even when they get the confirmation, they’ll get scared. Did I already mention that men are totally illogical when it comes to emotions and romance?</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">The right way to respond is to not care. The high-value woman would not care for real. She has several passion projects, even small things like gardening, walking, reorganizing the plants in her fishbowl. She has so many activities that she doesn’t even sense it when he takes a step back. Even if she does, she thinks, “Well, fine. If he doesn’t like me enough then I’ll find me a guy who does. I deserve nothing less!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">So upon taking his call or seeing him after a period of total silence, she’ll act like nothing has happened. To her, nothing has. He, on the other hand, will not find the reassurance he might have been looking for, which will make him chase her harder. But his alarm bells won’t go off either. He won’t see her as the needy woman every man runs away from. This will make him feel closer to her. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">If you’ve never tested this, please do. Men react like Pavlov’s dog. I know I do. Our emotional wiring isn’t all that complicated. That’s exactly the problem for some women; they try to make it complicated when men are in fact pretty easy to steer once you know how.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="2" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre30"> <span class="calibre3">When he creates distance by disappearing from the radar, some women will chase after him. That’s never a good idea. It will not only turn him off, but more importantly, it lowers their self-respect tremendously. The high-value woman reacts by putting more of her attention into other passions, or even other men she then starts dating, even if this guy still lingers around in her head. (She’s not a robot after all; she does have feelings.) </span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">She knows she’s good enough. If </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> can’t see it, someone else will. She only wants a guy who wants her for who she is. If she has to start chasing him, work out more, lose weight, get a nose job, dye her hair, get rid of her cat or whatever to get him, he’s not the king she wants. And she doesn’t let him know by nagging, she does so by not paying attention to him. The men who are not sufficiently interested will disappear, and that’s great (less time wasted). But the good guys will surprise you. They will start to chase, work out, lose weight, and maybe even </span><span class="calibre17">get</span><span class="calibre3"> a cat just to get into your good graces again. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">I want to repeat again that this is </span><span class="calibre17">not</span><span class="calibre3"> some game to her. She has forced herself to believe that she is enough. And if a certain guy doesn’t see it? NEXT! As I said, most women were not born with this gift. They’ve had to reprogram their own beliefs. They kept repeating it until it became a habit to react that way.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">As I always say, you are the most important person you will ever meet! You’ve been there for you since day one, and you’ll be there for you during your final moments. It’s OK to treat yourself as such, as the important person you are to yourself. I realize this may sound silly or obvious. But if you look into it, you’ll see there surely are some areas in your life where you’re not fully embracing this concept. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">When a woman doesn’t act like she finds herself important, he won’t find her important either.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="3" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre31"> <span class="calibre3">Another test he might deploy is telling you he’s not ready for a relationship. That’s an interesting one! I’ve coached women who had a man say this. Their response? They became needy! He then repeated he really wasn’t ready and didn’t want to lead them on...as he was breaking up with them. Less than a year later, he married his dream girl. I’ve seen this happen to so many women! </span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">It is </span><span class="calibre17">no</span><span class="calibre3"> coincidence. When a man uses that sentence, he’s trying to create some space. What he’s really saying is that he likes her, but he wants to take things slow so he can get comfortable with all of these feelings and emotions that men simply cannot handle well. Mind you, I’m still talking about the good guys here; there are, of course, men who use this phrase to lead women on. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">So how can you know the difference? By responding exactly in the way the high-value woman would. She says, “Sure, take all the time you need. I’m not sure about you either.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre29"> <span class="calibre3">The man then thinks, “Say what? You’re not sure? Why not?” This will intrigue him and make him want her more. I repeat, men are not all that complicated.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here’s the rule. While staying kind and respectful, the more you ignore him or make it not important where “this” goes, the more he will want you! The more he will want “this” to go somewhere. You can think this is silly, childish, and absolutely ridiculous (it is). But this is reality. When does a three-year-old boy seek the attention of his mommy? When she’s paying attention to something or someone else, when she’s ignoring him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Adult men are no different.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If he has feelings for you, then the less important you think he is, the more important he will believe you to be. The high-value woman draws in men like moths to a flame because she will never find him or the relationship </span><span class="calibre17">as</span><span class="calibre3"> important as he does. When you study her and the way she acts in relationships, you’ll see that he’s always one step ahead when it comes to how important the relationship is.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s look at these scenarios. On a scale from one to ten, here’s how important the relationship is to:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Man: 6, Woman: 10 &gt; The man will get suffocated and will run.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Woman: 6, Man: 10 &gt; It will take longer, but the woman will start to see her guy as her friend/brother. Although she might not run, she’ll soon discover she’s attracted to other men.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Am I right? When you look at your past relationships or those of people you know, you’ll see this dynamic to be true. She/he who </span><span class="calibre17">needs </span><span class="calibre3">the relationship the most doesn’t have the lead. However, he/she who </span><span class="calibre17">needs</span><span class="calibre3"> the relationship the least will perpetually keep attracting the other party.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I deliberately use the word need instead of want. It’s OK to want a relationship; most of us do. But the person who needs a relationship will always have the weaker position simply because he/she has the most to lose.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s easy to act needy, to overcompensate, to seek approval, to accept bad behavior, and to make any of the other mistakes if you really </span><span class="calibre17">need</span><span class="calibre3"> the relationship. That’s what the high-value woman does so well. She wants the man she’s with. He </span><span class="calibre17">needs</span><span class="calibre3"> the woman he’s with. She gets him hooked because of her behavior. And you can take this literally. She creates some form of an addiction where he just couldn’t imagine his life without her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">To get there, she does many little things that I will describe throughout this book, but it always comes down to these three traits:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre3">She’s a queen. She believes she is high value, regardless of what anyone else thinks. She has a lot of self-respect.</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="2" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre33"> <span class="calibre3">He’s not the epicenter of her life. She loves him dearly, but her life never revolves around him. He can come along for the ride, or they can both go for a ride and decide what destination to head to, but she’s never in the passenger seat.</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="3" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre34"> <span class="calibre3">She never ever pursues him. If he seems to lose interest, she withdraws. She has better things to do. She loves being in a relationship, but she doesn’t need it to be happy and fulfilled. </span> </li> 
   </ol>
