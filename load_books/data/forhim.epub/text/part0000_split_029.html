   <h1 class="calibre51"> <a class="calibre15" id="_Toc463016728"><span class="calibre16">matters most to him</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Do you know what men want most from their girlfriend or wife? What, above everything else, is most important to them? Please think about the answer for a second, before you continue reading.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">They want to feel like a man, not like a pussy or a wussy. All men have ever done since the age of ten is try to matter. This means trying to make sure to not be picked last in gym class when teams had to be formed. Trying to get girls. Trying to achieve. Trying to become someone. Men always try to matter. All great men have this built into their genes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">As they get older, this masculinity starts to evolve in a strong will to provide and protect. Simply put, most men want to build a nest, find a great wife who wouldn’t mind living in that nest, make babies with her, care for her, provide, and protect. I start to see more and more men who don’t want the baby part, but what </span><span class="calibre17">all</span><span class="calibre3"> great men have in common is that they want to care for you. This is interesting because this means if you meet a guy who’s seemingly not into caring for you, he’s either not a great guy or not sufficiently interested in you. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A great way to keep a guy is to not only keep his masculinity intact but to also help him build it even stronger. This is something the high-value woman understands very well. She will give him what he needs. Not because she wants to manipulate him, but because she loves him so much she wants him to be all that he can be. He will do the same for her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men are attracted to your femininity. That’s exactly what triggers their will to protect and provide for you. Sure, we live in a day and age where you no longer </span><span class="calibre17">need</span><span class="calibre3"> it, but let him protect and care. He needs it more than you do.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What this means to him will be different for every guy you’ll meet. There’s no standard. What you’ll most often see is that if you talk about any problem you face, he’ll try to fix it for you. That’s his way of caring and protecting. Some women don’t like it when their guy tries to help. That’s a mistake. It’s best to let him take care of at least some of your challenges and problems.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nonetheless, he’s also going to do things that seemingly have nothing to do with you. He wants to show off and make you proud of him (by getting a raise, launching a new business, or achieving any other goal). This is a critical one. I’ve coached far too many women who failed to recognize how important these were to their guy. Remember how I explained that most men remain the three-year-old kid version of themselves to some degree? That part wants to get praise from the most important female in his life. This used to be mommy, now it’s you. He will come home from work and explain how he successfully completed a certain task, gave a presentation, or achieved just about anything. Please listen to him and praise him for it. Even though you don’t get what all the fuss is about. Just like a cat can bring home something it caught to make you proud, men will do the same. They might bring something home you don’t need or care about at all. Still, they did it for you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And that’s exactly why it’s so critical. You might think, “Well yes, that doesn’t matter to me. I don’t want him to work harder and earn more money. I’d rather have him spend more time with me.” Although it doesn’t look like it on the surface, he’s still doing it for you. He will provide and protect in any way he sees fit. Please let him. He needs it to feel masculine.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is a two-way street. He only deserves your praise and attention as long as he’s giving you what you need. He will most often give back by committing more and more to you and openly showing his affection and love. I want to be clear, you should not support a guy who fails to show up for dates because of work, or a guy who disrespects you in any way. I’m talking about the good guy, who loves you, is affectionate, </span><span class="calibre17">and </span><span class="calibre3">works hard on his career in order to provide for you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is a positive vicious cycle. The more he can feel masculine around your feminine energy, the more he’ll start to get addicted to you and the more he’ll want to stay forever. He wants to matter to the woman he loves.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’ve got a pretty poignant example of this. Dr. Mark K. Goldstein, a psychologist, did clinical research on the conditioning of husbands by their wives. He especially focused on angry and neglected wives. Here’s what he wanted to find out: “Is there anything we’ve learned throughout years of research on how to influence </span><span class="calibre17">all</span><span class="calibre3"> types of living organisms from as little as bacteria to as large as humans that we can test and apply on bad and sometimes even brutal husbands? Could we influence their behavior?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Before the test on these husbands took place, research had shown that the best way to influence the behavior of anything that’s alive is to reward the desired behavior instead of punishing the bad and undesired behavior. I’ve already discussed that earlier in this book. Punishment seems to work in the short term, but never does in the long term because resentment or at the very least indifference starts to appear. They had already tested this on pigeons and other animals, now it was time to test it on...men. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">For this experiment, Dr. Goldstein sought out wives who had ordinary marital conflicts—nothing special. What all of these wives had in common, however, was that they kept focusing their attention on the undesirable behavior by either trying to punish it (nagging, complaining, fighting) or worse by rewarding the bad behavior by trying even harder to please their husbands. Both methods always backfired in the long run. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">One wife in particular, let’s call her Sabrina, presented an interesting case. After years of being in an unhappy marriage, Sabrina’s husband finally left her...to move in with his new girlfriend. Interestingly enough, he kept calling Sabrina every now and then to see how she was. So he clearly still had somewhat of an interest in her. This is obviously crucial.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Now the question was, could Sabrina, for the sake of this experiment, influence the behavior of her ex-husband after he had already left her? Her strategy was to be different compared to what she had tried during the marriage. She would reward good behavior and stay indifferent to bad behavior.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Her first goal was to see if she could increase the frequency of his calls to her. Sabrina never called him; she was always on the receiving end. When he did call, she was very affectionate and positive. She complimented the things she </span><span class="calibre17">did</span><span class="calibre3"> like about him (by encouraging him, complimenting him, praising him) and neglected what she didn’t like (e.g., the fact that he left her after many years of marriage to move in with a new girlfriend). Sabrina meticulously recorded everything that happened—when he called, for how long, what they talked about, and more.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">She was never critical, hostile, or negative, and she also always made sure that </span><span class="calibre17">she</span><span class="calibre3"> was the one ending the calls. It didn’t take long before the frequency of the phone calls increased significantly. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">One day, he arrived at her house and stood at her door. Following the plan of the experiment, Sabrina said, “I’m so glad you’re here. I have a fresh, imported Cuban cigar for you in the freezer, just the kind you like.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Sabrina continued to reinforce his good behavior (everything she liked) and paid no attention to the negative behavior. That very negative behavior, like his indifference, melted away automatically, and it didn’t take long before he left his new girlfriend and asked if he could move back in. This is a prime example of how much power you have over men as a woman, if you play your cards right.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Reinforce the positive behavior. Don’t give any (negative) attention to the bad behavior. If he shows bad behavior, lower your attention and withdraw. If he shows too much bad behavior to your liking, kick him to the curb.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Furthermore, this experiment proves how important it is to any man to be encouraged and praised by his girlfriend or wife. That’s what attracts him the most!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Before I end this chapter, here’s an important remark. Your female tenderness, praise, and devotion should be earned. If you start to compliment and praise him too soon, it will reek of desperation.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What I discussed in this chapter should only kick in when you are in an exclusive, committed relationship with your great guy who has been affectionate. It also helps to recuperate a relationship that started to go bad, but I wouldn’t use it on a man who has shown a lack of interest from the get-go.  </span> </p>
