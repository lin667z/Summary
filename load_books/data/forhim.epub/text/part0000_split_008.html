<h1 class="calibre14" id="calibre_pb_22"> <a class="calibre15" id="_Toc463016706"><span class="calibre16">Your most powerful weapon</span></a> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You have one very powerful weapon toward men. Your looks.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s what you expected me to say, right?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s wrong. Your looks don’t matter nearly as much as you think. There are plenty of gorgeous women with a love life from hell. While there are several normal-looking women married to great guys who adore them. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Having great looks only gets your foot in the door. Men use your looks to decide whether they will walk up to you or not. But they do not want to marry your looks, move in with your looks, make babies with your looks. No, no. They want </span><span class="calibre17">you</span><span class="calibre3">, the whole package.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Truth be told, I’ve seen girlfriends of mine become gorgeous when I got to know them better. Truly. If I had to be blunt and score them on their looks, I would have given them a 6 or a 7 on a scale from 1 to 10. When I was dating them and got to know their great personalities, however, they quickly rose to a 10 or above.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I want to emphasize that love makes men blind as well! These women actually became gorgeous in my eyes. If I were to be at a networking party full of models and actresses, I would still have thought my girlfriend to be the most gorgeous and attractive one. That’s because she was, to me.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Something magical happens when you show a man the real you. Not the part of you that might want to seek approval, be needy, or nag. That’s never the real you; that’s just an insecure part of yourself. All of this is tricky. If this were easy, no woman would have a problem holding onto that great guy she likes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">One of the major problems is most women have been led to believe that all men want is sex. You’ve probably read eye-catching claims like, “Men think about sex every six seconds” or “Get a sexy stomach in no time flat” and “Inject nasty stuff into your lips so you’ll start looking like a sex doll!” These are taught to women from an early age by the magazines that scream what women should be doing to be lovable.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Some women sadly never understand that all these magazines want to do is sell more magazines. The editors don’t care about your love life or about you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here’s the cold, hard truth:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Men have a huge drive to make babies. Not to be a daddy, change diapers, play happy family. They merely want to have sex and make babies. It’s in their instincts. They want to spread their genes and reproduce. They have been programmed to. For this, men do not, I repeat, </span><span class="calibre17">do not</span><span class="calibre3"> think about sex all the time! Yet, a lot of what they do is to get sex indeed!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Allow me to explain as we dive deeper inside the male mind. What I’m about to share has been scientifically researched by Geoffrey Miller, author of </span><span class="calibre17">The Mating Mind </span><span class="calibre3">and</span><span class="calibre17"> Spent</span><span class="calibre3">. He found out that almost everything men do is to get sex.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When men chase money or success, they do this to be able to get a great woman. When men buy a Porsche, they want to be important and attract women. Sure, we all know how you’d fall right away for a guy who steps out of a Porsche...right? Men are so primitive and silly sometimes. Almost everything they buy is to attract the right women. If we look at it like this, men indirectly think about sex </span><span class="calibre17">every </span><span class="calibre3">single second of their day. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And yet, sex is not </span><span class="calibre17">that </span><span class="calibre3">important to him. When a man hasn’t had sex for a while, hormones start to build in his body; his urge will get bigger and bigger. Until he gets sex or pleases himself by watching porn or by simply using his imagination.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If having sex with an actual woman were the only way to release that urge, to take the steam out of the kettle, bad things would start to happen in the world. Luckily, men have other ways to clean the pipes. And that’s what sex is.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When he has sex with </span><span class="calibre17">you</span><span class="calibre3">, however, it’s supposed to be a lot more than just helping him get rid of his urge. It should be, and it can be. But it’s up to you to decide! If you give him sex too soon, it will be just about sex. You won’t be anything more than all of the other women he’s only had sex with. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If, however, you make him wait for it, you can build up your value a lot. It’s the best way to quickly put you into the category with high-value women. I already explained that men will test you and try to define your personality by looking at your behavior. Holding out on sex is very strong behavior. And it’s good for you, too! It’s the best way to weed out some of the game players just looking for one-night stands or friends with benefits. You’ll never have those guys just for yourself, so it’s best to filter them out quickly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What’s interesting though is that men will decide what category they put you in (one-night stand versus relationship material) long before they’ve had sex with you. So besides not having sex too soon (definitely not the first 3-4 dates), try to steer clear of the following:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Do not use your body to lure him. Don’t hide it, but don’t use it either. Make him wonder. There’s a reason why strippers don’t walk up to the stage already naked. They are well dressed and then take their clothes off one piece at a time, very slowly. This builds the anticipation. The visual aspect is important too. Men are much more visual than women when it comes to arousal. You know this. But this doesn’t mean a woman should show everything. His imagination is visual, too. Give him visual hints, without showing the goods. A man will find it a lot sexier if you wear a shirt or sweater that somewhat shows the shape of your breasts than  walking around bare-breasted. Even showing cleavage too soon is not a good idea. Show him shapes, not the actual body part.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Here’s another trick you can use. I’ll never forget when I was about 14 years old, full on in my puberty and hornier than a bull. I had a young and pretty math teacher. She was always well dressed and took care of her appearance. One day she had been sitting at her desk as we completed an assignment. She was wearing a classy skirt and shirt, with her hair in a ponytail. Then she dropped a pen and bent over to pick it up. For a split second I could look up her shirt that was loosely hanging down. I saw her bra. This drove me nuts. My hormones went berserk for the very first time ever. This was also the very first time I had felt one of the powers a woman can have over a guy. She gave me a hint. My mind couldn’t stop thinking about the complete picture. Had she given me the complete picture by standing totally naked in front of the blackboard, I would not have been thinking about her in that way for months. To be honest, even thinking about that moment now, more than twenty years later, still does something to me. There are many ways you can give him a hint. However, it should be inconspicuous. If he realizes you’re doing it on purpose, it will lose ALL of its power. All of it! It devalues you right away to the one-night-stand category. Trying (too) hard never works well on a man. Please remember they always want what they cannot get (right away) or that for which they have to work hard. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So here are some great examples of hints:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Hang/put something sexy of you somewhere in your home where he can see it. Make sure it’s the usual place for that item to not make it obvious. An example is hanging one of your sexy bras on the back of your bathroom door. Placing some sexy shoes where he will take his shoes off. He will then start to visualize you wearing that item. Always build up the anticipation first.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">When it’s time to say goodnight after the first or the second and even the third date, he might invite you over. If he’s audacious, he’ll invite himself in either directly or with a ruse. Even though your entire body might be screaming to have sex with him then and there, don’t. You can say, “I’m not ready for this yet. You’ll need to pass a couple more tests first” with a big smile. This is flirty, playful, and will allow him to build up the anticipation and chase you harder. Most importantly, it will give you the time to really gauge his personality before being blinded by the oxytocin rush after having had sex with him. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Wear something that shows your sexy shapes, without showing too much skin (or any skin at all). Keep him guessing.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Women who are overtly sexual aren’t sexy at all. Trying to be sexy never ever </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> sexy. It’s perceived as weakness by most men. Sure, they might still be attracted to it, but it will only stand for one night.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Holding off is always a good idea because it will increase the price of the reward. Guess for which woman he will continue to put his best foot in? The woman who gives him great sex every day, or the woman who he can conquer once or twice a week? The harder it is to get something, the more he will appreciate it. It also seriously increases your value since he’ll know you don’t sleep around.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Speaking of sleeping around, when you sleep with a guy too soon, he’ll immediately think you do that with </span><span class="calibre17">all</span><span class="calibre3"> men you meet. Even though he might truly be the exception and you clearly say so, he won’t think so. No man wants to be with a woman he believes all men can get. It has no value to him, no matter how good she looks. It will feel good during sex, but he’ll start to have second thoughts the very millisecond his orgasm is over. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’ll never forget what happened to a great friend of mine, John. He’s an average-looking guy with a balding head. We were at a networking event filled with interesting people. He started to chat with a truly gorgeous woman. He gets her phone number, calls her the next day, and asks her out for Friday that same week. She says yes, they have a great date, and she sleeps with him right away. That Sunday, we go to the gym to work out. He tells me he’s not sure he wants to continue seeing her. I ask him why. His exact words were, “I don’t know. I don’t really </span><span class="calibre17">know</span><span class="calibre3"> her, but I’m already bored of her.” I asked, “Was the sex not great? I mean, she looked gorgeous.” He immediately responded, “Sure! The sex was awesome. She’s really hot, and she was open to anything I wanted. Anything.” </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I already knew what was going on, why he disliked her, but I dug a little deeper. “And you don’t want more of </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3">?” I asked. “Sure, if I don’t meet anyone better, I might hook up with her again,” he admitted. “But you know, now that it was </span><span class="calibre17">this</span><span class="calibre3"> easy to get a girl that good looking. Who knows who I can score? I can reach higher than this!”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Yes...I warned you I was going to give you the cold, hard truth. This is what’s going on in the deep, dark caves of the male mind. The more successful a guy is, the more he’ll want to go to the next level once he has completed the mission at the current level. In every aspect of his life. That’s exactly why it’s so crucial that he cannot get a woman too soon, and that he never fully gets her at all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The harder you make it on him (without using any negativity—no nagging or complaining), the more he’ll want you. The high-value woman uses this power sparingly of course; she doesn’t want to make his life a living hell where he’s continuously wondering where he stands with her either. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Before we dive into the next chapter, I want to point out a major mistake that you should avoid.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The hints I discussed should remain hints, nothing more. There’s nothing more frustrating to a guy than getting cozy with a woman, starting to make out, hoping that </span><span class="calibre17">it</span><span class="calibre3"> will happen, seeing her get all steamy and hot herself, having her remove his shirt or her blouse or whatever other sign that makes it clear that the birds are about to start chirping, only to have the woman then say, “Stop. I’m not ready yet” or “Stop. I forgot I have to get up early tomorrow” or anything to the same tune that means the fun is over. Try taking a sweet lollipop away from a three-year-old, and you’ll see the exact same reaction.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It will be a very bad reaction, emotionally. If your hints are too strong and you allow him to take off like a rocket only to shoot him down minutes later, it will be </span><span class="calibre17">so</span><span class="calibre3"> frustrating to him that he’ll link this negative experience to you. If this happens twice, </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> won’t be in the mood again next time. He’ll be out looking for someone else. He’ll prefer not getting anything than feeling </span><span class="calibre17">this</span><span class="calibre3"> again. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When you make his rocket take off, you should always let it reach the moon before it has to return back to earth. That’s why it’s better to not have any of the first 3-4 dates ending up at your place or his. It’s best that your hint’ come from things he can see, not your words or actions since those can be misinterpreted. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If he sees your bra hanging on your bathroom door, he’s going to get aroused without thinking that you lead him on. If you let him kiss you passionately, allow him to open your blouse, touch your breasts, and only </span><span class="calibre17">then </span><span class="calibre3">stop him in his tracks, he’ll think you lead him on. You’ll lose points. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is why I always advise my clients to not make any sexual innuendos, to not give any sexual hints. Keep the boat off. And don’t let him look in the playbook. Don’t say, “I don’t have sex before the fourth date.” This would again take all of the mystery away and who knows, you might not feel ready during the fourth date. You are in the driver’s seat here. You’ll be ready when you’re ready (just not before the third or fourth date, really), and he’ll see it when the moment comes. That could be the moment where he has cooked a great meal for you, given you a couple of nice compliments, and has proven to be a good guy. As you’re having a conversation in your or his living room, you turn on some music, get up, and ask him to dance. If he does, even though he’s a terrible dancer, you hold him close and gently press your breasts against his chest. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">As soon as you see he’s heating up and getting aroused, you excuse yourself and go to the bathroom where you freshen up a bit. When you return, you unbutton one button of your shirt (only then, in his presence) you start making out and let it go from there. You then let </span><span class="calibre17">him</span><span class="calibre3"> take the lead (he wants to think he’s in the lead), but we both know you were in control at all times. He’s only getting you because he deserved it, because you’re ready. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If you’re in a relationship with him, when you’re in the mood, go for it. When you’re not, don’t do him any favors. Sex needs to be earned, and sex needs to be enjoyed by the both of you at all times. Please don’t think he’s going to run away if you don’t give him enough sex. The men who do were game players; they were not in it for the long haul, and you’re better off without them.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men have plenty of ways to get sex. They can find a one-night stand, they can pay for it, they can go get a massage with a weird ending... Great guys love sex, but they </span><span class="calibre17">love</span><span class="calibre3"> making love even more. That’s harder to get. The guy who sticks with you for the long term will be all about making love to you. And that’s a totally different thing compared to just sex. Men who want to make love to you will wait. They know it’s precious.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">When a man wants to have sex with you soon, this can be a test too!</span><span class="calibre3"> Here’s another secret about men. Most guys are ready to have sex with you the very second they think you are attractive. A five-minute conversation is all most men will need. Some won’t even need a conversation at all. A lot of men will try to have sex with you after the first, second, and third date. They’ll invite you in, invite themselves in, make sexual innuendos, and use a myriad of strategies to get into your pants. So that must mean they really want you to have sex with them, right?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Wrong.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This can very well be a test! They want to see how quickly you will bend over...figuratively. They want you to say no. Because if and when you do, you’ve just proven to them you don’t sleep around, that it will be a challenge to share the bed sheets with you, and that it will eventually be an honor when you decide </span><span class="calibre17">they</span><span class="calibre3"> are good enough to get you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Sex is your most powerful weapon. Use it sparingly and wisely.</span> </p>
