   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Players, narcissists, bad boys, manipulators, douchebags, losers...all seek out women who are weak. Women they </span><span class="calibre17">can</span><span class="calibre3"> play and manipulate.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Many of the women I coach ask, “Why do I always attract jerks?” Every woman attracts jerks! The difference is high-quality women don’t stay with a jerk; they don’t keep dating him. So there’s nothing wrong with you attracting jerks. You’re an attractive woman, so you’ll attract all kinds of men! A hot flame attracts butterflies too, not just moths. The question is, who are the men you’ll keep around?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Weak women—to be absolutely clear, I don’t consider you one of them since weak women don’t read books like these to learn and improve their skills—are needy and accept bad behavior because they believe that’s all they can get. “It’s better than being alone,” they figure. All types of bad men prey on that very belief. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Players and bad men will base themselves on their first impression of you. And great guys will obviously also be attracted because of the first impression. Your first impression on men is built up on two stages:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre3">Your looks</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3">Men are attracted to good-looking women. So it’s normal that you’d spend at least some time making sure you’ll make the right impression in the looks department.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3">That said, the man you’re in a long-term relationship with will eventually get used to your looks. Plus, there are plenty of other pretty women out there. Women who only use their looks to get men find it harder to differentiate themselves from other women and cannot prevent men from becoming indifferent after a couple of weeks, months, or years. There’s always a prettier and younger version out there. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3">Your personality, the way you make him feel, </span><span class="calibre17">that’s</span><span class="calibre3"> the true differentiator! That’s what makes you unique. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol start="2" class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre33"> <span class="calibre3">Your personality. </span><span class="calibre18">This is the most important part.</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3">Most women spend the least amount of attention on this part of a first impression. They spend a lot of time wondering “how do I look?” and less time on “how do I act?” This is where the high-value woman makes the difference. She understands her personality is her main differentiator. That’s why you’ll see many average- or even bad-looking high-value women with great guys who adore them. Great guys know they need to look far beyond your looks. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Just like high-quality men are in short supply, so are high-value women. I’m sure you’ve seen this in social gatherings. The more you act and behave like a high-value woman, your power of choice increases. Not just romantically. High-value women get better jobs, higher salaries, better everything.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When you first meet a guy, he has already noticed your looks a long time before. Your personality, however, is something he’ll start to base upon your behavior and on what you say (and don’t say). I’ve discussed what not to do in my other books like </span><a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/amazon-dp-action/us/bookshelf.marketplacelink/B00LEFHO9A"><span class="calibre12">Are You Scaring Him Away?</span></a><span class="calibre3"> and </span><a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/amazon-dp-action/us/bookshelf.marketplacelink/B015M2FDRK"><span class="calibre12">21 Traps</span></a><span class="calibre3">. Here I’ll discuss what </span><span class="calibre17">to</span><span class="calibre3"> do and how the high-value woman handles it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’m sure I’m not the first person to tell you how important first impressions are. They really are! We all suffer from some kind of cognitive filter in our brain that sticks to the first image we get. That’s a cognitive distortion often called the first impression bias. As soon as we have created our first impression we set it in stone and start filtering out everything that proves our impression was right. All of the evidence against our first impression is automatically discarded.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Our brains do this to save energy. Since our brains use up a ton of energy, they have a lot of shortcuts to avoid using processing power whenever it’s not necessary. When you see a car, your brain doesn’t look back at that car to second-guess whether you were right or not. If it looks like a car, it </span><span class="calibre17">is </span><span class="calibre3">a car. We can make misjudgments because of this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Did you ever meet someone at work who made a bad first impression? This person said or did something that you did not like at all. Your first impression has been created. Then, days or even weeks later you enter a meeting room and guess who sits at the meeting table? </span><span class="calibre17">That</span><span class="calibre3"> person. Your mind will immediately come up with the bad feeling that has been linked to that specific person, and this will strongly influence how you will respond to that person. A wasp only needed to sting you once for you to never ever forget those nasty little creatures are not to be trusted.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So this is a cognitive distortion we all have and need. If you’re ever walking around in the jungle and you see a tiger in front of you, your feelings of danger will start to increase right away. You won’t get the time to second-guess your first impression and think, “Well, he looks cute and not so hungry...he resembles that tiger from Winnie the Pooh and that was a kind tiger. Will this one be kind too? Should I check it out?” This type of thinking would obviously get you injured or worse, killed. Long story short, our minds tend to stick to our first impression. This is yet another primal instinct.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This has both negative and positive consequences. If you mess up the first impression, you can virtually forget it. It will take a long time to reset it. On the other hand, if you make a great first impression, you have a lot of room to drop the ball here and there afterwards. Here, too, it will take a long time before the first impression will change. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s why you’ll need to work hard on the first impression you make, especially on men. Men decide within the first couple of minutes whether they see you as long-term girlfriend or wife material. When a woman makes the wrong first impression, you’ll see that her boyfriend needs a lot more time before he’s able to commit. That’s because he wants to wait and see which way the wind blows. He needs time to prove his first impression wrong (men with real commitment issues aside).</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here are some strategies that will help you make a good first impression.</span> </p>
