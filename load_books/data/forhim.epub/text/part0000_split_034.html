   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’ve already touched on this subject before, but let’s get into the nitty gritty. How would the high-value woman respond to a guy saying, “I’m not ready for a relationship?” </span><span class="calibre17">if</span><span class="calibre3"> it’s actually a great guy saying this? A guy she’d love to continue on with?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre53"> <span class="calibre3">She dumps </span><span class="calibre17">him.</span> </li> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre54"> <span class="calibre3">She gets mad.</span> </li> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre55"> <span class="calibre3">She tries to </span><span class="calibre17">sell</span><span class="calibre3"> him on the idea of giving it a try.</span> </li> 
    <li value="4" class="calibre56"> <span class="calibre3">She starts to put in a bigger effort to increase his attraction.</span> </li> 
    <li value="5" class="calibre57"> <span class="calibre3">None of the above</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre17"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Please think about the answer for a second, before you continue.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Option 1 would be the correct answer if this guy would have given her any red flags, but that’s not the case here. This </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> a great guy, who simply seems scared or not ready to commit for any or no reason at all.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The correct answer is obviously not getting mad or trying to put in a bigger effort to increase his attention since this would only lower her value. It’s not trying to sell him on the idea of giving it a try. This too would lower her value and, on top of this, make him withdraw. Can you see why?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We all love to buy, but we hate to be sold. If something needs to be sold upon us, our defense system kicks in and we start to wonder what’s wrong with it. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So the correct answer was 5, none of the above.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here’s what the high-value woman would say: “If that’s how you feel then I believe we should indeed stop seeing each other. I deserve a guy who’s all in. You should take your time to figure out what you want and go have some fun. The fun you seem to be wanting. The fun a real committed relationship might exclude. So go ahead. And if we’re meant to be, we might still get back together if I’m not in a committed relationship with another guy by that time.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is a sneaky and powerful strategy. He has his doubts. She’s not selling him on anything. On the contrary, she’s reacting in the last way he would have ever expected. She’s giving him the freedom he believes he needs right away, but there’s one caveat. She adds, “If I’m not in a committed relationship with another guy by that time.” This immediately triggers the “Indeed, what if she </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3">?” response in him. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is a strong response. It shows a ton of self-love and self-respect. It communicates, “Hey, I’m not going to try to keep someone around who doesn’t want to keep me. I’ll find someone else.” But it’s also loving since it says, “I care about you being happy. I appreciate you enough to not be selfish and give you what you requested” (even though I then decide to not be a part of it). And on top of that, it’s a strong sign of self-respect: “I deserve someone who’s all in.” If that’s not you, then I’ll find someone who is. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Is this easy?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">No, not at all. Your intuition will try to push you to plead, sell, nag, or feel frustrated. The high-value woman feels this too, and it’s exactly because she moves past that and shows a ton of emotional intelligence that she indeed shows what enormous amounts of value she has. She clearly </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> a high-value woman. And only dumb guys will fail to notice this. The guys you wouldn’t want anyway. Great men cannot help but feel respect for this type of woman. </span> </p>
