   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">To put it bluntly, men look for sex; women look for commitment. That’s what we’ve been programmed to do, straight out of the box. This, of course, doesn’t mean men don’t need commitment and women don’t need sex. But if we’d look at the primary motivators, these would be it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Commitment will never be as high on his list as it will be on yours. So there will be a point where you can’t help but wonder, “Is he as invested in our relationship as I am? Does he really love me? Is he really in it for the long term?” Your mind will start to look for signs and clues to get an answer. That’s dangerous since these thoughts originate from a fear that, once passed onto the guy, will make him run. That’s what I’ve described in detail in my book </span><a href="https://kdp.amazon.com/amazon-dp-action/us/bookshelf.marketplacelink/B00LEFHO9A"><span class="calibre12">Are You Scaring Him Away?</span></a><span class="calibre3"> The sooner he’ll sense this anxiety, the harder he will run. The more you force him to keep confirming he’s in it for the long run, the more you are actually forcing him to question it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">High-value women have the same doubts in the back of their minds, but this is when their emotional intelligence kicks in. They don’t act upon every negative emotion like fear or insecurity; they feel and they think about the long-term consequences of their actions. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Continuously seeking proof of his love and trying to take away the insecurity that every relationship comes with will eventually push every guy away (and great guys sooner than later). </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">High-value women know this Holy Grail doesn’t exist. The security most women look for does not exist. Any man can at any time decide he wants to bolt from the relationship. So can you. And this is exactly one of the many reasons why she’s so attractive to high-quality men. They love her emotional strength. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let me be vulnerable here. I’m a guy who suffers from a fear to commit. I’ve had a horrible childhood where my mother was yelling at my dad every day, telling him things like “Sleeping next to you every night makes me sick.” Yet, my dad kept enduring this, for over ten years, until my mom finally called it quits. I made a promise to myself to never ever fall into the trap my dad had fallen into. I had a difficult time trusting women; this was one of my limiting beliefs instilled upon me during my childhood.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Whenever a relationship became a bit too serious, I started to withdraw automatically. Most women I dated did the wrong thing; they started to push me even more. That’s the last thing you need to do with a guy who has real commitment issues.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">My current long-term girlfriend of four years dealt with it in a different way: the high-value way. Here’s exactly what happened. We had been dating for two months, and the relationship started to get serious. One night, right before going to bed—she had been staying over at my place the last couple of days—she said something simple that triggered my commitment alarm. I forgot what it was.</span><span class="calibre17"> </span><span class="calibre3">She could sense I was withdrawing and becoming distant. Instead of saying, “Is everything all right? Do you still love me? Are you still serious about us?” or any of those pushy sentences, she said, “Would you like me to leave and stay at my own place?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Wow. This got me thinking and snapped me right out of my commitment fear. “No, no. I have some commitment issues, but no, I want you to stay” is how I responded. She used the same response as we were packing up her stuff to move in with me, as I’ve already explained earlier.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Her self-confidence made me more attracted to her than ever. It raised her value significantly. She was not desperate or needy; she wouldn’t ever get clingy. That’s what her response communicated to me. She had options. If our relationship wouldn’t work out for any reason or another, she would bump right back up and go on with her life. This is what attracted me. Can you see why? It’s the exact opposite of the neediness men fear so much. All men, not just those with real commitment issues like myself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Quick note about a man’s fear to commit. I have had real issues with commitment. But a ton of guys and players just bring it up so they can keep playing with other women too.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If a man brings up the fact that he’s not ready for a relationship early on and his actions are not proving his willingness to keep moving forward with you, he’s not lying. Believe him and move on. He won’t change. You’re not the right girl for him. If you continue with a guy like that, you’ll have to continue fighting a fight you cannot win. </span> </p>
