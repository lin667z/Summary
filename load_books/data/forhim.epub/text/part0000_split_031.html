   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is a tough subject because we obviously all need to make sacrifices in a relationship. Where do you draw the line then? Before I dig into what the high-value woman would do, let’s first look at what </span><span class="calibre17">not </span><span class="calibre3">to do.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Many people are brought up as a so-called Nice Guy or Nice Girl. They believe if they are good to the world and anyone in it, the world will be good to them too. Needless to say, that’s not how the world works. So these well-meaning people are often left frustrated and feeling helpless.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Question is, are they </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3"> well-meaning?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It turns out they are not. Dr. Robert Glover, a psychologist, has studied the behaviors of Nice Guys for a very long time, and he concludes that Nice Guys are actually not that </span><span class="calibre17">nice.</span><span class="calibre3"> They manipulate the women they are with. They try to </span><span class="calibre17">get</span><span class="calibre3"> something from them (affection, sex, love) by being nice to them. They’re not just nice to be nice; they want something in return.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Have you ever been with someone like that? Most women I’ve met, coached, or interviewed wholeheartedly confirm that being in a relationship with this type of guy feels very suffocating, as if he always wants something from you that you cannot give. Some of these women even asked their then boyfriend to “grow a pair” or to get a backbone.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This backbone is important. The nice people I talk about in this chapter allow people to walk all over them, often not only in their romantic relationships. They have a hard time saying no; they quickly get a feeling of guilt when they have to disappoint someone, and because of this, they are easily played by others. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Did you ever try to get more attention from someone (especially from a man) by being extra nice to him? If so, this chapter applies to you. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nice guys and nice girls continuously emit signals that they are low value. They keep adapting their behavior, seek the approval of others, and let other people walk over them. No one, women or men, likes that in a romantic relationship unless they are the type who loves whips, chains, and dungeons.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You can be nice nevertheless. High-value men and women are nice, but they will always enforce their boundaries and when someone tries to walk over them. They’ll be assertive (still in a kind way) and say no.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Tabitha, one of the women I coached, had a hard time applying this. She had an aversion for fights and discussions. Growing up, her dad had always been very strict and demanding. She tried to be a good girl to get his attention and kept that behavior as she became older and started dating men. These men, even the good guys, walked all over her because she let them. When Harvey, the boyfriend she was with when I coached her, did something she disliked, she never mentioned it. She got mad inside, but in order to not lose his praise and to steer clear of any fights, she neglected to be assertive. Every now and then, it would get too much for her and then she would explode and start yelling. Harvey didn’t get where all of </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3"> was coming from, of course. Tabitha had to learn how to be assertive and immediately state what was important to her, instead of letting it build up.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s what she started to do. She had reached out to me the moment where it was almost too late. Harvey had already told her he thought it would be a good idea for them to start seeing other people. I asked her to be much more assertive and state clearly what she wanted, without pointing the blame. That’s what assertion is all about.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“I don’t like it when you, because...”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Instead of “Why do you never...” or “Why did you...” That’s pointing the finger and a sign of aggression. Assertiveness is all about “I,” not showing what the other person did wrong.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">As Tabitha started to apply this, the attraction (both the physical and emotional type) of Harvey started to rise again. Men love high-value women who assertively state their rules without getting mad, nagging, or any of the bad ways of communicating your needs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ll always need to make sacrifices in any relationship; he will have to as well. But you can never forgo what is truly dear to you. If you have to then he’s not the </span><span class="calibre17">right</span><span class="calibre3"> guy for you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This too is where high-value women make the difference. They think ahead. They know that if they would adapt or change in order to please their guy or make him stay, </span><span class="calibre17">they</span><span class="calibre3"> themselves will eventually become deeply unhappy. That’s never on their agenda. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Pick your battles. If a change is easy to make and you wouldn’t mind making this change for the rest of your life, go ahead and make the sacrifice. If you feel a ton of resistance coming from the core of who you are, it’s better to not make that big of a sacrifice because you’ll start to resent him. Assertively state what’s important to you. If </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3">’s then unable to adapt, he might be a great guy, but he’s not the </span><span class="calibre17">right</span><span class="calibre3"> guy for you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is often a tough nut to crack, and that’s exactly where high-value women keep making the difference. Stepping out of a relationship with no future is darn hard on them, too. Yet, they do it since they understand it’s necessary for their own long-term wellbeing.</span> </p>
