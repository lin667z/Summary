   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You might have noticed that nice girls always finish last, and men seem to prefer bad women. Why would that be?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Imagine a guy who wears white socks during sex. He has a unibrow and looks like he accidently swallowed a bowling ball. As if that’s not enough, it’s a guy who thinks deodorant is optional. Did I mention he still lives with his mother? It’s quite all right. He has a midnight curfew since he’s already over thirty-five and all... I think you get where I’m going with this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Might it be possible this guy will give you the creeps?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Well, that’s exactly how men feel when they’re with an overly nice, good girl. Even when she’s super attractive! Granted, it will take a couple of weeks before he’ll get the feeling, but believe me, it will come.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Well, to this I say, “fuck him!” Men are stupid. I can vouch for this, since I’m one myself. We’re wired in a weird way, totally illogical when it comes to romance, love, and relationships. You might wonder, “So what are you saying? Can I never be </span><span class="calibre17">good</span><span class="calibre3"> to a guy? Will I be doomed to singledom forever because I am a </span><span class="calibre17">good</span><span class="calibre3"> girl?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It depends what you mean by </span><span class="calibre17">good</span><span class="calibre3">. Let me give you the profile of the good/nice girl that men start to dislike.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">1. She’s looking for the one. </span><span class="calibre3">I know, we all are. Men as well! But that’s not all. Not only is she looking for the one, she also quickly believes she has found him. And this last part is the big mistake.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">These nice girls have been with a man for a couple of weeks and then start to make a big deal out of the relationship. They quickly ask where </span><span class="calibre17">this</span><span class="calibre3"> is going. They also accept not-so-great behavior (even though they might complain about it) and keep hoping he will change. She hopes that one day he’ll see how great she is and treat her accordingly. These nice girls cannot help it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">One of the consequences of this characteristic is this woman quickly goes all-in and treats him like a king even though he doesn’t treat </span><span class="calibre17">her</span><span class="calibre3"> like a queen. Moreover, some nice girls put him </span><span class="calibre17">so </span><span class="calibre3">high on a pedestal that they think better of him than even he thinks of himself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">2.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre18">She tries to impress him</span><span class="calibre3"> when it should be the other way around. The nice girl often has a deeply engrained belief that she is not enough. So she must compensate by being nice or overly supportive and kind. There’s no faster way to devalue yourself than by trying to impress him. This action, by definition, proves to him that you believe you’re beneath him. A man should always look up to his woman; he should never look down on her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Suppose I met you in a bar and tried to impress you by jiggling the keys to my Porsche and that I told you I’m an investment banker who makes a gazillion dollars a year. Chances are, your radar is going to sound loud and clear. You may think, “What’s the catch?” or “Why does he feel he’s not enough? Maybe he </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> not enough!” Trying to impress you in this way, I’ve immediately devalued myself.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When a woman tries to impress a man she’s been with for less than a couple of months, she immediately devalues herself. It really should be the other way around! He should be trying to impress you! I’ll show you how to get there later on in this book.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Remember, your actions define how valuable he thinks you are. If you continuously try to give him everything he (might) want, there’s nothing left to chase. He will have to go looking for that chase somewhere else. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Do not give a man what he wants. As counter intuitive as this may sound, the more you try to please him by giving him what he wants (even what he says he wants), the more you’re devaluing yourself. Granted, if he’s going all in and treating you really well, you should put in an effort too. I’ll discuss that in detail later.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">3.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span><span class="calibre18">She seeks his approval and tries to please him. </span><span class="calibre3">This would be the total opposite of the “fuck him” attitude. Seeking his approval puts a ticking time bomb on his feelings and attraction toward a woman. By seeking his approval, a nice girl will position herself beneath him. That’s wrong. The king and queen are supposed to be equal.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If he’s not a gentleman, he’ll run as fast as he can.  If he </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> a gentleman, he’ll try to hold on a little longer but will eventually leave as well. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Most men won’t communicate any of this to you. Most men disappear or use excuses like “I’m not ready for a </span><span class="calibre17">serious </span><span class="calibre3">relationship” (but then they get married a couple of months later to a new woman they’ve just met). </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">They believe they’re helping the woman by not being transparent in an effort to avoid hurting her feelings. First of all, of course they’ve just hurt her feelings. What are these men thinking? Second, they’re not doing her any favors because chances are this poor good girl is going to continue making the same mistakes with every guy she meets since every guy says she’s not the problem. And none of these men have the balls to tell her what </span><span class="calibre17">really </span><span class="calibre3">happened. Well, to this I say, fuck him. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">4. She lets him call the shots. </span><span class="calibre3">Men truly are interested in the nice girl, at first. Jamie, one of my clients, was a nice girl. At 57 and after a nasty divorce 23 years earlier, she finally met another great man who swept her away. He was handsome, wealthy, successful, and above all, very respectful and kind. She had never ever met a guy like him. He called her daily, took her out on great dates, pulled out her chair, held the door open for her...</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">After three months of dating, he took her to a nice restaurant. During dinner he kneeled and took out a nice little black box from his jacket. He popped it open and to Jamie’s delight, a very shiny and seemingly expensive diamond was lighting up her eyes. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">“Jamie, I’ve never ever met a woman like you before. I feel like I’m 17 again, and I want to feel like this forever. Will you marry me?” he asked. Jamie, totally dazzled, felt as if she was in one of those princess fairy tales and quickly nodded her head. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Four weeks later, as the first wedding preparations had started, Jamie got a call from her fiancé: “Jamie, look, we’ve got to talk. Can we meet up?” Jamie was about to be dazzled again...</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Her fiancé explained that everything was going too fast, and he wanted to call off the wedding. He was not ready for a new relationship and wanted to stop seeing her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Can you see what went wrong here? </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s not that obvious. Everything seemed too great! Jamie never nagged, never pushed. Jamie never did anything. She went along for the ride. And </span><span class="calibre17">that’s</span><span class="calibre3"> exactly the problem. She let him call all of the shots. He went all-in way too fast, and Jamie let him. He then got spooked and ran away like a little boy who just saw a spider on his pillow.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A man needs to think he’s calling the shots, but truthfully, you should be the one steering the relationship. The nice girl hands over her power and her heart to the man she loves way too quickly. She does this to the bad men, but as you saw here, also to the good men.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There is a different approach, however. Let’s dig into this in the next chapter.</span> </p>
