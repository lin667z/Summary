   <p class="calibre58"> <a id="_Toc463016736"><span class="calibre59">Emotional Intelligence, the secret key</span></a> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre18"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I’m sure you’ve seen it. Emotional intelligence and thus self-control cut through anything. It’s the great differentiator between the nice girls who always finish last and the high-value women in loving relationships, especially in the beginning.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Imagine this. You go out on a date with a guy you’ve just met. He opens the door for you. He’s funny, interesting, doesn’t boast, asks a ton of questions because he really wants to get to know you...If you could design the perfect first date, this would be it. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What will your thoughts be as you’re brushing your teeth after a great kiss goodnight? Chances are, it will be something to the tune of “My God, this was perfect. After everything I’ve been through lately. Wow! He’s unlike </span><span class="calibre17">any</span><span class="calibre3"> other man I’ve ever met...” You wouldn’t be the first woman to think like this...partially because of the oxytocin that might already be rushing through your body just because of that first kiss.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman is human. She feels it, too! She also starts to wonder if he’s the one. Then she differentiates herself from the nice girl by thinking, “Stop. These are just my emotions. Life is not a Disney flick. I don’t know him well enough to feel all of these warm and fuzzy emotions. He might be the one. He might be a psychopath. I don’t know yet. Anyone can keep up an act for the duration of a first date, even a bad actor does this effortlessly. I was showing my best side, too.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">She doesn’t stop there. This is not a game to her where she tries to lock her heart and act cold and uninterested. Her attitude is simple. She thinks, “I don’t know yet. I’ll let these emotions do what they do, but I won’t act upon them. This can still go into every direction. I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt, and I’ll enjoy it for as long as it lasts. And if it doesn’t last, I’ll find someone else.” </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The more you control your own emotions, the more you’ll be able to control where </span><span class="calibre17">this</span><span class="calibre3"> goes. The more you let your oxytocin and “he’s the one!” feelings dominate, the more </span><span class="calibre17">he </span><span class="calibre3">will dominate. And what’s great is that this laid-back attitude will attract him even more. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I hear you. Controlling your emotions is not easy. It just isn’t. I’ve been practicing this emotional intelligence play ever since I read Daniel Goleman’s book </span><span class="calibre17">Emotional Intelligence</span><span class="calibre3"> many years ago. But here’s the good news. This is like a muscle. If you’ve ever been to a gym, you might have noticed the weights you simply cannot pick up become easy to lift if you gradually work your way up to them, letting the muscle evolve and get stronger.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Our mind has neural pathways that we create by our habits. As you were a toddler, walking on your two feet required a great deal of mental energy. You had to consciously go over all of the steps to take your first steps. This gradually grew into a new neural pathway, a habit. Now your brain can do it effortlessly. Same goes with managing our emotions. It takes a lot of practice, but it becomes easier and easier until it becomes an effortless automatism.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So the next time a guy sweeps you off your feet or if you’re currently under a guy’s spell, make a conscious emotional intelligent decision. Say to yourself, “These are just feelings. It’s like an energy going through my body, based upon my hormones and substances like oxytocin. These are </span><span class="calibre18">feelings</span><span class="calibre3">. They do not reflect reality. They might not even be real.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s true by the way. Coming from a background of panic attacks and unnecessary anxiety, I know firsthand how easy it is to have feelings that are not real. When I was anxious, there was no tiger in front of me about to eat me alive, yet my body acted that way.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When your body decides to have crush on any man, there possibly is no “the one” in front of you, even though your body acts that way. Keep giving him the benefit of the doubt, but keep repeating that these are just feelings. You do not need to act upon them. Nice girls feel these feelings, immerse themselves in it, crown him “the one,” and then give away their power to a guy who does not deserve it (yet). High-value women feel these feelings, decide they are just feelings, and use their rational mind, as they move forward to get to know him better. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">Never ever ever take his bad behavior personally. </span><span class="calibre3">This goes far beyond dating and relationships. Let me be Captain Obvious once again. When you’re walking around in the city and someone yells, “You have ugly hair!” does this mean you </span><span class="calibre17">do </span><span class="calibre3">have ugly hair? Hell no!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">How other people treat you tells a lot more about </span><span class="calibre17">them</span><span class="calibre3"> and how they feel than it says about you. Unless you’ve been with a guy for a while and let him walk all over you, then it partially </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> your fault. Still, you shouldn’t blame yourself. You can learn from it, move on, and decide to never ever make that same mistake again.  That too is being emotional intelligent.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We all mess up and make mistakes. Question is, do we keep making the same mistake? The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result; that’s not really emotionally intelligent behavior now, is it?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So the next time you feel any emotion when it comes to men, (good ones like love, semi-dangerous ones like infatuation, or bad ones like “I’m gonna crown him “the one”), take a step back and see it for what it is. Emotions. Nothing special. And most importantly, not always right!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Consciously and rationally decide what is best for your long-term life, and then try to stick to that path, regardless of what your emotions are telling you.</span> </p>
