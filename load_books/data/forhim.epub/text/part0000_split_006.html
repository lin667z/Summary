   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s a question I’ve pondered about day in and day out before starting my career as a dating coach. Why do women fall for bad boys? And more importantly, why do some women stay with a bad boy when it’s obvious she’s never ever going to get what she wants or deserves from </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3"> guy? </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Mind you, this is not just a trap for women with a below average IQ. I’ve seen very smart women stay with men who disrespected them daily. It took them weeks, sometimes months, before they could walk away.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There are a ton of superficial reasons for this, but they all boil down to one thing; even though humans are intelligent creatures, we’re still governed by our primal instincts—much more than we’d like to admit. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Dr. Breuning concluded her research by stating some women’s primal instincts are </span><span class="calibre17">so</span><span class="calibre3"> strong that their entire body believes these bad men will be able to protect them better than the nice guys. This primal instinct causes a woman to believe she needs protection. That was true until one hundred years ago, when every woman who wanted to make babies and live a long and healthy life </span><span class="calibre17">needed</span><span class="calibre3"> a man to take care of her and protect her.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And even today, this is still partially true. According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 35 percent of women worldwide have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime. And these are just the women who report it. This still blows my mind. Needless to say, there’s a very good reason why your primal instinct wants you to be protected by a man who loves you and would give his life to protect yours when needed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If you have a tendency to fall for bad guys, now you know why. Even though they treat you badly, your body thinks they will protect you better than those nice but weaker guys. Bad boys seem to ooze with self-confidence, and that’s exactly what fires your primal instincts. That said, the well-sculpted guys are often exactly the ones who have the least self-esteem. Narcissists are part of this group, too. They are </span><span class="calibre17">very</span><span class="calibre3"> bad for you but have become masters at hiding their true selves in the early stages of the relationship. They know exactly how to trigger a woman’s primal instincts to get her stuck in their traps. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You won’t be able to change your primal instincts, but you </span><span class="calibre17">can</span><span class="calibre3"> explain to yourself why it’s happening and that you shouldn’t listen to it. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s dive into some of the ways he might trigger your primal instincts in the next chapter.</span> </p>
