   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Have you ever been with a guy and wondered, “Ah. I really wish he would”...or “I wish he would no longer...”? This is, of course, a rhetorical question. Of course it has! No man is perfect... except in his own eyes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If you didn’t pick an overly nice guy who will be bowing at your feet by the first date, ready to kiss your perfectly manicured toes, ready for your commands, ready to please you 24/7 like an English butler... getting him to do something or change his behavior isn’t straightforward.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This makes me think about Janice, a woman I coached a couple of years ago. Janice had attracted a great guy, a lawyer. She was a successful entrepreneur herself and had a chain of retail stores. Mark, the fake name I’ll use for her boyfriend, had a very busy schedule. So the two of them only had a couple of hours every week they could spend together, even though they were already living under the same roof at that time. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Mark loved Janice, but he loved his friends too. Every Friday night he would go out with the boys. Janice was free to join them, of course. But she had quickly learned that such a testosterone-filled night was not what she was looking for after a hard week of to-do lists and stress. Sunday afternoons were kept free by Mark to play golf with friends, clients, or prospects.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Janice wanted to spend more quality time together with Mark, and she had addressed this to him often, borderline nagging about it. This made Mark feel very uncomfortable. At first he had tried to stay home more, because Janice asked for it. Nevertheless, Janice soon learned that Mark wasn’t really present mentally. He even became </span><span class="calibre17">more</span><span class="calibre3"> distant. A couple of weeks later, he just went golfing again and told her it was important to him. Complaining and nagging didn’t work. What other options did Janice have here? </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We’ll need to look at the three-year-old kid again. If you tell that kid he can’t do something, he’ll rebel and only want to do it more. Adult men are, again, no different. By telling him he can’t do something, you’ve created a challenge, and that’s exactly what will attract him to do it. If you force him to change his behavior, he’ll start to resent you for it. He’ll feel less happy and will blame that on you. Every time a man </span><span class="calibre17">has</span><span class="calibre3"> to do something for you, you’re building up resentment and seriously hurting the feelings he has for you. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Moreover, you’ll notice some women keep adding to the list of to-dos. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“Let me know when you’ve arrived safely.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“Let me know when you’re coming home from work.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“Who was that on the phone?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“What were you doing?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“Who was with you?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“Are you really going to wear </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3"> shirt?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">“Don’t forget to...”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">They act just like his mother. Men love their mothers (if they treated them well while they were growing up), but they won’t feel attracted to her. They can’t. Plus, they only have room for one mother in their lives. They don’t need another one. They need a woman they can be passionately attracted to and in love with. The more rules and to-dos you give him, the more he will feel suffocated. And as I’m sure you know, men have a very low tolerance to this.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The big trick to get a man to do just about anything is to always give him the feeling that it was </span><span class="calibre17">his</span><span class="calibre3"> own decision. If he comes to the conclusion himself, he will not rebel and will stand by it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So what was Janice to do if she wanted to spend more quality time with her guy? How could she steer him in the direction she wanted him to go? I gave her one simple assignment: “Encourage him playing golf, support him, congratulate him when he got great results. Tell him you’re happy he goes out with his friends, happy that he plays golf, because that gives you the chance to (insert something that’s important to you and that shows you’re a high-value woman).” So that’s exactly what Janice did. She became a member of an improv group, she joined a spinning class, etc.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre35"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">26 days. That’s exactly what it took before Mark’s behavior changed. This time </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> told her, “Hey honey. What would you say if I skipped golf next Sunday and you skip your improv class so we can have lunch and spend the afternoon together?”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre35"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What should Janice have replied to this? Please stop reading and take a second to formulate your answer.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The nice girl in Janice could have responded, “Sure, great idea! Yes, I’m so happy! Sure, I’ll skip class. Where will you be taking me?” </span><span class="calibre18">But that would have been a huge mistake</span><span class="calibre3">. This would prove that Janice wasn’t that interested in her improv classes, that she still positioned Mark above all that, and the </span><span class="calibre17">only</span><span class="calibre3"> reason she partook in those activities was because he was not available. The minute he was free, she dropped everything. This would have devalued her in Mark’s eyes. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Janice luckily didn’t make this mistake. I had been coaching her for a while, and she had been applying other things that you’ll read in this book. Her newfound instincts helped her to immediately see what was going on:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre27"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre32"> <span class="calibre3">Mark had given her more value.</span> </li> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre33"> <span class="calibre3">Because she found other interests she was passionate about, he wanted to ditch his friends and spend time with her.</span> </li> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre34"> <span class="calibre3">If she would now change her own plans, </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> would have been in control all along and would subconsciously devalue her.</span> </li> 
    <li value="4" class="calibre36"> <span class="calibre3">Plus, it didn’t feel right. She wasn’t playing any games. She actually enjoyed improv and wanted to go (even though she, of course, wanted to spend more time with Mark too).</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre35"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So here’s how she replied. She said, “Great idea, Mark! However, this Sunday isn’t a good fit. I’m going to go to the improv group, and then we’re going out for a drink afterward. But let’s take our calendars and find a time that fits us both.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">They found a time and had a great date. Not long after, Mark decided to stop playing golf and be home on Sunday afternoons. </span><span class="calibre17">If</span><span class="calibre3"> Janice had nothing to do, they could spend time together. Janice didn’t have to nag; she didn’t even have to ask him. It was all his idea...Or was it?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men always want what they cannot have. Take something away, and he’ll want it more. Increase your value, and he’ll want you more. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre35"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">To men, it’s an effort to do anything they </span><span class="calibre17">have to</span><span class="calibre3"> do relationship wise. Putting in hard work to chase you, to be with you, and treating you well when they decided to do so on their own is effortless. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre37">Don’t follow your instincts or your intuition when you want to steer a man’s behavior. Do the opposite. That’s how you best raise a three-year-old kid, too. If you want him to do something (or stop doing something), nagging or yelling will not work. Ignoring him always will.</span><span class="calibre18"> Reinforce the good behavior, but ignore him whenever he shows bad behavior. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre35"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I want to elaborate a bit here. I’m not saying that you should ignore bad behavior and just let him take you for granted or mistreat you in any way. You simply ignore him. You become less available, take longer to return his phone calls, have more important things to do than be available all the time. (You never should be available all the time anyway.)</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">All great men love strong women—women who won’t take any crap. He will test this interestingly enough. He might and probably will give you some crap. And when he does, how you respond will define the rest of the relationship.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ll read plenty of ways to respond throughout this book. But if you’re ever in doubt, simply follow the golden rule. When a man doesn’t behave the way you want, withdraw and do what you would do if you found him less important.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This always works!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If he’s interested but doesn’t spend enough time with you, withdraw. </span><span class="calibre17">If </span><span class="calibre3">he’s interested, he’ll want to spend more time together. If he’s late to more than one date, withdraw. If he’s interested, he’ll never be late again (or at least have the courtesy to give you a heads-up in advance). </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If he says he’s coming out of a difficult relationship and not looking for anything serious, withdraw a bit and say, “Sure, me neither. I don’t know you well enough to decide if I even want a relationship with you. We can always be friends first and see where that goes.” </span><span class="calibre17">If</span><span class="calibre3"> he’s interested, you’ll quickly see him get his hunting gear in order to catch you. Make sure he never can, and he’ll keep running after you forever. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That last sentence might make you think, “All good and well, Brian, but if he can never catch me, how on earth will I then ever have a real relationship with him?” Simple. He should never be able to catch and cage you. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Before I became a relationship coach, I interviewed hundreds of couples that were together for more than ten years and to the astonishment of their divorced friends, were still happy. I wanted to know what their secret was. Some had been married for over forty years. The men in those relationships and marriages never </span><span class="calibre17">got</span><span class="calibre3"> their women. They always knew that they had to keep up their game. If not, she might still walk away. These women never threatened to walk. They showed them by ignoring their husbands and withdrawing whenever their behavior was unwanted. They always reinforced good behavior and ignored bad behavior.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Stick to that rule and you’ll never lose the interest of a man who’s truly interested in the first place. Those who were just playing games, trying to get laid, trying to get your money or God knows what will disappear. And that’s, although hurtful, good news.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Moreover, by ignoring him when he doesn’t add value to your life and by rewarding him when he shows good behavior, you’re training him just like you would a dog. And since most men are smarter than your average Labrador (some are, I’ve checked), it will be easy to train him. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You must never forget that a man who loves you will always love to work hard to make you happy! If he doesn’t do it, that’s a major red flag and a simple sign that he’s not really in to you. If that’s ever the case… NEXT!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We all deserve to be with someone who adores us as much as we adore them.</span> </p>
