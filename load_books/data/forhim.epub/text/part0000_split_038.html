   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Don’t you love it how every chick flick, romantic flick, well, just about any flick ends with the hero girl and the hero boy falling in love and sailing off into the known future of unconditional love and never ending happiness.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">How many real people do you know like that? Chances are not a lot...maybe none. Probably none.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We all have our problems. Love is not unconditional, and the prince on the white horse does not exist. The high-value woman doesn’t expect him to exist. She knows every man she meets will have flaws and imperfections, just like she does, and that’s perfect. She wouldn’t have it any other way. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is where she finds her strength. She’s never needy and manages her emotions pretty well because she sees right through them. She’s living </span><span class="calibre17">her</span><span class="calibre3"> life. She focuses on what’s important to her. Even though she hopes to find a great man she can take along for the ride, it’s not a must. It’s not a need. She’s happy either way. With or without her prince charming. This alone makes her very attractive to all the great men she meets.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Most importantly, she doesn’t wait for a man to change. She doesn’t accept any bad behavior. She doesn’t take any excuses. She’s just gone, living happily ever after.</span> </p>
