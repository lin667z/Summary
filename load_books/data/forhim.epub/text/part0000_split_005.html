   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When it comes to fucking a man, there are two rules.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Rule number one: never share your body with him too soon. There are multiple reasons for this. The crucial one is that you’ll fall in love way too hard, way too soon. Dr. Breuning, Professor Emerita at California State University, explained this very well in </span><span class="calibre17">Psychology Today</span><span class="calibre3">.</span><a id="_ftnref1"></a><a href="part0000_split_039.html#_ftn1"><span class="calibre22">[1]</span></a><span class="calibre3"> When a man touches a woman (yes, one intimate touch is enough) and definitely after sex, she gets the love hormone called oxytocin rushing through her body. This is a very tricky and deceptive little hormone. It’s nature’s way of creating a bond between you and that man. Nature doesn’t know contraceptives exist, so after sex, a woman might become pregnant. That’s why it’s imperative the guy sticks around to protect and provide for the mother and child. So she gets oxytocin. The effects of oxytocin, however, are where the traps lie. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Dr. Breuning confirms oxytocin will make you evaluate others more positively (than they might be). On top of that, oxytocin tells a woman “this is the one.” And that’s a trap. The oxytocin hasn’t lived with that guy for five years yet; it didn’t spend time with him during the good </span><span class="calibre17">and</span><span class="calibre3"> the bad periods of his life, and it didn’t check whether he respects her or takes her for granted, whether he cleans up after himself, etc. It did none of that homework! So if the woman falls for what the oxytocin makes her feel, she’s stuck in the trap. And more importantly, her clingy behavior will soon become too intimidating to the guy, causing him to run. And it’s not even her fault! The clingy behavior is a pure consequence of that darn oxytocin. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Long story short, don’t sleep with him too soon or learn how to look past the blinders the oxytocin will give. The first part is way easier than the second, so that’s your safest bet.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Another major reason why you shouldn’t share your bed with him too soon is you’ve just given him a precious asset. You are without a doubt so much more than your body! I know you probably are a great friend and trustworthy person with a riveting personality and so much more to offer. But </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> doesn’t know that yet.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When a man walks up to you or goes out on a date, it’s not because of your personality! He thinks you’re physically attractive. I’m here to tell you the truth. Men don’t care about your personality at first. Every single man who asks for your digits is purely interested in your body. Every man who stays with you after ten dates or so does so for your personality. It’s only after a couple months of dating that he starts to realize what a great person you are. Men are superficial at first. So don’t give him what he wants too soon. Work on that emotional connection first.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So the first rule of fucking a man is don’t share your body too soon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Rule number two: mentally fuck him as soon as you can! Not only will this force him to look past your body, it will create the mental challenge men so desperately need. Let me emphasize this. You can wait at least ten dates to have him see your personality, or you can speed up the process and force him to see the real you from the get go.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ll need to do this soon! From the first second you meet him. It’s imperative to be sassy and savvy and high value. When he’s out on a first date with you or has just walked up to you, he likes you physically. That first physical impression has been formed the moment he saw you. The more important first impression of your personality, however, is still being formed while you’re talking to him. And the sooner you get this right, the harder he will fall for you.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If you want him to treat you like a queen, act like a queen right out of the gate. No exceptions. I’ll get into the nitty gritty later in this book, but I want to emphasize that I use the word queen deliberately. No man wants a princess. A princess still doesn’t know what she wants, is emotionally unstable, and makes men uncomfortable. She acts young and flakey. The queen, however, knows what she wants, understands exactly how she wants to be treated, and will not accept any bad behavior. Period. The men who mistakenly believe they can disrespect her get to spend the rest of their lives in the cold, dark, and moldy dungeon.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s dive into the importance of this rule. If you fuck him mentally, he will look past your body. This is the very reason you’ll see average-looking women with super great guys. This strategy is one of their secrets. Some of the men they’re with might not have had any physical attraction for them at first, but these sassy women cultivated it through that strong mental challenge they represent.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So how does one mentally fuck him? You fuck him mentally when you leave him startled because of your behavior. Bad behavior (e.g., nagging and complaining) doesn’t startle men who’ve had a relationship or two. They expect it! They know it will come and simply use it as a cue to put their hooks out and find a new fish in the sea. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s when the nice girls hears, “Yeah, I’m not sure I’m ready for something serious, and I don’t want to hurt your feelings later on.” Just as most women have triggers to finding a guy repulsive, men are conditioned as well. They have been in bad relationships before and want to avoid living through those same experiences like the plague.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">High-value women do it differently. They startle him with some or all of the following behaviors:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Instead of falling head over heels for him, she decides what she feels (oxytocin) are just feelings. Feelings come and go. She doesn’t get infatuated. Any man she meets is on probation first, regardless of what her feelings tell her. She’s not hesitant or guarding herself; she simply doesn’t crown him the king before he has earned it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre25"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">She wants a relationship but not just any relationship. She’s happy to stay single for as long as necessary. If she stays single for the rest of her life, then she’ll still have fun and make the most of it. She realizes her neediness simply comes from her natural instincts that have been programmed to “get a man and make babies” (even though she might be 40 or 60 and babies are the last thing on her rational mind). She knows this is just her primitive programming, and she surpasses that. She would love to be in a great relationship but not so much that she would devalue herself. She never ever </span><span class="calibre17">needs</span><span class="calibre3"> a man or a relationship.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">Instead of hooking on to any man she meets and following all of those primitive instincts, she consciously wonders, “Is this the best guy to give my time to?” Here too she’ll have to surpass her primitive emotions, partially fueled by hormones like oxytocin. She uses her emotional intelligence, looks at the long term, and asks herself, “If this guy never changed, would I really want to be with him ten or twenty years from now?” </span><span class="calibre17">She</span><span class="calibre3"> is the one who’s still weighing all of his pros and cons. He feels it and starts to put in the hard, necessary work to gain </span><span class="calibre17">her</span><span class="calibre3"> approval. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">She knows she might not be the prettiest woman he could get. She was never the prom queen; she doesn’t look like a model, and when she goes out, most men hover around some of her other girlfriends. She doesn’t care. She </span><span class="calibre17">really</span><span class="calibre3"> doesn’t. These are not the types of men she wants anyway. Plus, she knows she doesn’t need her looks to get a great guy. Looks will fade at some point. She wants her man to be addicted to her personality. As a result, when she’s dating she doesn’t ask questions like: “Do you think I’m pretty?” or “What was your ex like?” If a guy was with her just for her looks, she would walk away anyway. She wants more from a relationship than this superficial stuff. She knows she’s a queen, not a princess. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre23"> <span class="calibre3">-</span><span class="calibre24">        </span><span class="calibre3">When the first date was great, she doesn’t text him afterward to let him know it was fun. She’s busy with her life, and she’ll see when and if he contacts her again. If he doesn’t, she won’t reach out to him! She only wants men who are sufficiently interested. She has 24 hours in a day, just like anyone else, of which she takes about 8 hours to sleep, 10 hours or so to work on her career, 1 hour to drive to and from work (if she’s lucky), 1 hour to walk or work out...that only leaves so much time. She knows she needs to spend it wisely. She looks at the ROI of her time. She doesn’t want to spend it on some guy who’s not putting in the hard work she deserves. If he’s more than ten minutes late for their date without calling her to exactly tell her why (and there better be a good reason!), she’s gone. If he wants to make it up to her, he can, but it better be good (a home cooked meal, for instance). </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I think you get the point. She places high value on her life, her heart, and her time. She wants the return on her time investment to be high, and she’ll let him know that, in a kind way, from the get-go.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Being kind is crucial here. She never behaves like a bitch. She’s kind but firm and strict. She brings her best self to the table and expects the same from her guy. When he fails to deliver, she’ll let him know right away. For example, she may say, “I had fun the first couple of dates, and I really like you, but I can’t be with a guy who... (fill in some behavior you don’t like).” She says this instead of complaining, “Why don’t you ever...” That’s the take-it-or-leave-it mentality she holds dearly.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The first couple of weeks of your interaction with a man set the stage. Whatever is set is difficult to change or remove later on. Men know this!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Did you ever really study how a three-year-old kid behaves around his mother? He tests her diligently and perpetually! He’ll continuously test her limits to see what he can get away with. Grown-up men are no different. From the get-go they’ll tease, play, and see what they can get away with.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here’s a little secret. The ideal woman to most men allows him to be the dictator in the relationship; she obeys his every command. When he wants sex, she gives it in any way he likes. When he’s hungry, she prepares him a five-course meal. When he’s watching TV and wants a beer, she’ll get him a cold one and prepares a little snack too, just in case he’s hungry. She totally ignores the fact that he’s getting a huge beer belly because of all those beers, and she continues to adore him physically. She continuously repeats that he’s the answer to her prayers. She even wonders out loud whether he </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> God, given his perfect abilities to do...well, just about anything. That’s what most men think they want.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Until they get it. Then they run.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s look at a different scenario that will provide great insight into how the mind of a man works. Suppose that in option one, a guy can get a job where he has a fixed salary of 10,000 dollars a month, every single month, year in and year out. His job performance is of no importance. Whether he shows up on time, or at all, doesn’t matter. He gets his salary every single month, paid on time.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s look at option two. In option two, our guy gets a salary of 10,000 dollars a month, but he has to work for it! He has to show up on time, put in a good performance, follow seminars to get better, read books, and improve. If he does all of this diligently, his salary will be paid every month.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Option one would sound like a dream to most guys! And probably to you too. What a life! But as a woman, you’re smart enough to look past this. What most guys don’t see—until they experience it—is that option one is boring. Only a few months into this scenario, he’ll start to take his salary for granted. He’ll be bored, even though this money allows him to buy most of the stuff he’s dreamt about for a long time. It has no value since there was no challenge. He doesn’t have to work for it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The second option, on the other hand, keeps him motivated and on his A-game. He values the money so much more because he’s had to work hard for it, month after month. I know there are exceptions, there are a lot of lazy couch-potato men out there too, but I’m guessing that’s not the type of guy you’re interested in anyway. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is why the high-value woman is so attractive, especially to ambitious men who long for success. Those are the men programmed to work for what they want. And when they don’t have to, whatever they were chasing gets devalued to below zero.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What remains important is that the high-value woman doesn’t play games. So this is not a ploy to get him to bend over and behave the way she wants. It is simply the only way that’s acceptable to her! Everything she says and does will prove her value, will prove that she </span><span class="calibre17">will</span><span class="calibre3"> walk away when he takes her for granted (he won’t), when he doesn’t treat her with respect (he might try, but then she’s gone).</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And she shows this from the very first second they meet. She’ll be sassy in her responses when he teases her. She’ll be assertive and strict when he tries to push or play her. She’ll stop giving him attention altogether when he shows undesirable behavior.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And she does it from the start. I cannot emphasize this enough. So many women I’ve coached during the last ten years got this wrong. When he did something wrong, these women thought, “Well, I can’t start nagging now. I’ll just keep it to myself. He’ll change later, and if he doesn’t, I’ll try to change him (by nagging).” Needless to say, this is a very bad strategy. He won’t understand where this is all coming from (“This wasn’t a problem when we first started dating. Why is it one now?”), and by that time, he has devalued her so much that he simply doesn’t care anymore. The nagging will go on for some time, and he still won’t change (or he will rebound after a temporary change in an effort to evade the nagging). Then he’ll be gone. This can be avoided by showing what’s important to you from the get-go, without nagging. I’ll give you the tactical details in a later chapter.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A relationship will always be based upon habits. If you create a habit where he doesn’t have to put in an effort at first, why would he change later? If sex is easy to get, why would he diligently work for it later? If he doesn’t need to treat you well, take you out, buy you flowers, put his best foot forward to get your attention and affection, why would he all of a sudden start doing this later?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Create the right habits as soon as you can. </span> </p>
