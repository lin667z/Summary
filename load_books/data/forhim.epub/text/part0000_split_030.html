   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Some of what I’ve been explaining might make you believe the high-value woman is high maintenance since she seems to have a lot of rules men have to live up to. She is, in fact, not high maintenance at all. She has a ton of self-respect and self-love, and she will protect it dearly. But that’s about it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">First of all, she almost never nags or complains. If she doesn’t like something her guy does, she will accord less time and attention to him, but she sure understands that relationships require work, hard work. This means she needs to adapt just as much as he will have to. She doesn’t make it any harder on him than she has to. She knows that wanting it your way all the time is for eight-year-old girls.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is hard, isn’t it? There’s an eight-year-old girl in all of us. In me, too! I’d love it if the entire world would continuously adapt to me and my every whim. Some people, however, truly expect this and get frustrated when it doesn’t happen. I’m sure you’re not one of them, but I’m sure you know a couple of people who expect this. They are the ones continuously frustrated.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Flexibility is important, for your own sake. Not being flexible is the easiest way to be unsatisfied and frustrated. </span> </p>
