   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman never plays hard to get. She never plays games at all. If the need to play games would ever arise, she simply withdraws. She will never ever fight for his attention; it should be the other way around. Men should be and will be fighting for </span><span class="calibre17">your</span><span class="calibre3"> attention. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Playing hard to get is still trying to get his attention. That’s the main difference. The high-quality woman will only give her attention to the men fighting for hers. She, of course, has a trick or two up her sleeve to make him fight for her. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The high-value woman </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> hard to get. She doesn’t need to play it. She doesn’t need to consciously map it out as a strategy. She only sparingly gives her time and attention to the men who work for it, the men putting in the necessary efforts.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A good relationship can never be built upon games, unless you don’t mind playing games for the rest of your life. Some women pick this path, but if you ask me, it’s a bad one. It results in major insecurities and will make your relationship the main worry in your life, all the time. If that’s the case, how on earth could you then build your career, friendships, and more when a guy keeps sucking away all of your brain power?</span> </p>
