   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is an important chapter. There’s usually a moment in any relationship when his attention will start to decline, when the new has gone and everything has settled in. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You come home from work, but he’d rather watch Netflix than talk about your day. You put on something sexy, but he’d rather check his emails than look at you. Would this worry you? Would this make you believe he’s losing interest?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You bet. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nevertheless, this may not be the case. Even a highly interested guy will eventually suffer from the declining-attention syndrome. It’s human nature. When Santa comes by and gives the three-year old boy a nice toy, he’ll play with it for a couple of days, weeks at the most, until he slowly starts to pay less attention to it. Is he no longer interested in his toy? </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Well, try to take it away from him and see what happens. “John, I see you’re no longer playing with your new toy. I’m going to give it to the neighbors’ kids, OK?” </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Little John won’t hesitate and will react as quickly as a chameleon can catch a fly. “No no, mommy! I still love it!” And you know what? He does! Question is, would it help if his mommy said, “John? Why don’t you ever play with your new toy? It’s as if you don’t like it anymore.” Of course not. It’s difficult to steer the behavior of a guy using words alone.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">And there’s more! Little Johnny knows mommy seems to love the new toy too, so she’s most surely </span><span class="calibre17">not</span><span class="calibre3"> going to take it away. He has allllll the time in the world to play with it whenever he wants in the future, so why the rush?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Grown men are no different.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">As I said, there inevitably comes a point in the relationship where he starts to take certain things for granted including the woman he’s with. Trying to talk about it is the worst thing you can do. Can you see why?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s a value-problem, yet again. The woman who nags and complains has just devalued herself, putting </span><span class="calibre17">him</span><span class="calibre3"> in the stronger position and giving </span><span class="calibre17">him</span><span class="calibre3"> all the power. The woman who nags has just proven that she will not walk away; otherwise, she would have.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Think of the toy again. The reason little Johnny gets bored of it is a) because he has played with it for a while and got used to it and b) he knows he’ll have the toy indefinitely, unconditionally. So why hurry?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">What if Santa would have told little Johnny that he gets the toy, but that one day the toy will disappear and be gone forever? Do you think little Johnny would let the toy out of sight, even for a second? Of course not! He would sleep with it under his pillow, attached to his wrist with a little cord...just to make sure.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men start to take a woman for granted and start to give her less attention the moment they are sure she will stick around. This has everything to do with his hierarchy of needs. Most men want to be with a great woman. So finding her is very high on the hierarchy of needs. They’ll put in a lot of time, money, and effort. Once that mission has been completed, that great woman has been found, attracted, dated, and now “relationshipped,” he can focus more on his other needs again...like Netflix indeed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This does not necessarily mean she’s less important to him! He simply considers it a mission completed.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Women who love to nag will then take out their nagging rulebook and say, “You used to think I was sexy in this” or “Why don’t you open doors for me like you used to when we just started dating?” or “We used to go for long, romantic walks, but you never have time for those anymore.”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">That’s where the high-value woman plays it differently. With her, the mission is never ever completed. She might vanish anytime, and she will most surely never ever nag. All of the phrases from the nagging rulebook prove one thing to the guy, “I’ve got her. She’s not going anywhere.” Both the bad </span><span class="calibre17">and</span><span class="calibre3"> the good guys will think it and will devalue the woman they’re with. And you know what? Women do the exact same thing with nagging guys.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nagging is like bluffing. A woman who nags has just proven that she won’t run. She’ll wait. And that’s the exact opposite of what he needs. He needs you to withdraw a bit, without an explanation! </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let me repeat: don’t use words when you want to change a man’s behavior! Withdraw a bit for small infractions and a lot for major infractions. No words needed. Talking about it doesn’t help anyway. Men can’t talk about these things since they mostly don’t have a clue of what they’re feeling anyway.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Remember, reinforce the good behavior, ignore him when he shows unwanted behavior. Ignoring is the worst punishment you can give a child and even an adult. There’s a tribe in Africa where, instead of giving criminals the death penalty, they are to be ignored by everyone, as if they no longer exist. Nobody looks at them; nobody talks to them. It’s as if they became invisible ghosts. That’s worse than death. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Long story short, when his attention for you starts to wane, do the same. Withdraw. This will peak his interest because it’s unexpected. He expects you to nag! He doesn’t expect you to withdraw. If you withdraw, he’ll wonder what’s going on and, regardless how long you’ve been together, will start chasing you more.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Take his toy away.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">If and when he asks why, </span><span class="calibre17">then</span><span class="calibre3"> you can talk. That said, don’t show him the playbook. Don’t say, “Well, I decided to spend less time with you because you seem to have lost interest in me.” Instead say, “We were spending so much time together that I needed some space to (spend more time with friends, spend time on me, etc.).”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here’s why this works: </span><span class="calibre18">men know how to treat women well!</span><span class="calibre3"> They do it all the time when they’re out on a first, second, and maybe still the third date. Soon after, Alzheimer starts to kick in and they seem to forget how to treat a woman right. Here’s a secret: they haven’t forgotten! He knows he’s not treating you as well as he should. He expects you to nag about it, all of his exes did! If and when you don’t nag, </span><span class="calibre17">his</span><span class="calibre3"> alarm bells will go off. He’ll start to worry and will have concerns. Your reaction will be so unpredictable that it will make him wonder what he should do to be better. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men lose attention when they feel secure, when they are sure you won’t leave. Take away this security whenever you want to increase his attraction. This is a powerful weapon! The high-value woman never misuses it. It’s her automated reaction whenever he takes her for granted, disrespects her, or does any of the other no-nos. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Abraham Maslow, quite an interesting fellow you might have heard of, came up with the hierarchy of needs. We all have one. It’s a pyramid of needs and when one need is met, we start to worry about the next need. A simple example of this hierarchy of needs would be this: say you have some problems in your business. You found an unmet need and worry about it; you ponder and look for a solution. You come home from work, you open the fridge, and it’s totally empty. Nothing to eat and you happen to live in the only town where no takeout or restaurant food can be found. On top of that, all the shops are closed and will be for the next seven days because of a strike...in your entire state. Finding food to eat will become a major and semi-urgent need. You’ll put the problems at work aside and start to use your mental resources on finding something to eat. Or just imagine what would happen if you were scuba diving and somehow your air supply is cut off. That would be a major need, wouldn’t it?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">We all have a pyramid-like hierarchy of needs. When the basic needs have been met (oxygen, water, food), we start to worry about finding a roof over our heads. When we get that, we worry about what furniture to buy. When </span><span class="calibre17">all</span><span class="calibre3"> of the basic needs have been met, we worry about our jobs, or our love life.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Men have this hierarchy of needs as well. Somewhere in his pyramid you’ll find, “find a good woman who adores me.” When that need has been met, he goes on to a higher layer of the pyramid like “What seats should I get for the Sunday football game?” or “How can I get a promotion?” or “John and I should really go out for drinks to catch up.” He can worry about these because a more basic need, find a good woman who adores me, has been met. As long as he feels sure and secure about this need, he moves on to more specialized needs.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I think you see the strategy I’m about to explain, but I want to make sure you get that you can only use it sparingly. If you need to use this strategy monthly or worse, weekly, you’re not with the right guy.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So here you are, in a relationship with a guy who starts to find going out with friends, work, or anything else </span><span class="calibre17">more </span><span class="calibre3">important than you. It might be that you’re dealing with a bad man, someone who’s stringing you along. These types of men I’ve described in my other book </span><span class="calibre17">Red Flags, Signs He’s Playing Games with You</span><span class="calibre3">, but in this book, I’ll presuppose he loves you and cares about you. When he moves on to other things, it’s simply Maslow’s hierarchy of needs at play. So what you can do is make him downshift in his pyramid. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">He will </span><span class="calibre17">only</span><span class="calibre3"> be able to enjoy his friends, work, golf, football, whatever </span><span class="calibre17">if</span><span class="calibre3"> he’s sure and secure about your feelings for him. That’s why and when you withdraw, he’ll put his full attention on you again. He has a major unmet need and wants to fix it, he’ll seek your reassurance.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Did I ever tell you the story of walking my dog in the woods? I love the psychology of all things alive, and I used to be fascinated by how we interact with dogs since we cannot really talk to them. “What was the fastest way to have a dog that behaves so well that movie-dogs could learn a lesson or two from him?” I always wondered.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">One day I was out for a walk in the woods with my dog, and we’re walking on a wide path with a line of trees on the left and the right. I unleashed my young dog and off he went, running straight ahead. Some new dog owners then panic and start to run after the dog. That’s always a funny sight, isn’t it? The dog thinks, “Hey great! My owner is running after me, so I can keep going, I’m leading the pack! Look at me, so young and already leading the pack!” These dogs feel too sure and secure.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So I applied a different strategy. I noticed my dog wasn’t even looking back to check my location, so I hid behind a tree. I was purposely carrying a little mirror so I could still keep an eye out on him without being noticed. As he was far in front of me, he turned around, still sure up to that moment that I was simply following, as if I was part of </span><span class="calibre17">his</span><span class="calibre3"> pack. I wasn’t around, and he couldn’t see me. He panicked and started to run back, trying to pick up my trace. He couldn’t since I hadn’t been there yet. He searched and searched until he finally found me, standing behind that tree. He was so happy and had been so scared that, from that day off, he always stuck around and if he was in front of me, he checked back every couple of seconds to make sure I was still there.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Well, you see where I’m going with this… </span><span class="calibre17">This</span><span class="calibre3"> is exactly what the high-value woman does with the guy she’s with. She makes sure he keeps checking she’s still around. He keeps putting in an effort because he knows if he slacks, she might be gone.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">A man should never ever be totally sure that you unconditionally love him. For if he is sure, he’ll move on to the next item in his hierarchy of needs. </span><div class="calibre5" id="calibre_pb_87"></div>
