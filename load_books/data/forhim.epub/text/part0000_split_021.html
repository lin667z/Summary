   <h1 class="calibre20"> <span class="calibre44"> </span> </h1> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Ah, love! There’s nothing better than meeting someone who sparks all the butterflies in your stomach with a single look or a single date. When this happens, it feels like you’ve finally found the path to happily ever after. Only, fairy tales are just that, fairy tales. As much as we all like to feel like a teenager in love again, it can be disastrous to your love life when you do it too soon. There is a time and place for intoxicating romance, but that time is rarely in the very beginning of the encounter. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Even though you’d love nothing more than to spend all of your attention on Mr. Right, you’ll need to keep dosing it well until </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> has proven his worth. Be as eager as he is, never more. He should always be the one chasing you and showing his interest in you, not the other way around. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Some women make mistakes here. They’re so happy to be in love that they lavish their new guy with attention, affection, and love. He doesn’t deserve this yet. Most men, especially great men, will consider this desperate behavior. It is. It stems from some kind of anxiety where these women think, “Oh, finally! A great guy. I must latch and hold on to him forever. Let me crush him with my love to prove to him what I’m worth.” This will indeed crush him, and he will run away. For some women, this behavior stems from a fear of never finding a great man and when one then finally comes along, he must not be lost. These women place </span><span class="calibre17">that</span><span class="calibre3"> much value on him that they totally devalue themselves. This very anxiety will spread on to him. I have yet to meet a guy who can live with this burden. He needs to know he has worked for your love and attention. What is given too soon and freely seems cheap. Your love and attention are not cheap. So be careful on whom you spend it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">High-value women know what they are worth. They’d rather be single than in a relationship with the wrong kind of guy. They spoon-feed their attention to guys who haven’t proven their worth yet. And when I talk about worth, I never mean financially. I’m talking about courteous behavior, respect, and most importantly, authenticity. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">High-quality men want to fight for your attention. This is a tricky one. Some women know this and then try to make a man jealous by openly flirting with other men. This might work on low-quality men with fragile egos, but high-quality men see right through this ploy and consider it needy behavior. It’s a different fight they need and like.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Consider this. You meet a great guy, and </span><span class="calibre17">you</span><span class="calibre3"> have started the conversation. After only 5-7 minutes, you say, “It was nice talking to you. I’ve got to go back to...(work/my friends/someone else).” You’ve just increased your value considerably. You clearly are a woman who has a lot going on in her life. You don’t clinch onto the first guy you meet. If he wants more of you, he’ll have to fight for it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is a very strong high-quality signal that can significantly increase the quality of the first impression you’ve made. If you meet someone, even though you’d like to spend the next 100 years by his side, be gone after a couple of minutes. You can always come back later. That, or he can run after you, which is even better.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Were you ever approached by a guy who introduced himself and then just hung around? You just couldn’t get rid of him. That clingy behavior will make you uncomfortable within minutes. The most important people, during any networking event, move around from one group to another. If they’re not the organizer, they behave like one, introducing themselves here and there, asking a couple of interesting questions, and moving around the room. They then go back to the people they found really interesting, the people who earned their attention. If you use this strategy on men, you’ll significantly raise your value. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre18">Always make them earn your attention. </span><span class="calibre3">From the very first second they meet you until long after “I do.” </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">The more important and high quality the man is, the </span><span class="calibre17">more</span><span class="calibre3"> he should earn your attention. There’s an important strategy behind this. Picture a great guy. He’s good-looking, smart, and athletic. Ever since he turned 16, he’s been getting more attention from women than his male friends, who obviously envy him. He was the guy who always got the best-looking girlfriends. Some of these guys then turn into obnoxious bad boys who deserve to be in dating hell. Don’t worry. They eventually get there. A smaller group of these lucky men stay gentlemen. They are a rare breed, and they know it. They get attention from women here and there and get many offers. After their first relationship experiences, they start to become picky, because they can. As they meet women, they feel they could get seven out of every ten women they meet. These are, however, not the women they want. They wonder why the three women they seemingly have no powers over are different. These are the women they are interested in and want to get to know better.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This doesn’t mean you cannot initiate contact. It </span><span class="calibre17">does</span><span class="calibre3"> mean the better the guy you’re interested in is, the more it becomes important to let the guy do the chasing. Great men have enough women throwing themselves at their feet. The high-value woman is different. You are high value and can be picky too. He will sense that, and that’s what will trigger his initial attraction level. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">So how do you show this to him quickly? </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Your time is one of your most valuable assets. Time is the only thing we can never buy more of. The clock keeps ticking, so what you spend your time on is important; it’s like a vote. You vote something as important by spending time on it. Only start to chip away time normally spent with friends, family, your hobbies, even your pets when he </span><span class="calibre17">really</span><span class="calibre3"> deserves it. Always spoon-feed your attention and your time in the beginning. That will be crucial if you want to create a great first impression.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Don’t give up your hobbies, leisure, anything. I’ve coached so many women who skip yoga class, tennis, cooking class, and more just to spend time with a guy who doesn’t deserve it yet. Make him work for your time first!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Crucially, this also means you are not the one who </span><span class="calibre17">keeps</span><span class="calibre3"> initiating contact. It’s OK to initiate the first contact, but then it’s up to him. A lot of women make mistakes here. They believe, “Well, we’re no longer living in the fifties. Why would a woman not be able to get in touch with a guy whenever and however much she pleases?” I get it. Like I always say, women are equal to men (if not better than men), but men and women are not alike. There are certain rules that govern the way attraction works. You can fight those rules, but your love life will probably suffer the consequences. When you keep initiating contact, your attention becomes cheap. It’s freely available. He doesn’t have to work for it. You might as well hang a sign around your neck that says, “Grab and go!” And we both know you’re not like that, but </span><span class="calibre17">he</span><span class="calibre3"> won’t!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre37">The biggest reason, in my opinion, why your attention should never come cheap is because it will automatically weed out the bad men. I think you will agree when I say that the guy who deserves to be in a long-term relationship with you should be someone who doesn’t take you for granted, who fought for you, and who gladly has put in the time and effort required to get you. The men who do this will never be ambivalent. You’ll never have to wonder, “Does he like me? Does he like me not?” This strategy will automatically weed out the doubters or men with other issues.</span> </p>
