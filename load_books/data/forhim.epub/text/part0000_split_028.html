   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Your most powerful asset is not, contrary to popular belief, your bosom or your sexy behind. I know it’s hard to imagine men who can look beyond the physical attributes of a woman. These men are out there, but I admit, they are in short supply.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">All kidding aside, your most powerful asset is your self-respect. If you take an introspective look at yourself, you may ask how much do you adapt or even change your behavior to get someone’s approval? This is a mistake I used to make a lot in the past. So many people (the old me included) waste so much time on trying to be liked or on trying to change the behavior of other people. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s continue to be vulnerable and honest. How many times did you get mad, nag, or complain because you wanted someone else to change his or her behavior? Did it work in the long term?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It never does.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When you adapt your behavior to get anything from anyone, you are setting your self-respect aside. And yet your self-respect is your most attractive trait. It’s one that will never age or fade as long as you </span><span class="calibre17">choose</span><span class="calibre3"> to keep it intact. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s look at the average woman as an example. She’s been in a relationship with a guy for two months. They’re not living together. She keeps bringing up the subject of moving in but whenever she does, he withdraws and starts to stonewall her. He also doesn’t always return her phone calls and has other flaky behavior. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Can you get what our average woman will do in an attempt to change his behavior?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">She will:</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre45"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre46"> <span class="calibre3">Nag</span> </li> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre47"> <span class="calibre3">Get mad</span> </li> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre48"> <span class="calibre3">Complain</span> </li> 
    <li value="4" class="calibre49"> <span class="calibre3">Keep bringing it up</span> </li> 
    <li value="5" class="calibre50"> <span class="calibre3">All of the above</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">You’ve guessed it. The correct answer is E. She will do all of the above. Most probably not all at the same time, yet she will try different variations of nagging, getting mad, complaining, and she will definitely keep bringing it up.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">OK. How would the high-value woman respond in this exact situation?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <ol class="calibre45"> 
    <li value="1" class="calibre46"> <span class="calibre3">She will give him less attention.</span> </li> 
    <li value="2" class="calibre47"> <span class="calibre3">She will start seeing him less.</span> </li> 
    <li value="3" class="calibre48"> <span class="calibre3">She will not go out of her way to cater his needs.</span> </li> 
    <li value="4" class="calibre49"> <span class="calibre3">She will spend more time on her hobbies, seeing her friends and family, etc.</span> </li> 
    <li value="5" class="calibre50"> <span class="calibre3">All of the above</span> </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Yes, you are good! I know you’ve guessed it. It’s E again. It seems so simple and yet this is a mistake that’s easily made.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Here’s why that is. We, humans, do not like change. We resent it and would love for everything to stay just the way it is (unless it’s bad, of course). How do </span><span class="calibre17">you</span><span class="calibre3"> deal with change?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">When we’re in a relationship with someone, we’re happy we’ve found someone to love, someone who hopefully loves us back, and someone we can have a good time with. If that person then doesn’t seem right for us or starts to display behavior we dislike, the rational solution would be to dump that person straight away. NEXT!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">However, that would represent a massive change. It would mean breaking up with that guy, going through the hardship of that breakup, and then being single...again. Who knows when the next great guy will come along, if ever.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">These might be thoughts you then have. They are nevertheless nothing more than your negative voice that will always keep yapping negative stuff in your ear. We all have it and what it says is often a simple distortion. Some women, however, do listen and then figure. “If I could just get him to pay more attention to me, to move in with me, to...”.  That sounds like the path with the least change and thus the least resistance. Question is, is it really?</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">This is where the high-value woman makes the difference and why she, in fact, </span><span class="calibre17">is</span><span class="calibre3"> high value. She too first believes changing his behavior would be easiest, but then her emotional intelligence kicks in. She realizes, “Do I really want to be with a guy who doesn’t want to be with me, at least not as much as I want to be with him? Do I not deserve better? I’m better off single!” Then, in her case too, the negative voice will kick in. She may think, “Yeah, but that means I’ll be single forever. I might never ever find a great guy…”</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">She knows this is just a mind game her negative voice will play. That’s what negative voices do, just like the little devil that always floats around the heads of cartoon characters. So she makes up her mind and thinks, “I don’t care. If I’ll be alone forever then so be it. I’m a great girl, and I’ll find a great man. The only way to never find him is to stay with a guy who doesn’t deserve my attention.” And off she goes.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Great men have a radar for this. They love women with self-respect since they have a lot of it themselves. Having a lot of self-respect is an important high-value signal. It cannot be faked, botoxed, or implanted. You’ve either taken the time to develop it, or not. Self-respect is like a muscle. It needs to be trained if you want it to be strong since it’s easier to take the path of no self-respect and to adapt. </span> </p>
