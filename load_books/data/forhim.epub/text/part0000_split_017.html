   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Great men are in short supply. If we weed out all the bad types of men, like the players, narcissists, overly nice guys, perverts, psychopaths, losers, mommy boys... there are not a lot of men left.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Like you, other women have a nose for these great guys. This gives these men the power of choice. You’ll need to compete with other women. Something you might not even want to do in the first place! You’re not doing yourself any favors. You </span><span class="calibre17">should</span><span class="calibre3"> compete. You’re worth it. You deserve the best type of love life you can get. And nothing that’s worth having is ever effortless. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">It’s not a fight, mind you. It’s not a real competition. It’s never the woman who’s overtly fighting for attention who gets the great guy. This is by definition a low-value woman in their opinion. Competing, in this case, means being more laid back and putting in </span><span class="calibre17">less</span><span class="calibre3"> of an effort! Not more. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">These great men fall for confident women. Confidence is a word that covers a lot of ground. There’s not just one type of confidence. Confidence means knowing you have a certain area of your life fully under control. So you could be very confident in the fact that you know how to cook well and then have no confidence at all when it comes to walking up to a guy or knowing what to say during the first date. </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">There’s no need for you to be confident in every area of your life. Nobody is anyway.</span> </p>
