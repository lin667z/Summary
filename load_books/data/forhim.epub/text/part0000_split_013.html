   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">I hope it’s clear I want you to have the power, or share the power with him. The trick is, every now and then, he’ll need to feel like he’s the king and able to rule over his country, make certain decisions, and feel important. His queen is softer, more feminine, and uses an emotionally intelligent way to get the king to do what she wants. That’s the problem with women who nag or complain. It makes their boyfriends feel like crap.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Let’s look at a scenario.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Katie wants her guy to do more of the chores in the household (taking out the trash, filling and emptying the dishwasher, buying her flowers, preparing some meals, etc.). She has the option to nag, “Why don’t you ever cook for us? Why don’t you empty the dishwasher? Why am I always the one who _______?” This might work in the short term, but it never ever will work in the long term.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Katie’s boyfriend will feel like a loser because she continuously tells him he is! He’s not good enough for her, clearly. That’s what his ego will conclude. Can you blame it? She’s always talking down to it. He never does anything right.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Katie, however, also has another option. One night he </span><span class="calibre17">does</span><span class="calibre3"> take out the trash. When he walks back into the house she says, “I love it when you take out the trash.” After he cooked something (even though he really has to learn how to combine flavors) she says, “It was a delicious meal. I love it when a man knows how to cook.” You guessed it. These are ego-strokes. Like a puppy, every man’s ego loves to be stroked...and wants more of it.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">As a result, his ego will think, “hmmm...let’s take out the trash more!” or “Let’s look up some recipes online and try to impress her even more the next time.” You may think I’m kidding, but I’m not. This works! Many studies have been done to confirm this. Harvard Business Review wrote an article</span><a id="_ftnref2"></a><a href="part0000_split_039.html#_ftn2"><span class="calibre22">[2]</span></a><span class="calibre3"> stating that the ideal praise to criticism ratio in relationships is 5 to 1—five positive comments for every negative one. John Gottman, the famous researcher from the Gottman Institute who started studying couples in the 1970s in his research lab, found that for people who end up in divorce, the ratio is 0.77 to 1. This means three positive comments for every four negative ones.</span><a id="_ftnref3"></a><a href="part0000_split_039.html#_ftn3"><span class="calibre22">[3]</span></a> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nagging is the worst way to get a man to do anything, and </span><span class="calibre17">the</span><span class="calibre3"> best way to push a relationship over the cliff. If he does anything you don’t like or refrains from doing stuff you like, you should never ever simply accept it. You deserve the best!</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">Nevertheless, don’t nag or complain to get it. Reinforce good behavior and or ignore him when he shows bad behavior. Ignoring his ego (by ignoring him) will hurt and work much better than complaining.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">His ego wants to be in your good graces. It wants to protect you, care for you, and be your man. When a man loves you, all he wants to do is to protect and to serve. Let him.</span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3"> </span> </p> 
   <p class="calibre2"> <span class="calibre3">One important remark, don’t overdo it! Anything available in abundance loses all of its value. Never over-compliment him. Spoon-feed your ego strokes and compliments, so it always remains a challenge to get them. He has to earn them. </span><span class="calibre17">He wants to earn them!</span> </p>
