<p class="noindent_para"><span class="stickupcap">E</span>veryone experiences hard times, no matter how perfect their life might look.</p>
<p class="indent_para">As children, when life gets tough, we can avoid everyday responsibilities and healthily escape into our own heads more easily than we can as adults. But when we reach adulthood, we’re forced to deal with life in all its rawness, and with all the (often painful!) awareness and insight that this stage of our life brings.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Many years ago I lived in Dublin, and ‘What’s the story?’ was a common greeting, in place of ‘Hello’ or ‘How’s it going?’ Of course, no one ever expected a full blow-by-blow account of whatever your story was that day. But it was polite to ask all the same. I love this greeting because it shows a genuine interest in the other person, <span aria-label="page 34. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_34" role="doc-pagebreak"/>or at least an acknowledgement of their story in that moment.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Today I ask a similar question: ‘What’s your story?’ Your story will have many hidden treasures that help you understand who you are and how you can live a fuller life.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Threaded throughout your story will be darkness and light, failure and success, loss and redemption, hopelessness and hope. All are part of life’s rich tapestry. But the problem is that the tougher experiences stick to us like glue and longer term can create mood fluctuations, anxiety and issues with our day-to-day functioning.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I want to teach you how to handle these challenges and navigate your way around life’s everyday ups and downs using daily self-therapy.</p>
<p class="indent_para">But before I embark upon the journey of teaching you to become your own therapist, we need to do the groundwork. I know it’s a pain and you might be thinking, ‘Just give me the solutions.’ But the truth is, <i>you</i> are the solution, which is why we need to start with your story. <i>Because your story matters and it’s worth telling</i>.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Telling your story will help you connect what went on in your life with the person you are today. The events of your life are like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. <span aria-label="page 35. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_35" role="doc-pagebreak"/>As you begin to fit the pieces together, you eventually reach a point where you can see the whole picture. That whole picture represents all there is to know about who you are, and why you are that way. For example, a child who has been left alone a lot by their parents may develop a fear of abandonment in adulthood. The self-awareness that comes from telling your story – putting together the pieces of the jigsaw – is the essence of therapy. That self-awareness will help you feel safer, calmer and more at ease when you’re feeling down, or scared, or out of control. It will also help you bounce back quicker.</p>
<p class="indent_para">The story of your life will lead you to your ‘Aha!’ moments. These are moments of sudden insight. Believe it or not, your story is your power. While you can’t change it, you can salvage strength and wisdom from it. All of it, even the messy parts. I believe no therapy or self-help can truly help you until you come to terms with your story and accept it for what it is rather than what you wanted it to be.</p>
<p class="indent_para">But that’s not enough. It’s also important to tell your story to other people. That’s where the empowerment lies. When you find the courage to tell your story, you are also saying that you are no longer ashamed of it. And that’s life-changing.</p>
<p class="indent_para">So I’d love to invite you, maybe for the first time ever, to tell your story.</p>
<div><span aria-label="page 36. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_36" role="doc-pagebreak"/></div>
<div class="page">
<p class="chap_h3">A CAUTIONARY NOTE</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Before we get into the nitty gritty of this part of the process, you will likely have tried-and-tested methods of dealing with questions around your life. Maybe you have a selection of rehearsed versions of your story, each serving a different purpose, that you roll out as the situation requires.</p>
<p class="indent_para">It might be that you unconsciously employ some clever psychological tricks to either avoid telling your story or to change it to something more acceptable or appropriate:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" epub:type="daisy:pullquote" role="doc-pullquote">
<p class="extract"><span class="gray-color"><b>Denial</b></span>, where you don’t want to accept what’s happened to you. This might sound like, ‘It was all OK.’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span class="gray-color"><b>Minimising</b></span>, where you downplay an experience that had a significant effect on you in order to avoid the pain caused by that experience. This might sound like, ‘I guess it could have been worse.’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span class="gray-color"><b>Catastrophising</b></span>, where you exaggerate the negative aspects of your experience because you need your suffering to be acknowledged by someone else. This might sound like, ‘It was all awful.’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span aria-label="page 37. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_37" role="doc-pagebreak"/><span class="gray-color"><b>Ruminating</b></span>, where you (mistakenly) believe that the more you think about aspects of your story, the more it’ll help you. This might sound like, ‘There was this time and another time, and then this other time…’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span class="gray-color"><b>Dissociation</b></span>, where you treat your story as if it were someone else’s, or refuse to engage with it to avoid the pain caused by your story. This might sound like, ‘I don’t remember much.’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span class="gray-color"><b>Avoidance</b></span>, where it’s easier for you to avoid talking about your story as it makes you uneasy. This might sound like, ‘I don’t like talking about this.’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span class="gray-color"><b>Fantasising</b></span>, where you want to pretend either that something happened in your life that didn’t, or that something didn’t happen in your life that did. This might sound like, ‘It was all absolutely wonderful.’</p>
<p class="extract_ts"><span class="gray-color"><b>Repressing</b></span>, where you bury a memory in the hope that it will go away. This might sound like, ‘I’d rather focus on the future and not talk about this.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent_para"><span aria-label="page 38. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_38" role="doc-pagebreak"/>If you feel yourself falling into the trap of employing these tricks or telling the rehearsed versions of your story, gently stop wherever you are during the process, rewind, then start your story again without judgement.</p>
<p class="indent_para">When I first went to therapy in my early twenties, I thought I was pretty ‘sorted’. It might even have appeared that way to those around me. I was about to come out as gay and I thought talking to someone beforehand seemed like a sensible idea. In the first session, I started to tell my story to the therapist in a very mechanical, rehearsed way. It was all fine. I was fine. My life was fine. My family were fine. Everything was fine, fine, fine! The therapist paused and very calmly, said to me, ‘You tell me you’re fine, but you look a little sad.’ And that was the end of being fine. I suddenly found myself crying and we started the session again. Of course, I wasn’t fine, and it was time to stop pretending. Not only was this a relief but it was also the beginning of a new understanding of myself that I would never have discovered alone. Who would have thought Mr Fine had got it so wrong for so many years?</p>
<div><span aria-label="page 39. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_39" role="doc-pagebreak"/></div></div>
<div class="page">
<p class="chap_h2"><b>WHERE DO I START?</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">This is a common question when I ask clients to tell me their story. First of all, I never ask for a detailed account of someone’s life because I believe it can encourage rumination (deep thinking that can keep us stuck). Instead, I prefer a movie trailer version simply because I get more focus and less digression that way.</p>
<p class="indent_para">This ‘movie trailer version’ is achieved by a process called a <span class="gray-color"><b>timeline</b></span>, which happens in four stages:</p>
<ol class="order-gray1" epub:type="daisy:orderedlist">
<li class="num-g1">Writing a first draft of your timeline (i.e. your life story)</li>
<li class="num-g1">Second edition: the rewrite</li>
<li class="num-g1">Third edition: how did that feel?</li>
<li class="num-g1">Sharing your story with someone who will respect its richness</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent_para">This structure will help you stay focused on the important aspects of your story and hopefully make this a cathartic experience for you. I am encouraging you to tell your story in a new way so that you can begin to assess it rationally from the outside. Sometimes we can get so emotionally invested in the way we’re telling our story, rather than the story itself, that we can’t step back and assess what’s happened in a balanced, <span aria-label="page 40. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_40" role="doc-pagebreak"/>logical way. Likewise, it’s not uncommon to completely disconnect from your story or talk about it as if it happened to someone else.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I once treated a 21-year-old client who, when I asked them to write their timeline, returned with a blank page saying they couldn’t recall anything in their life worth recording. While I was aware this wasn’t true, the blank page indicated that there was a lot to work on here, and it acted as a good starting point. A way in. It truly represented the sense of emptiness and disconnection they felt when they thought about their life.</p>
<p class="indent_para">However, unlike this client, <i>you’re</i> being your own therapist here, so it’s important that you invest time in doing the work. This part of the process is where the gold is, so the more effort you put in, the more you’ll get out of it.</p>
<div><span aria-label="page 41. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_41" role="doc-pagebreak"/></div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p class="chap_h2"><b>STAGE 1</b></p>
<p class="chap_h3_1">WRITING A FIRST DRAFT OF YOUR TIMELINE (I.E. YOUR LIFE STORY)</p>
<p class="noindent_para">The only person qualified to write your story is you. No one else can accurately describe what it has been like to live your life. While other people may be able to talk about the events of your life that they’re aware of, no one else knows about all the private conversations, the quiet shared moments, or even which events have had the biggest impact on you. You are the expert on your story, so it needs to be told by you, and you alone, completely unedited, warts and all.</p>
<p class="indent_para">It’s entirely your decision how you decide to capture your story. Most people opt to write it down, but over the years I’ve seen drawings, paintings, poetry, songs and even a mini film! It doesn’t matter which method you choose. The important point is that the story gets told.</p>
<p class="indent_para">When recollecting the events of your life, I suggest you block out a few hours and go somewhere private where you won’t be interrupted. Try to consider this exercise as an important event, almost like turning up for a big meeting that could have life-changing consequences. <span aria-label="page 42. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_42" role="doc-pagebreak"/>I suggest you choose a place that is comfortable and calming for you. Don’t try to do this while the dog is jumping on you or when you’re cooking dinner. This is your opportunity to carry out a piece of work that could have a powerful, positive impact on your life. You need to give it your undivided time and attention.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If at any point while you’re writing down your story it becomes too distressing, then you can stop for a break and come back when you’re ready. If you have concerns that it is simply going to be too difficult to do alone then you can always seek the guidance of a professional therapist. While the process may be uncomfortable in parts, it’s worth considering that anything worthwhile is rarely easy.</p>
<p class="indent_para">As I am guiding you through the process, I am going to use the writing method, but you can amend as needed if you decide to go down one of the other routes.</p>
<p class="indent_para">How about an example before we start? Let’s say you’re 40 years old. You want to be reflecting over all the key events in your life to date, from infancy to the present. I suggest you approach the timeline in blocks of about ten years. For example, ages 0-9, 10-19, 20-29 and 30-40.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If you are unable to recall specific memories from a young age, that’s OK. There may be family stories that involve you, <span aria-label="page 43. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_43" role="doc-pagebreak"/>but if you can’t recall the memory, don’t force it. This must be <i>your</i> account.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Here’s an example of what a timeline might look like:</p>
<div class="full-90"><img alt="No image description" src="../images/f0043-01.jpg"/></div>
<p class="noindent_para">First, you’re going to list all the happy, joyful, celebratory or positive events and periods in your life at the top of each box. This might be winning an award, the beginning of a new relationship and falling in love, landing a job or doing well in an exam, a wonderful holiday, a time when all your hard work paid off, an amazing party - anything that felt life-affirming. I strongly encourage you not to overthink or analyse what comes up. Simply allow the memory to surface and jot it down without judgement. Non-judgement and honesty are key here.</p>
<p class="indent_para"><span aria-label="page 44. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_44" role="doc-pagebreak"/>In a separate box you’re going to do the same thing, but this time focusing on the sad, difficult and negative memories. This could be a break-up, a bereavement, losing a job, failing at something, being bullied, illness, or something you’re ashamed of having done. Inevitably, you’ll be revisiting some uncomfortable memories that will make this part of the process more difficult. This is 100 per cent normal, so please try not to panic if it doesn’t ‘feel good’. Therapy can be challenging. Allowing yourself to access some of the darker parts of your experience will lead to growth. Or, as I sometimes like to say, crops can’t grow without crap!</p>
<p class="indent_para">Whether a negative or positive memory, keep in mind that other people’s opinions don’t matter. For instance, if a memory comes up that, for whatever reason evokes particular associations, perhaps you were sad when a younger sibling came along, or happy when a mean grandparent died, note it down. Allow it to be as it is, and not how you think others think it should be.</p>
<div><span aria-label="page 45. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_45" role="doc-pagebreak"/></div>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p class="chap_h2"><b>STAGE 2</b></p>
<p class="chap_h3_1">SECOND EDITION: THE REWRITE</p>
<p class="noindent_para">Once you’ve completed your first draft, I suggest you step away from the timeline for a day or two. Your brain will be processing all the old memories you’ve dredged to the surface, and some new ones might emerge.</p>
<p class="indent_para">After you’ve taken a couple of days, reread your timeline with these questions in mind:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" epub:type="daisy:unorderedlist">
<li class="bull1">Does this read as a true, raw, authentic version of my story?</li>
<li class="bull1">Does it capture the moments of struggle and pain?</li>
<li class="bull1">Have I sugar-coated some of the details or left events out?</li>
<li class="bull1">Have I been brutally honest with myself?</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent_para">Are these questions making you reconsider what you’ve written? Are there any memories you missed the first time around or any gaps you need to fill? Does the order of events need tweaking? If so, feel free to edit your timeline (bearing in mind, before you do, that it’s also fine to keep hold of a copy of your original timeline, <span aria-label="page 46. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_46" role="doc-pagebreak"/>if you’d like to. It might be interesting to see how the story has changed.)</p>
<p class="indent_para">If some of your reflections don’t fit neatly into the timeline, make a separate set of notes and put them in a safe place to revisit if you need to.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<p class="chap_h2"><b>STAGE 3</b></p>
<p class="chap_h3_1">THIRD EDITION: HOW DID THAT FEEL?</p>
<p class="noindent_para">So far, we’ve focused on the details of your story. But this is about learning to become your own therapist. So – you knew it was coming! – we need to talk about those tricky feelings, too.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Before we go any further, I want to add a note here about feelings. Many of us think that we should be experiencing ‘positive’ feelings all the time, and that ‘negative’ feelings are a sign that something’s wrong. This is partly because good feelings feel better and partly because we’re constantly being told that we should have a positive mindset by social, online and print media and commercial advertisers. But feeling good isn’t possible all the time, because a life lived fully will always have difficult periods with plenty of negative emotions and moments upon which we can reflect and learn. <span aria-label="page 47. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_47" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And these negative emotions serve a purpose, just as your positive emotions do. In fact, I like to think of our feelings as barometers, signposts back to steadiness. Life is a mixed bag of emotional experiences and that’s how it’s supposed to be. How can we appreciate the good times if we have no experience of the tough times?</p>
<p class="indent_para">In short, <i>all</i> emotions are trying to help and guide you. Rather than categorise them as ‘good’ and ‘bad’, instead try to welcome them and see them as interesting. It’s incredibly liberating.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Let’s bring this back to your timeline. It’s worth pondering what feelings came up for you when you reflected on the events in the story of your life – both the first and the second edition. Perhaps some reactions surprised you or maybe there were moments when you didn’t feel what you expected to feel. Keep a note, maybe with a different colour pen, of the feelings that emerged when recalling your important life events. I encourage you to be curious about this array of emotions that will surround the important points of your life. If you can’t access these emotions for whatever reason, that’s OK, so long as it helps you realise something about yourself – perhaps that you disconnect from certain feelings. Or maybe it’s hard to label some of your feelings, which is OK too, <span aria-label="page 48. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_48" role="doc-pagebreak"/>but that’s something worth working on.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Remember, at this stage you’re not trying to do anything with the feelings, you’re just discovering what’s there and allowing yourself to feel. Underneath the feeling there might be some new information or an ‘Aha!’ moment. But don’t try to force it, just allow it to come naturally.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I remember doing this exercise in my own therapy and uncovering something interesting. I recalled a memory as a young teenager when I got homesick on a school trip. I was very upset about being away from home, and this meant that a teacher had to drive me back to my parents. When I explored my emotions surrounding this event, I noticed that I felt embarrassed and ashamed when I’d previously thought I had just been anxious about being away. These emotions taught me my concern was about disappointing my parents, leading to a sense of embarrassment and shame. Fast forward a few years and I realised that this one seemingly trivial event contributed to me developing a belief that I needed to always see things through to avoid embarrassment or shame.</p>
<p class="indent_para">It’s fascinating what these feelings can teach us if we allow them to. We will talk more about what you can learn from your emotional responses to past events in <a href="9780008378288_Chapter03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a> when we roadmap your story. <span aria-label="page 49. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_49" role="doc-pagebreak"/>But for now, being aware of the feelings, and asking the question, ‘I wonder what that’s about?’ are enough. The awareness will come.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I strongly discourage you from over-thinking, over-analysing or excessively ruminating on the events of the past, or your emotional responses, during this exercise. Some memories will hold more weight than others. Some reactions won’t make sense. A happy memory might evoke a sad emotion. A difficult memory might evoke a series of emotions or even a sense of numbness. There is no right or wrong response. Your emotions are what they are. But they will teach you something about who you are and how you respond to life. I can guarantee that.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Alongside documenting your responses to specific past events, it might also be useful to reflect on how the overall experience of devising your timeline made you feel. Here are some common responses I often hear:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" epub:type="daisy:unorderedlist">
<li class="bull1">I thoroughly enjoyed it</li>
<li class="bull1">It was tough</li>
<li class="bull1">I tried to avoid it</li>
<li class="bull1">I kept putting it off</li>
<li class="bull1">I was keen to finish it quickly</li>
<li class="bull1"><span aria-label="page 50. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_50" role="doc-pagebreak"/>I was hoping to avoid my past</li>
<li class="bull1">It was incredibly surprising</li>
<li class="bull1">I had buried so many memories</li>
<li class="bull1">I had forgotten many of the nice times</li>
<li class="bull1">It was emotional</li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent_para">Your experience of sitting down to create your timeline can be as revealing as your emotional responses to events. So you know, I felt a little irritated when I did mine because I was facing aspects of my life I had avoided for a long time. The irritation told me much about my avoidance. I realised I sometimes try to dodge facing up to the uncomfortable stuff in my life.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Your own feelings during this exercise may not make as much sense to you right now, and that’s completely OK. We’re going to work on that part of the process in <a href="9780008378288_Chapter03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a> when you ‘map out’ your story and link it to your current life.</p>

<p class="chap_h2"><b>STAGE 4</b></p>
<p class="chap_h3_1">SHARING YOUR STORY WITH SOMEONE WHO WILL RESPECT ITS RICHNESS</p>
<p class="noindent_para">There is an expression, ‘everyone has a book in them.’ And I believe this is true. Everyone has a story to tell that is completely unique to them. And I think it’s deeply important that everyone has an opportunity to tell their story. When you tell your story, you are seen, heard and hopefully validated.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I worked in palliative care for many years and I would occasionally meet people close to death who’d never had the opportunity to tell their story. Sometimes, they would share it with me. These moments were golden. It was a privilege to listen. Watching their eyes brighten and dim as they journeyed through their life was incredibly moving. I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard a dying person say:</p>
<ul class="bullet1" epub:type="daisy:unorderedlist">
<li class="bull1">It’s a relief to tell someone this</li>
<li class="bull1">I’m glad someone knows this</li>
<li class="bull1">Thanks for listening to me</li>

</ul>
<p class="noindent_para"><span aria-label="page 52. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_52" role="doc-pagebreak"/>And that sense of a weight being lifted was tangible with almost every story.</p>
<p class="indent_para">You have an opportunity now to tell your story in all its fullness and glory while you’re alive. You don’t have to wait until the end of your life, or worse, never tell your story at all. And the time is now because ultimately now is all we have. Tomorrow is guaranteed to no one.</p>

<div class="page">
<p class="chap_h2"><b>HOW TO TELL YOUR STORY</b></p>
<p class="noindent_para">I’m going to avoid being overly prescriptive here because <i>you</i> will know how to tell your story best, simply because it’s yours. There is no person better placed than you.</p>
<p class="indent_para">All I’m going to do here is share a few tips that should help you get as much as possible out of this experience.</p>
<p class="indent_para">First, choose someone you’re comfortable with. Explain to them that you have been creating a timeline of your life. When I’m working with a client, I always suggest they find someone they consider a genuine <span class="gray-color"><b>pal</b></span>. They are usually someone who is:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote" epub:type="daisy:pullquote" role="doc-pullquote">
<p class="extract"><span aria-label="page 53. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_53" role="doc-pagebreak"/><b>P: Present</b></p>
<p class="extract"><b>A: Accepting</b></p>
<p class="extract"><b>L: Loving</b></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent_para">Avoid the friend or family member that interrupts, judges, interjects with their own stories or shows any sign of disrespect for your story.</p>
<p class="indent_para">I will say here that if any of the content of your story is highly distressing or traumatic, please don’t hesitate to seek advice from your doctor or a mental health professional. Most issues can be handled within personal networks, but it is good to be mindful that sometimes professional interventions are important and essential.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Find a location that’s quiet and private. A pub or nightclub may not be the best choice for this one! Then it’s over to you. Share your timeline with someone and give them the gift of your story unapologetically and honestly. Remember, you are showing up, lowering your defences and letting someone see you <i>as you truly are</i>, without any of the social armour we all use to protect us. This takes enormous courage. You are courageous.</p>
<p class="indent_para">As you tell your story, try to avoid digressing or allowing the listener to ‘therapise’ you as you talk. Allow the story to flow naturally. Let the emotions rise, <span aria-label="page 54. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_54" role="doc-pagebreak"/>pause when you need to, breathe, smile, cry and take pride in your steps towards transformation.</p>
<p class="indent_para">When this part of the work is completed, the next step is salvaging what you can from your story. This is the ‘mapping out’ stage and the beginning of what will, in time, develop into a much fuller understanding of who you are and why you are this way. More on this in <a href="9780008378288_Chapter03.xhtml#ch3">Chapter 3</a>.</p>

" epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_55" role="doc-pagebreak"/>and I assured him of that.</p>
<p class="indent_para">After the initial introductory session, we explored his timeline, which he resented doing. He said he felt irritated as he wanted therapy to make him ‘happy’, not upset. But naturally, the timeline was instrumental in helping us make sense of his struggle.</p>
<p class="indent_para">He came from a loving family who did their best by him, and he didn’t identify any major traumas in his life. There were of course highs and lows, heartaches, break-ups and some difficult times. However, one key period in his life generated a huge reaction on his timeline.</p>
<p class="indent_para">Nigel was sent to private school aged 11. His parents believed it would be good for him, but he was unhappy as his friends had gone to school locally. He never told them as he feared they would be disappointed. He wanted to go to a drama school, but knew it wasn’t something his parents wanted for him. It set in motion a sense of failure.</p>
<p class="indent_para">He recounted a sense of dread he always felt on Sundays. This Sunday-night dread never left, and it was during therapy we discovered that his corporate job was an extension of school. He didn’t want to be there, and he wasn’t living the life he wanted. His anxiety was now making sense to him.</p>
<p class="indent_para"><span aria-label="page 56. " epub:type="pagebreak" id="page_56" role="doc-pagebreak"/>Nigel also discovered that he’d felt unheard when he was sent to private school. As an adult he could see his parents were doing what they thought was best for him, but as a teenager he’d felt unheard by them. This had led to Nigel being mistrustful of people who wanted to get close to him. He described deliberately sabotaging a romantic relationship to avoid rejection. This mistrust in people had never been resolved.</p>
<p class="indent_para">If Nigel hadn’t found the courage to tell his story, we would never have figured out the core reason behind his struggles. His anxiety, relationship issues and feelings of failure all made perfect sense now. Nigel was subsequently able to focus on unlearning his unhelpful beliefs around trust, himself and other people.</p>
