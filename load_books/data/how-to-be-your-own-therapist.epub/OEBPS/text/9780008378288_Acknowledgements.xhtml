<p class="noindent_para"><span class="stickupcap">I</span> must thank my agent Bev James and her team for their continued support and enthusiasm. Likewise, the incredible team at my publisher HQ, HarperCollins. I also had the joy of working with Rachel Kenny as my editor again. She is simply brilliant. And to every client who has trusted me with their story, thank you. Everyone else, you know who you are.</p>
