	<string>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The highest-rated dating self-help book on Amazon 74 weeks running, from July 2011 to Dec 2012, according to readers -- 4.8/5.0 stars. What they have to say:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I have read many books about relationships and dating, but &lt;em&gt;The Tao of Dating&lt;/em&gt; is one of a kind, so different and mind-blowing in its common sense and simplicity that it is impossible to put it down once you start reading.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'Well, where shall I start? Mind blowing? Life-changing? Truly opened my eyes? No words can express how much I love this book. I wish I had read it much earlier.' &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'I keep this book in a small, carefully chosen, boxed collection of 'indispensable advice I wish I had written' that I will pass along to my children as they navigate through teens, twenties, early adulthood and beyond.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'This turned out to be one of the most transformative books I have ever read much more so than I thought it possibly could be.' &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'The content is intelligent and compassionate and enriching far beyond anything to do with dating. In essence, this book somehow, magically, alchemically, brings you back to yourself. Everyday TV and other media specialize in portraying women as cheap and disposable. This book is the antidote. Just by reading it, one is restored to one's own heart. I can think of no better praise.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;'1.5 reads of the book in and I can honestly say that I not only have a clear sense of the basic things that I was doing that were completely throwing off the dynamic with these men, but that I now have simple, quite beautiful little tools in mind when I'm interacting with men that make me properly excited to date. I'll admit that I bought a few books in this vein in one lump...but 'The Tao of Dating' just completely blew them out of the water.' &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'This is the most helpful dating book that I have experienced! At the time of my purchase I also downloaded two other books and after reading this I can't even get through the first chapter of the other ones.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'Thanks to this specific book, I went from having a nonexistent dating life, with empty weeks stretching ahead to being booked every night of the week and in some cases, having two or three dates per evening... the results, for me, were dramatic: I now feel like I have my pick of the litter a slew of fabulous guys who all clamor for my attention.' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAN YOU HAVE IT ALL?&lt;br&gt;I believe that smart, successful women &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; have it all -- both a great career AND a rich, warm, fulfilling love life.&lt;/strong&gt; If you agree, read on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an advisor at Harvard, I noticed that smart women like yourself were having unfulfilling love lives on an epidemic scale. They either couldn't find the right guy, were with the wrong guy, had relationships that didn't last, or had given up on dating entirely. So I wrote this book to remedy the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is not your grandma's dating guide. Partially because I'm not your grandma, and partially because the 21st century poses unprecedented challenges to the modern woman. With a high-powered career, sometimes it seems that there just isn't time for love, and nowadays lots of guys are less educated &amp;amp; affluent than you. What to do? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book combines ancient wisdom with modern science to give smart, successful women like yourself a heart-centered, science-based, practical guide to finding fulfillment in your love lives -- and far beyond. I give it all to you in a progression of small, easy steps that put the fun back in dating, plus the science and reasoning behind it so you can trust where it all comes from. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click on the 'Read first chapter FREE' button above and to the right, or use the 'Click to look inside' button to read the full table of contents, Introduction &amp;amp; Chapter 1. Juicy topics from the book in the 'Author Bio' below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</string>
