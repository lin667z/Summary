Eliot, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Four Quartets, </span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Part 4</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">When I was seven years old, I had my first crush.  Her name was Leila Clark and she was in my second grade class.  She was absolutely adorable, so I did nice little things for her whenever possible.  Silly little things, like sharing with her one of my home-baked cookies, or letting her cut in front of me in the lunch line.  I thought about her all the time and wanted to be her friend so badly and to play with her, but she always remained a bit aloof.  I figured maybe she wasn’t so into me.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              But I was not about to be deterred, so I invited her to my birthday party.  Mind you, for a seven year old boy, his eighth birthday party is the very pinnacle of his earthly existence. I was dying for her to come.  So I asked, “Leila, wanna come to my birthday party?”  She turned around and said, “NO!”</p><p class="calibre_5">And that was that.  It was the year that I got skipped from second grade to the third grade, so soon Leila was out of my class.  I never saw her again.  </p><p class="calibre_5">That was over 25 years ago.  Now I don’t know exactly what would have happened if Leila had said yes on that fateful day.  Maybe I still would not have had my first kiss until age 19.  Maybe I would not have been scared of girls and utterly mystified by them for the first two decades of my life.  But I’ll tell you this: on that day, Leila had the power to crown me or crush my little heart.  And if she had said yes, maybe, just maybe a little more joy would have been added to the world’s storehouses.</p><p class="calibre_5">I thought of Leila every once in a while – what did she look like now, where did she end up, what was she doing – and in idle moments, enlisted my good friend Google to see if anything turned up, which never did.  I mean, she’s probably married with 2.3 kids – who knows what her last name is now?   </p><p class="calibre_5">Then came… The Letter.  </p><p class="calibre_5">It popped up in my Facebook account: “Are you the same Ali from my second grade class?”  Holy cow.  I rubbed my eyes.  The sender’s name was Leila Clark, and she had an uncanny resemblance to the Leila from second grade – cute little birthmark and all.  She was married, a doctor, living in New York, and apparently very pleased to have found me.  </p><p class="calibre_5">So of course, I had to ask her: did she turn me down cold for my eighth birthday party because she didn’t like me, or did she actually like me and said no for a different reason?  What she wrote back almost broke my heart: “I always liked you, Ali.  I just didn’t know what to do – I was just a shy little 8-yr old myself!  And you were so intimidating!”  Intimidating!  At eight!  I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.  </p><p class="calibre_5">It’s true – nobody had taught us what to do then.  And the tragedy is that most people go through their entire lives never learning what to do when it comes to one of the most important skills in life: connecting meaningfully with another human being.  Heaven knows how much deprivation and unrequited love has happened as a result.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">A gentle reminder</span></p><p class="calibre_5">I’ve written this book in part to remind you of the power that you already have as a woman.  With a single word, you can crown a man the king of the world or crush his dreams.  Recognize that you have that power, and use it with compassion towards him and yourself.  From Chapter 67 of the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span>:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">I have three treasures to keep and hold:</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Compassion, economy and humility.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">From compassion comes courage.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">From economy comes generosity.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">From humility comes leadership and true power.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              – Lao Tzu, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Tao Te Ching</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">, Ch. 67</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              To re-cognize is to see again something that's always been there.  And by now, you may have realized that this book is about something more than just dating.  It's about recognizing and revealing your inner light to the world.  It's about acknowledging yourself as the one-of-a-kind miracle that you are and recognizing that you are a blessing to the planet.  It's about recognizing that you are here to experience bliss every glorious day you spend on Earth and to share that with others.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Once you are glowing with bliss, shining your inner light and just plain feeling amazing, the rest has no choice but to fall into place.  This is the essence of <span class="italic">wu-wei</span>, not-doing.  There will be no more struggle.  There will be no more overthinking.  There will just be you, as in Chapter 3 of the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span>:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Practice not-doing,</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">and everything will fall into place.</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              This book is about reminding you of who you really are.  You are beauty.  You are kindness.  You are joy.  You are the embodiment of the divine goddess.  It’s also about reminding you that full effort is full victory.  And if you’ve read this book and found your way to your own inner kindness, joy, and divinity, then you have found fulfillment.  As we said in Chapter 2, <span class="italic">the work is the wealth</span>.  Sure, a decent guy would be icing on the cake.  But you already possess the cake, and it is you.  And if you want someone with whom to share the love, remember this from Williamson:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And when a woman remembers her glory, a man of goodwill can barely contain his joy.  His real self arises in the presence of her own.  I'm telling you, it works, this thing, this looking within to attract what is without.  Make room for love, and it always comes.  Make a nest for love, and it always settles.  Make a home for the beloved, and he will find his way there. </span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> – </span></span><span class="calibre_9">A Woman’s Worth</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">, p. 75</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
