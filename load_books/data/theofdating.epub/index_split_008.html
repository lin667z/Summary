<p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Chapter 1. Dating for Fulfillment</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Which would you prefer: the menu or the food?</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Imagine that you’re hungry right now at a diner.  And they offer you just the menu but no food.  Would you settle for that?  Or would you demand actual food?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              That may seem like a silly question.  But in real life, people sometimes operate as if they aren't sure about the answer.  They chase down the symbol representing what we want – money, titles – instead of the actual thing that we want.  But the money and the titles are only as good as the feelings and experiences they can get for us.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So while reading this book, I'd like you to keep in mind what constitutes real fulfillment for you in the dating realm – the actual food, not the menu.  Because fulfillment is not a person – it's a feeling.  The right person is the one who catalyzes an abundance of fulfilling feelings in your life, like love, peace and contentment.  If you're not getting those feelings, it may be a sign that you're either with the wrong person or that you could approach matters with an even better perspective.</p><p class="calibre_2">              </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Square one: accept and love yourself now</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Some argue that the ultimate aim of everything we do in life is to get more love.  You could be reading this book because you want more love from men, more love from your friends, or more love from yourself.  Of those three, only one is directly under your control – the love you have for yourself.  Generally speaking, being better with men won’t make your friends like you any better (and sometimes may have the opposite effect).  And chances are that if you are not happy with yourself right now, no amount of success with men will ever make up for that.  And no man will be able to trigger feelings of fulfillment in you.</p><p class="calibre_5">              In fact, it only gets harder when you <span class="italic">have</span> what you <span class="italic">thought</span> would make you happy and still find happiness elusive.  So go ahead and decide<span class="italic"> now</span> to be comfortable in your own skin and to accept yourself exactly as you are.  Why?  Besides being a good starting point, there is no time when it’s not right now.  Now is the only time.  And true fulfillment can only come from sharing your joy, contentment and self-sufficiency with the rest of the world in the present moment.  Decide it, claim it, be it.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Be content with what you have and who you are</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And you cannot be harmed.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">                            – Lao Tzu, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Tao Te Ching,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> Ch. 44</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5">So if you’re perfectly okay right where you are, why would you need this book?  Great question.  It reminds me of an old Buddhist saying: “We are perfect as we are, and we could all use a little work.”  </p><p class="calibre_5">Here's one way to think about it.  Seeking out resources for self-improvement simply means that you are on a journey of growth.  And in order to reach your goals in dating – or anything else in life – it's important to believe that at every point along this journey of growth, you are complete.  A sequoia seedling is always a sequoia at every point along its path to becoming a towering tree.  And so are you always an empowered, fulfilled woman on your way to even greater empowerment and fulfillment.  You are always turning into the best possible version of you.</p><p class="calibre_5">               This is important because the world tends to be a reflection of your dominant thoughts.  When you signal to the world "I am okay," the world will agree with you.  When you signal “Well, I’ll be okay if I just get this little part fixed, but I’m not quite okay right now,” then the world will agree with you also.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Recognize that whatever mindset you have right now is the one you're likely to carry with you for the rest of your life.  If you don't think you're okay right now, chances are that no events or circumstances will change that.  Thus I encourage you to choose right now to adopt the mindset that, wherever you are, regardless of your real or imagined inadequacies, you accept yourself just as you are.  Stop the struggle and just be.  Chapter 29 of the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span> puts it thus:</p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> </span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Those who try to fix the world fail. </span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">The world is sacred; it can't be improved.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Those who tamper with it harm it.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Those who grasp at it lose it.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">There’s a time for leading,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And a time for following;</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A time for blowing hot,</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And a time for blowing cold;</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A time for motion</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And a time for rest;</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A time for  vigor,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And a time for exhaustion;</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A time for beginning,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And a time for ending..</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">The sage sees things as they are,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And takes the middle path,</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Away from the extremes.</span></span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_8"></div>
