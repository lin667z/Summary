<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Chapter 10. Attract</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">You have an unfair advantage – use it!</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              I have good news for you: you are a lucky woman.  Why?  Because you're a woman!  In the mating dance, men are the pursuers and you the pursued.  And you already possess <span class="italic">all</span> the necessary gifts to attract men into your life.  In fact, you are custom-made to make pretty much any man fall for you.  It's simply a matter of awakening those gifts to bring into your life the kind of man who fulfills you.              </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The three components of attraction</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              I like to think of attraction as happening at three levels: that of head, heart and genitals (or mind, spirit and body).  These correspond to three chakras, or energy centers, from Hindu philosophy (<span class="italic">ajni</span>, <span class="italic">anahata</span> and <span class="italic">swadisthana</span>, respectively).  Ideally, you would want a man with whom you can connect at the level of all three chakras.  Hence, it makes sense to cultivate your attractiveness at each of those levels.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Another reason why it's important to cultivate all three chakras is this: the kind of fish you catch has everything to do with the kind of bait you use.  If you use your sensuality and sexuality as bait, you're likely to end up with a man who's interested only in your body.  If you primarily connect with men intellectually, you may end up with a guy who's great to talk to but isn't compatible with you physically.  And a super-sensitive guy who's all heart may not be all that fun to talk to.</p><p class="calibre_5">              So strike a balance between your head, heart and body and give attention to all three.  All great, lasting relationships will have a strong connection at all three levels.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              What we will emphasize in this chapter is femininity – how to cultivate the yin aspect (or, if we want to be consistent with our Eastern philosophical systems, the <span class="italic">shakti</span> energy) at each of those three chakras.  Since most of the men you encounter will have a masculine essence, they will be attracted to the feminine in you.  The more you practice femininity, the more you will draw men to you like honeybees to a flower.</p><p class="calibre_5">              There lies enormous power in these practices.  If you do them well, you will have the capability to entice any number of men out there.  However, with power comes responsibility, so remember the principle of enlightened self-interest: what's best for you in the <span class="italic">long term</span> tends to be the best course of action right now.  Becoming the temptress that cuts a mile-wide swath of destruction through the hearts of men will likely cause you much inconvenience in the long run. Have fun, and use your powers judiciously.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If some of these practices seem foreign or too feminine and you'd rather reside more in your masculine essence, consider this.  Have you ever met a man who is super-sensitive, indecisive and passive?  Essentially, a man who just struck you as really effeminate?  How attractive did you find that?  How <span class="italic">annoying</span> did you find that?  Rest assured that a man finds an excessively masculine woman just as unappealing.  So in your intimate relations with men, go easy on the masculine energy.  As Williamson said, major in the feminine and minor in the masculine.  We love you because you're a woman, so go ahead and be a woman.  We guys think it's kind of hot.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Attract with your physical presence</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Men are attracted to your radiance.  Now everyone knows radiance when they see it, but what is it exactly?  It's difficult to describe.  My best explanation is that it's life force itself.  People coming out of an exercise class radiate.  Kids radiate.  Animals in the wild radiate.  The kind of radiance you possess as a woman is all of that, and a lot more.  It contains a sexual element, a promise of communion, and the very light of god.  It is what men crave.</p><p class="calibre_5">              If you wish to be radiant, project <span class="italic">sensuality</span>.  Sensuality means engaging with your senses.  Actively see, hear, taste, smell, and most of all, <span class="italic">feel</span>.  When you fully inhabit your body, own your sexuality and feel the full force of your femininity, you radiate.  There is nothing more attractive to a man than a woman in full possession of her femininity.  Just thinking about it makes them swoon. </p><p class="calibre_5">              You can find entire books and seminars devoted to sensuality.  For a quick introduction, I heartily recommend <span class="italic">The Sensuous Woman</span> by "J".  It is a slim volume and very easy to read, and its practices can completely transform your life within the hour or two it takes to read it.  Since "J" wrote the book in 1969, some of its references may seem outdated, but the premise is timeless: when you choose to become a sensuous woman, few men can resist you.  She has 10 sensuality exercises in that book, and you would do well to practice all ten.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The next exercise is inspired by that book.  You can do all of it or as much of it as you have time for.  It's one of the most important, transformative exercises in the whole book, so even if you've skipped all the other exercises so far, <span class="italic">do this one</span>.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 17.  Cultivate your sensuality.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">This exercise works best right before going to bed.  Make your bed with fresh sheets.  Sprinkle it with some perfume or essential oils.  Make sure the room is sufficiently warm.  Prepare some music that you find soothing and romantic.  Turn out the lights and put on some candles.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now go take a bath (or shower, if you don't have access to a tub).  Don't use a washcloth – wash yourself with your bare hands.  Do it slowly, and pay close attention to the sensation of your hands on your body.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              As you soak in the water, pay attention to everything that you hear, see, feel and smell.  How does the water temperature feel on your body?  What does the soap smell like?  How does the sloshing of the water sound?  Really engage with your senses as much as possible.  You'll find that this will clear your thoughts and relax you tremendously.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              When you feel sufficiently relaxed, get out of the bath and blot yourself dry with a towel, gently, slowly, as if you're a priceless jewel.  Now put on the music and get in the fresh sheets (yes, you're still naked).  Notice how they feel on your skin and the smell that they have.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Next, close your eyes and pay attention to your breath.  Imagine that sensuality and pleasure have a color.  What color would that be?  Imagine that you're breathing that color into your lungs with each inhalation.  With each</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">exhalation, breathe that color into your body, starting with your feet.  Breathe two breaths of pleasure into your toes, your sole; then your calves and shins; knees and thighs; buttocks and groin; torso and chest; arms and hands; head and neck.  Wiggle each body part a little as you breathe that pleasurable color into it.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              If you haven't already put on some music, do so now.  Now feel your whole body tingly and energized as a result of breathing into it.  Wiggle all your body parts again and start moving to the music.  Now rise and dance to the music as if you're Salome dancing for King Herod.  If it feels strange to you, then you're doing it right.  Close your eyes and imagine that a throng of men are utterly entranced by looking at you.  Sway, undulate.  Move your hips.  Run your fingertips over your skin.  Let the music move through you like a river of pleasure as you feel your whole body come alive, inside and out.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              When you feel like you are the very shining goddess of sensuality, you can turn off the music, crawl into bed and get some well-deserved, soothing sleep with a big smile on your face.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Have fun while you transform</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              I wrote this book for a simple reason: I want you to win.  I want to see you beaming from ear to ear because you are with the dream guy whose company makes you deliriously happy.  I want to give you advantages that put you head and shoulders above all the other women out there who haven't read this book.  So have fun doing the practices.  You’ll get a lot more out of the book that way, and a real shot at transformation.</p><p class="calibre_5">              You bought this book because you wanted change in your life.  I absolutely know you can do it.  I believe in you.  Your sensuality is like any other skill: you get better at it the more you practice.  So let’s roll up your sleeves and have some fun with this stuff, shall we?  Here are some ideas to get you started on your sensuality practice.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Do  yoga.</span></span>  I have always said that yoga is the single most transformative practice I have taken up as an adult.  It makes your body strong and flexible, it focuses your mind, and it calms your spirit.  It also makes you glow.  Ever seen a group of yogis coming out of a challenging class?  They all look like human beacons.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Of all the forms of exercise I've engaged in, yoga has been the one that has made me most body-aware.  It's a whole-body, whole-mind practice.  So if you don't already do yoga, give it a try.  If you already do yoga, work your way to the most vigorous class and make sure you practice it three times a week; twice at the very minimum.  If you don't have a yoga studio nearby, do it at home by following a recorded program.  I recommend the work of Baron Baptiste.    </p><p class="calibre_5">              If taking yoga classes is simply not in the cards for you, do regular vigorous exercise.  Athletes glow with vitality, and vitality is the same as sexiness.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Dance regularly and take dance classes</span></span><span class="bold">.</span>  So much of modern living is sedentary that people forget that the human body is designed to move.  There is no better way to reconnect with your sensuality than to dance, since it fully engages all five of your senses and takes you out of your head.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Dancing alone is fantastic, but what can truly amplify your sensuality and femininity is partnered dancing.  This type of dancing cultivates the masculine-feminine dynamic as you learn to relax into your partner's lead and really enjoy that.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Specifically feminine forms of dance, such as belly dancing, are also great ways of cultivating feminine sensuality through movement.  As a man, I can tell you that the way a skilled belly dancer moves her hips, undulates, shimmies, gazes coyly and uses her whole body as a symphony of sensuality is irresistible.  A woman who can move like that has enormous power over men.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Notice that all of these practices are their own reward.  Even if taking yoga or dance classes do not bring you a great man, your life will still be richer and more fun because of engaging in them.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Also notice that these practices aren't teaching you anything that you don't already know.  They are merely unveiling the sensuality within.  A story about the Coen Brothers movie <span class="italic">O Brother, Where Art Thou?</span> illustrates this point.  There's a scene in the movie in which three river-sirens are supposed to tempt the three chain-gang men (played by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Nelson).  The women asked Joel Coen, the director, what they should do.  Joel gave them a two-word instruction: "Beckon them."  Apparently, that's all they needed to hear.  If you've viewed the scene, the women undulate, soften their gaze, lower their eyes, tilt their necks, look at the men sideways, push forward their chest, touch themselves strategically and do an altogether fine job of beckoning.  To see for yourself, you can look up that scene online right now.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Do you know how to beckon a man?  Oh yes you do.  The more important question is, when was the last time you used that skill?  And why so long ago?  Use what your mama gave you.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Attract him with your mind</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              You are a smart woman.  How do I know that?  Because you bought this book!  Kidding aside, I wrote this book specifically for smart women like you.  Which is why some of you may find what I'm going to say next a bit challenging.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Remember that attraction is created through <span class="italic">polarity</span> – when you are the yin to his yang.  Therefore one of the most powerful things you can do to attract a man intellectually is to <span class="italic">be receptive</span>.  In other words, draw him out and listen to him.  Because heaven knows men like to talk about their interests.</p><p class="calibre_5">              At the same time, a little bit of feistiness can amplify that polarity.  Have an opinion!  Speak your mind!  Ask questions!  Intellect and talent in a woman are tremendously attractive – in fact, the most appealing aspect of a woman for most of the smart men I know.  So if you're brilliant and have something to say – shine, sister, shine.  Challenging a man and asking probing questions are two of the most potent ways of sparking the attraction between you two.  When you do this in a playful, non-malicious way, you will be head and shoulders above all the other women.  And the smart guys will love you for it.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Well, it sounds like I just gave you two completely conflicting set of instructions.  It's all about balance.  Be wary of what can happen if you were to find yourself competing with a man intellectually, or talking over him, or challenging him.  Because that's when the polarity can get compromised.  And if you're completely passive, that's no fun either.  The Tao is all about following the middle path.  Balance is of the essence. </p><p class="calibre_5">              If sometimes you feel the need to assert yourself to the point that you're trying hard to prove your point with a man, consider this.  It all comes down to what you would rather be: cherished or right.  If you spar with the man, you may end up being right – and alone.  If you'd rather be cherished, then draw him out and listen to him like your life depended on it.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Remember that sometimes it’s okay for the two of you to have different opinions.  This is what my therapist friend Michelle calls <span class="italic">the art of allowing</span>.  You are allowing the man’s opinion to be different from yours.  When you <span class="italic">allow</span> the man to be as he is, you are making a conscious choice and therefore empowering yourself.  In turn, you should seek someone who allows you to be as <span class="italic">you</span> are.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Before we go into the art of listening, a note for the exceptionally smart women out there: never, ever compromise or hide your intelligence for fear of turning off a man who can't handle it.  You need to be you, and the world needs to see you shine.  So you need to find a man who can appreciate your blazing intellect without being intimidated by it.  Although they may be a little tougher to find, there are plenty of brilliant men out there who are looking for someone just like you.  Have the patience to find one of them.<a></a></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The wisdom of paradox</span></p><p class="calibre_5">If some of what we have discussed so far seems a bit counterintuitive, that’s okay.  The wisdom of the Tao is often paradoxical.  Just remember to keep an open mind and try everything out to see how well it works for you – without <span class="italic">a priori</span> judgment as to how things <span class="italic">should</span> work.  Think of it as one big experiment, without any attachment to results.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, the counterintuitive wisdom in what we just discussed is that a mildly contrarian stance – being feisty – can stoke the fires of attraction faster than a blandly acquiescent stance.  The scientific explanation behind it is that mild antagonism causes the secretion of adrenaline, which mediates arousal and rapid attraction (Fisher, 2004).  I don’t necessarily advocate starting a fistfight when you first meet a man (if you do, do me a favor and report back on its effectiveness), but it’s a safe bet that a little feistiness will draw him to you more than just being nice.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The Art of Listening and the Magic Question</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One of the most powerful actions you can take to spark the attraction between you and a man and distinguish yourself from other women is to listen – <span class="italic">really</span> listen.  Nowadays it seems that hardly anyone can finish a sentence before getting interrupted by friends chiming in with their own thoughts.  Not you!  You know how to stay completely silent and <span class="italic">just listen</span> as the man (or anyone else, for that matter) says everything he has to say.  Resist the temptation to say "Oh my god, that same thing totally happened to me!"  Resist the temptation to insert a witty comment, no matter how appropriate it seems.  People are so rarely listened to that if you just do that, the man will think the world of you.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There's an old saying that goes, "Bad conversationalists talk about themselves.  Good conversationalists let you talk.  Great conversationalists talk about <span class="italic">you</span>."  Turns out the best way to be interesting is to be <span class="italic">interested</span>, and just let the guy talk.  Thus, the hidden benefit of listening is that he'll think you're <span class="italic">really</span> interesting.   </p><p class="calibre_5">              Of course, this listening thing may not come naturally.  But neither does championship horseback riding or playing the violin.  Dating is like any other skill, and to get good at it, you practice.  Learning how to listen well is a skill that will hold you in good stead for the rest of your life, so it's well worth honing.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 18.  Listen.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">This is also called the <span class="italic">dyad</span> exercise.  You need a partner to do this one.  The exercise is best done in person.  Tell your partner that you are going to do an exercise in listening.  Now ask your partner "What are you interested in?," and listen to the response.  Look your partner directly in the eye and do not say anything until your partner completely stops talking and signals that it's your turn to speak.  Then say "Thank</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">you," and switch roles. Do this for at least three rounds.  Notice the urges that come up – to interrupt, to chime in with a thought, to offer a word or a sigh of support – and how it feels to just let them go.  After the end of the exercise, ask each other how it felt to be truly listened to.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              That's a tremendously useful exercise, and I really encourage you to try it at least once.  When you do, you'll realize how rare it is for us to let someone else complete a thought and be completely heard out, and how often our own little ideas pop up and want to interrupt.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If you learn to listen well, I promise you will be head and shoulders above every other woman out there – provided that you incorporate the following additional technique into it.  Remember how we said that the great conversationalists talk about <span class="italic">you</span>?  Well, you want to make this conversation about him.  The way you do this is with a simple yet infinitely powerful question that you will ask again and again.  I will call it the Magic Question:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><span class="italic">"What's important to you about that?"</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              If you detect this to be a fancy way of saying <span class="italic">why</span>, you are correct – that's exactly what it is.  However, <span class="italic">why</span> sounds a bit confrontational and judgmental – "Well, why'd you do that?  Why didn't you do something else?"  <span class="italic">What's important to you</span> sounds a lot softer and is much more likely to get useful information.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The key to doing this process enjoyably and effectively is to ask only questions you’re genuinely interested in.  This is not a job interview.  It’s the discovery of another soul – one who could become your lifetime partner!  So cultivate a boundless curiosity for people.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Now each time you ask a person the Magic Question, you will get closer to what really matters to him.  You are getting closer to his core values – what really motivates him and makes his life meaningful.  This has a twofold benefit: he's feeling heard and understood like never before, and therefore will be attracted to you <span class="italic">and</span> you're getting invaluable information about what he's really made of deep down inside.   </p><p class="calibre_5">              When you listen while using the Magic Question, you're employing both your yin and yang energies to create attraction.  Your yang energy activates by your engaging with him with questions, which is a form of leading.  Your yin powers activate when you listen receptively.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Notice that there is nothing passive about what you are doing here.  Taoism has often been accused of passivity, of a go-with-the-flow kind of attitude.  This picture is true but incomplete.  You are <span class="italic">choosing</span> to do all these things deliberately, which is the opposite of passivity.  And if you think the whole idea of taking on yin energy means more passivity – think again.  That listening exercise, when you're supposed to not say anything at all when the other person speaks, may very well be the toughest one in the book.  And if yin energy were about passivity and just sitting there, why would we need exercises to practice them?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Yin and yang energy are two aspects of the same energy, like positive and negative charge, or a mountain and its shadow.  One is not superior to the other, like one side of the coin is not better than the other.  The two energies complement one another to create universal harmony.  Flowing with the right energy at the right time gets you where you want to go.  Chapter 2 of the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span> says:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

devotion does not demand; devotion does not possess.  It is a flood of infinite giving and acceptance.  It is like seed for the bird, the ocean for the fish: abundance, sustenance, the very gift of life. </p><p class="calibre_5">              If you are able to offer all of that and convey it through your face, body and voice, there is no man alive who can resist it.  This is a great power which you possess, and with power comes responsibility.  So you will wield this power only to the right kind of man, the worthy recipient, using your best judgment to find him.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              In the meantime, you do have to <span class="italic">practice</span> conveying devotion so you get better at it.  How else will you be prepared for Mr. Right when he arrives?  Exactly.  Ideally, you'd like to be able to get feedback from a male friend – preferably one who has no romantic interest in you whatsoever, since this is a powerful exercise (a gay friend would be ideal).  Five minutes of honest feedback from a man can forever transform the way you present yourself.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_"><span class="italic">BODY to MIND to HEART</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              This will not come as a surprise to most of you.  The man you will date will first find you physically attractive.  Subsequently, if he finds compatibility on the mental plane as well, he will proceed to like you – a lot.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Sometimes men skip the middle part entirely and go straight to falling in love.  This is more lust and infatuation than something more lasting, and there's nothing wrong with it – it has its time and place.  Fun, perhaps, but solid three-chakra connection, less likely.  Just be clear on what you're seeking.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Let's also discuss what this order is <span class="italic">not</span>.  Mind almost never comes first, so if you're leading with that, don't necessarily expect a guy to fall for you.  Heart also does not come first.  If you're just kind and compassionate to a guy without sparking that physical attraction initially, you're putting the flour in the oven without making the dough first.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If it feels as if I'm mentioning the obvious, it's because I want you to avoid heartbreak and frustration down the line.  If you're super-smart and witty and think, "Well, he should like me for my wit and brilliance – if he's just looking for a pretty face, I don't want him anyway," you're just wishing the world to be different than it is (i.e., creating pain for yourself).  The Good Guy will appreciate your wit and brilliance for sure – <span class="italic">after</span> he has decided that he finds you pretty.  There really is no way around that.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              And you don't <span class="italic">want</span> there to be a way around that.  Yes, there are exceptions, and they are rare, rare.  That's why they're called exceptions.  The solid three-chakra relationship will have as its basis a healthy sexual attraction, and if you don't have that at the outset, you're already starting on shaky ground.  Be patient and wait for the guy who's the right fit instead of trying to shoehorn Mr. Wrong into the spot.  Chances are you've done that at least once before (or know someone who did) and it didn't work, so take advantage of your own wisdom.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The physiology of attraction</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              There is a physiological basis for the different kinds of attraction we just touched upon.  This is because fundamentally, feelings are created by neurotransmitters.  In her book <span class="italic">Why We Love</span>, biological anthropologist Helen Fisher divides love feelings into three categories: lust, romance, and long-term attachment.  Romance can trigger lust; lust can also trigger romance, but to a lesser extent.  Attachment is a byproduct of lust and romance over the long term.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The hormone primarily responsible for lust is testosterone; adrenaline is also involved in mediating lust and short-term attraction.  Romance (a.k.a. being in love) is mediated by dopamine and norepinephrine.  Attachment is mediated by oxytocin in women and vasopressin in men.  </p><p class="calibre_5">The table below summarizes the various hormones and neurotransmitters involved in love feelings and how each one is evoked.  Don’t worry too much about which action evokes which substance; just know that all of the substances in the end increase attraction in some way.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table border="1" valign="top" class="calibre4"><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Substance</span></span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Evoked by…</span></span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="italic"><span class="bold">Extra features</span></span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> dopamine</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> novelty</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> can increase testosterone levels</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> adrenaline</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> danger, excitement</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> thought to mediate love at first sight</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> norepinephrine</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> stimulants, novelty</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2">  </p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> oxytocin (in women)</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> nipple &amp;

better just to know that these are the things that you should be doing, and sprinkle them in liberally till you do them regularly.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">To evoke passionate feelings, gaze directly into his eyes and hold the gaze.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Success and your integrity</span></p><p class="calibre_5">These and other techniques may seem calculated, and to a certain extent they are. And you know what?  There's nothing wrong with that.  Evolution has offloaded a lot of the calculations in the mating game to your unconscious faculties, so calculations are happening all the time anyway.  And all parties involved are doing what they can to improve their chances of success: makeup and clothing to enhance the appearance; fancy restaurants to create the ambience; cool cars to impress; sultry glances to entice.</p><p class="calibre_5">So as much as we may dislike playing games, we have little choice in the matter.  We're all doing it anyway.  That's the Tao of it.  So instead of struggling against the game, why not play to win!  Most people do not play to win.  Rather, they play to remain in their comfort zone while maintaining moral superiority.  Play to win.  As long as you do it with integrity and you’re not intentionally hurting anyone (including yourself) in the process, it’s the right thing to do.</p><p class="calibre_5">To have these techniques work optimally, you have to find your own comfort level with them.  If you know your intentions are good and there is a win for both parties, then by all means forge ahead.  Also, ask yourself this: if being slightly more deliberate and disciplined than usual in dating means that both you and your date get to have a fabulous connection, a great time and a memorable experience, who loses here?  </p><p class="calibre_5">The idea is not to resort exclusively to manipulative tactics to get what you want, but rather to recognize the structure of human interactions and the effective steps required to achieve a certain outcome.  This is merely the opposite of being sloppy and haphazard.  </p><p class="calibre_5">The Tao merely shows you the way the world works, without strict judgment about right or wrong.  However, when you are aligned with your own inner feeling and integrity, you tend to become much more effective, and that is what I recommend.  Enlightened self-interest is the way of the Tao.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
