<p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">The Introduction You Can't Skip</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Monica’s story, or how this book got started</span></p><p class="calibre_5">It was one of those early fall Boston days a few years ago when you thought anything was possible. The sky was unusually clear, the air was crisp, and Newbury Street was humming with life and brimming with attractive people.  I was excited about meeting up with my college classmate Monica, whom I had not seen since we had both graduated from Harvard.</p><p class="calibre_5">You probably know Monica, or someone like her. She is smart, good-looking, funny, in great shape, well-read, stylish, successful – the total package. She had her act together – so much so that guys in college had been almost too intimidated to ask her out. </p><p class="calibre_5">We met at the sidewalk café Sonsie to catch up. And as we discussed work, family, friends, and love life, the question came up: “So – you seeing anyone?”</p><p class="calibre_5">              There was a shifting in the chair, a looking away, and Monica mumbled, "Well, no, not really."  Now, normally that’s not a remarkable fact.  But Monica is kind of a remarkable woman.  Some might even say a serious babe.  If <span class="italic">she</span> was perpetually single, something must have been seriously wrong with the world.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Then I started having conversations like that one with other female friends, and a pattern started to emerge.  Talented, educated, attractive women were having unfulfilling dating lives on an epidemic scale.  They either couldn't find the right guy, were with the wrong guy, had relationships that didn't last, or had given up entirely on the whole dating business. </p><p class="calibre_5">              This came to me as a surprise.  I mean, these were all exceptional women.  There should have been a line of fantastic guys around the block for any one of them.  And yet, they were alone.  And lonely.  Surely something was terribly wrong with the world.  </p><p class="calibre_5">So I had to ask – what's going on here?  That’s when I thought there may be a need for a dating guide specifically geared for smart professional women.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">A guy, writing a dating book for women?</span></p><p class="calibre_5">As it turns out, my guy classmates were having similar issues, so I started out by writing the book for men, which I finished in three intense months of writing and research in 2005.  The book was well-received, and in late 2006, I set out to write the <span class="italic">Tao of Dating</span> for women, thinking that it would take about the same amount of time.  Piece of cake, right?  <span class="italic">Wrong.</span>  Turns out it’s not as easy as I thought to write a dating book for women when you’re not a woman.</p><p class="calibre_5">I was seriously stuck for a long time.  More than once I considered abandoning the project.  I mean, what does a guy know about the inner lives of women anyway?  Surely there were 3.5 billion people out there better-qualified to write this book<a></a><a href="index_split_000.html#filepos171">[1]</a>.</p><p class="calibre_5">In the meantime, because of the success of the men’s book, I was getting daily letters from men about <span class="italic">their</span> dating woes.  And they were having said woes with women, shockingly enough.  Little by little, from these thousands of men, a database started to emerge: what they really liked, what they didn’t like so much, and what absolutely sent them running for the hills.  As their confidante, I also became privy to their innermost thoughts desires, and schemes.  Could <span class="italic">this</span> be of interest to my female readers?  Perhaps.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Holly’s story, or how this book got finished</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Then, something else happened.  Fast-forward to 2008.  The book is still slogging along, and I was visiting Boston, having relocated to Los Angeles in the interim.  I was having dinner with two of my college classmates, Ariela and Holly.  Both are professional women in their thirties, both charming, sweet, fabulous-looking and divorced.  Ariela is single without kids; Holly has a daughter and is seeing someone.  Let’s call him Tim.  Ariela clearly does not approve of Tim, so I decide to get the full story.</p><p class="calibre_5">              “Tell me about this guy,” I ask Holly.  </p><p class="calibre_5">She responds, “Well, he’s really tall and handsome; the sex is great; he’s really sweet most of the time; he’s a bit of the starving-artist type, and he’s not as successful as I am, so I’ve been supporting him for the past couple of years.”  </p><p class="calibre_5">So far, so bad.  I sensed she was holding back, and called her on it.  And – really sweet <span class="italic">most</span> of the time?  What’s up with <span class="italic">that</span>?</p><p class="calibre_5">“Well, when we first met he was just such a sweetheart.  But lately he’s been sniping at me, putting me down for no reason.  And when I spend time with my friends he gets really jealous and makes me feel guilty.”</p><p class="calibre_5">“Tell him what happened when your daughter fell down the stairs,” said Ariela with a fire of barely concealed rage in her eyes.</p><p class="calibre_5">Holly hesitated.  “Well, last month my daughter fell down the stairs at home and cut her head open.  There was blood everywhere, and we rushed her to the hospital.  I was so shaken, and I just needed Tim to be by my side, so I called him up.  He didn’t come.” </p><p class="calibre_5">Didn’t come?  Just like that?  And you’re still dating this deadbeat?</p><p class="calibre_5">“He said he was afraid of blood, and he just couldn’t deal with the situation.”</p><p class="calibre_5">My heart sank.  How was this possible?  Why was this amazing woman wasting another minute of her life on this unworthy man?  What else is happening that she’s not sharing with us?  How many other women like her were stuck in the same place?  </p><p class="calibre_5">At this point, Ariela and I made a very clear case for why Holly needed to break it off with this guy immediately.  Then Ariela looked me in the eye and held my right forearm for emphasis: “Ali, you have a duty to finish this book as quickly as possible.” </p><p class="calibre_5">I realized that if my book could help even one woman like Holly (and Monica) reclaim their power, then I had to complete it and bring it to light.  Two months after that talk, I finished <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span>.  And Holly asked Tim (who turns out was also physically abusing her) to move out and never contact her again, not a minute too soon.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">A dating guide for the modern smart, professional, educated woman</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Although Monica and Holly were just two of the women amongst the dozens I spoke to, their cases were not unique.  Their stories all shared common themes.</p><p class="calibre_5">For most of the women there were external circumstances such as focus on their careers that accounted for part of what was happening.  But I was also hearing excuses from them that didn't make a lot of sense: "There aren't any good men."  "I don't have time to meet people."  "I'm an old-fashioned girl – dating's just not my thing."  Or the worst, from those who were dating the wrong guy: “But he’s nice <span class="italic">sometimes</span>.”  </p><p class="calibre_5">Some of them genuinely didn't know how to date effectively.  And they weren't entirely at fault: the rules of dating are unwritten, and no one had bothered to teach any of us what they might be.  But even more important, I witnessed that they had abdicated their own power as women and people.  While I saw them as tremendously attractive, magnetic individuals that any man would be lucky to associate with, they did not.  As a result, they ended up alone or with the wrong guy.</p><p class="calibre_5">              So this book has two objectives: to help educated, intelligent, discriminating women get back their personal power in the dating arena and beyond; and to give them some solid strategies for realizing a fulfilling dating life.  As a man, I wish to provide a fresh perspective on women's strength and beauty that they may have forgotten themselves and also provide the man's perspective on which dating strategies work best.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Since writing <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating For Men</span> three years ago, I have been privy to hundreds of stories of men's challenges relating to women.  I combined that with my own  experiences to give you a sense of what works best with educated, intelligent, successful men of integrity when it comes to dating.  As a hypnotherapist, seminar leader and personal success consultant, I want to give you tools to re-claim your personal power in all areas of your life.  If you’re reading this book, chances are you are a remarkable woman, and I want to make sure you remember that.  Think of this book as what a big brother with your best interest at heart would tell you if he had a thorough knowledge of the male psyche and had experienced several dates himself.  Seeing you happy makes me happy.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Some time ago, I was introduced to Taoist philosophy and found much wisdom in its lighthearted yet practical way of viewing the world.  As its title suggests, this book draws on Taoist philosophy, which arises from observation of the way the world works.  As such, it is more about the way things are, rather than the way things should be – more descriptive than prescriptive, more empirical than theoretical.  Like Taoism, there is no doctrine, no dogma, and few rules.  In fact, at every point, I encourage you to test the ideas and find out how well they work for you instead of blindly accepting them at face value.  If it works for you, keep it.  If it doesn't, toss it and try something else.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Like the teachings of the Eastern masters and the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span>, the concepts may seem paradoxical at first.  I urge you to find the hidden truth behind the paradox.  You may also find that some of these ideas go directly against your expectations or beliefs.  In those cases, I encourage you to just test them out, without any prejudice as to whether they are right or wrong: just see what happens.  As Albert Einstein said, "If at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."  Ordinary ideas and measures will give you ordinary results at best.  Extraordinary results, on the other hand, require extraordinary measures.  As such, the more an idea challenges your current belief set, the more likely it is to effect breakthrough in your life.</p><p class="calibre_5">              You should think of the ideas in this book as tools for achieving whatever your dating goals may be, from a fling to marriage.  I've based these concepts in ancient wisdom along with proven science to ensure that they are as timeless and universal as possible – as likely to be true a hundred years from now as they are today.  As such, although the book is based on a North American model of dating, most of the principles are applicable regardless of who or where you are.  At the same time, I make some assumptions about you, the reader:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">1) You are interested in long-term fulfillment as opposed to short-term gain.  There are two operating words here: <span class="italic">long-term</span> and <span class="italic">fulfillment</span>.  As with investment and career choices, the tactics for short-term gain in dating tend to be different from the ones for long-term benefit.  Also, it's important to remember that fulfillment is not a person – it is a feeling.  And sometimes the way to have that fulfillment will seem paradoxical (e.g. spending some quality time alone).  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">2) For the purposes of long-term relationships, you are interested first and foremost in a Good Guy.  A Good Guy is a man (as opposed to a boy) who knows what he wants and knows where he's going.  He has a strong internal compass guiding him along his life's purpose, he's completely comfortable in his own skin, and he's a leader.  At the same time that he's a perfect gentleman, always having your well-being in mind, he's perfectly willing to give you some gentle ribbing every once in a while.  He exists in contradistinction to such male archetypes as the Bad Boy, Man-Child and Nice (But Kind of Wimpy) Guy.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">3) You are open both to scientific concepts and spiritual principles and are willing to try on novel ideas that are likely to bring more fun and fulfillment into your life.  If you're more scientifically-oriented, consider this an introduction to spiritual concepts.  If you're more spiritually-oriented, consider this a chance to delve into your scientific side.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              In the end, this book is more about helping you find your own way than about telling you what to do.  Sometimes we can get stuck in a rut, and all it takes is a tiny jolt, a little piece of information, to get us up and running again.  Many people are finding that jolt amongst the precepts of Eastern wisdom, and if you're reading this, it's likely that you are one of them.</p><p class="calibre_5">              <a></a>Some of you will find <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span> highly applicable to where you are and where you want to be, and some perhaps less so.  As for me – I have been through 21 years of formal education, attended countless lectures and gone through thousands of books in my lifetime.  It’s safe to say that I have not used 100% of everything that I have learned.  But I still seek out new sources of information, sit through weekend-long seminars and sift through new books.  Even if I get <span class="italic">one</span> new idea, <span class="italic">one</span> mental shift to see something in a new way, <span class="italic">one</span> re-iteration of a key concept that I had forgotten, or <span class="italic">one</span> new application of a concept, then that exercise has been worthwhile.  I urge you to look at any new learning experience in that way, including this book.  New concepts sometimes take time to digest and results may be subtle at first, so go easy on yourself.</p><p class="calibre_5">              One spark is sometimes all it takes to start a raging fire, and I sincerely hope that you will find many sparks in the time you spend with this book.  I congratulate you on making the decision to bring the Tao into your life today.  Once you allow it, you will find that it will empower you and change your life in ways you had not imagined before. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The five themes of </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">The Tao of Dating</span></span></p><p class="calibre_5">              <a></a>This book is organized around five overarching themes.  We will go over each one in detail in the book, but I want to prime your mind so you pay closer attention each time they appear:  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">• The first is <span class="italic">wealth-consciousness</span>, or the mindset of abundance.  There is enough of everything to go around for everyone.  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">• The second is the <span class="italic">Be-Do-Have mentality</span>, which relates to Napoleon Hill’s famous saying from <span class="italic">Think and Grow Rich</span>: “Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve.”  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">• The third is <span class="italic">enlightened self-interest</span>, which is about acting with your long-term well-being in mind.   </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">• The fourth is<span class="italic"> feminine-masculine (yin-yang) polarity</span>.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">• The fifth is <span class="italic">getting out of your own way</span>.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to use this book</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              <a></a>The purpose of <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span> is not just to give you some tricks and hints for you to scrape by on, but rather to turn you into the most empowered, fulfilled version of you possible.  As such, this book is equally about <span class="italic">transformation</span> and information.  In order to effect that transformation, you have to apply the principles in the book to your life.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So I want you to approach this book less as a novel that you read once and shelve and more like a handbook, travel guide or cookbook.  Mark up the chapters and exercises that you like and come back to them.  I've read the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span> at least 300 times, and I keep on coming back to it, just because something in there always provides me with a new perspective on what's happening.  Think of this book in that vein – a reference you will keep on coming back to.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Now if you’re like most people, you are probably going to start reading the book, get to an exercise, skip it, and go straight to the juicy parts about tips and tricks.  So go ahead and do that – I won't tell anyone.  Skim the book once from beginning to end.  Then go back and <span class="italic">do the exercises</span>.  That is where the transformation occurs (and where some of the tips and tricks are hidden).  </p><p class="calibre_5">              <a></a><span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span> contains a lot of information.  If you attempt to remember and try out every idea at once, it may be overwhelming.  That is why the book is organized in a linear fashion.  Start from the beginning, from the work on values, beliefs, attitudes and what you want.  Then move on to the section on how to find quality men.  Progress stepwise to meeting men, attracting them, and perpetuating your relationships with them.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Think of it as baking bread.  If you’ve never done it before, you start by thinking about a recipe.  You then go through each step of making the bread in order: go to store, buy ingredients, mix them, make dough, bake, eat.  If you try to do everything at once, you’re more likely to end up with a mess in the kitchen than an edible loaf.  But if you proceed sequentially, at every step of the way you just have to remember what the next step is.  As Lao Tzu says, “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.”  Go easy, and good fortune.                </p><p class="calibre_5">I’m very interested in your thoughts about this book, so do me a favor and drop a line sometime.  Just put 'Question', or 'Comment' or 'That was awesome can I buy you a drink'  in the subject line of your email so I know to pay special attention to it.
