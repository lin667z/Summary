<p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Chapter 2. Who You Really Are </span><a></a></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Right now, as you are sitting there, reading this sentence, a number of answers may come to mind to the question, "Who are you really?"  These answers may have to do with various aspects of your supposed identity: your age, for example.  Where you were raised.  Where you went to school.  Your employment.  Your preferences in clothing, food, leisure and travel.  Your endearing quirks.  That cute little dimple you get every time you smile.  Your vivacious spirit.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              These are all aspects of who you are, but they are not <span class="italic">you</span>.  No single characteristic makes up who you are, and most of them are mutable in any case.  Jobs change, habits come and go, temperaments evolve.  So what is that stable, immutable part of you which will always be you, your <span class="italic">self</span>?</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The concept of no-self</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Buddhist philosophy argues that there is no such thing as a fixed self.  Right now, you just took a breath, and trillions of oxygen molecules came from the outside and exchanged with the carbon dioxide in your blood.  Billions of blood cells moved around to nourish your body. You just read that last sentence, which means that millions of your neurons fired to see, process and make sense of these words on a page.  As a result, you are not exactly the same as you were five seconds ago – <span class="italic">you have changed</span>.  Perhaps not in a way obvious to the naked eye, but in a very real sense, you are different than you were a moment ago.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said that you never bathe in the same river twice, because it's never the same river and it's never the same you.  If you were to look at a river, close your eyes, and open them again a few seconds later, every water molecule will have moved, the banks will have rearranged themselves by a little bit, and it will effectively be a brand new river.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              You, too, are like a river.  There is no fixed version of you.  There is no self.  The Buddhists call this concept <span class="italic">anatta</span>, or no-self.  In fact, they say that nothing in the world has a fixed self; everything is in flux.  Including you.</p><p class="calibre_5">              You may find this concept of no-self distressing: "Oh no!  I don't really exist!  What am I to do?"  Or you may find it a purely philosophical, not terribly practical exercise: "Well, clearly I'm here, so there is some kind of self.  What's your point?"  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Let me offer another way to look at no-self: as a concept that can be both useful and liberating.  Since this book is about dating, let's think about it in a dating context.  What would happen if no-self were true?</p><p class="calibre_5">              Well, you wouldn't be afraid of rejection.  And you wouldn't be concerned about what others thought or said of you, since there is no you!  As a result, you would be willing to approach and speak to any man you fancied.  This would vastly increase the range of men you'd be able to date.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Since there's no fixed self to hurt, you'd be less afraid of getting hurt in a relationship and more focused on the enrichment you can derive from the connection.  When you do end up dating a man, you would be less likely to feel insulted or slighted by any of his actions, since you can't take any of it personally.  Your ego would not get in the way of a good connection.  And when the time comes to part, you'd be less likely to feel hurt, rejected or abandoned, since there's no self to be hurt, rejected or abandoned.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Suddenly, this no-self  idea seems really handy.  Is it really true?  Who knows.  Can it enrich your life?  Absolutely.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For better or for worse, the concept of no-self is easy to grasp but challenging to implement.  If we have conditioned ourselves for decades to have an ego and serve it, then we are probably not going to get rid of that tendency overnight.  Buddhist monks spend entire lifetimes meditating in monasteries to get to <span class="italic">anatta</span>.  Since that kind of commitment may exceed your available time and patience, here are some practical ways to bring more <span class="italic">anatta</span> into your life:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">1) Meditation.  </span></span>You don't have to spend years in a monastery to derive benefit from meditation.  As little as three 15-minute sessions a week is enough to start significant impact on your life.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              This reminds me of an old Zen story about a student who comes to his teacher and asks earnestly, "O master, how can I achieve enlightenment?"  The teacher says, "Go in that room and meditate about a cow.  Just think about that cow with unwavering attention."</p><p class="calibre_5">              So the student goes in the room, and meditates.  He doesn't come out all day.  And then the next day.  And the next.  By the third day, the master gets worried, so he asks the student, "Aren't you going to come out?"</p><p class="calibre_5">              And the student replies, "I would, but my horns won't fit through the doorway."</p><p class="calibre_5">              You tend to get more of what you focus on, to the point that you may even <span class="italic">become</span> what you focus on.  So if you concentrate on the idea of no-self diligently, it's bound to take a hold on your consciousness.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's a meditation my students have found useful for getting the idea of no-self anchored in their minds.  An audio recording of this meditation is <span class="bold">included with this book</span>.  You can find it at www.taoofdating.com/goddess.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 3. The Galactic Consciousness Meditation</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Imagine that you have become very, very small.  You are so small that you are the size of a molecule of air.  Now imagine that you are in outer space, with nothing around you but the stars and the galaxies.  You see them all in their vastness, glory and beauty.  Some are so far away that they just look like a ring or disc in the distance.  Some are close, and you can appreciate that there are 100 billion stars in a given galaxy, all of different sizes, luminosities, shapes.  They are all beautiful, all incredibly vast, unimaginably full of light and energy. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              In the corner of one such galaxy, you can discern a tiny blue marble.  You start to move towards it, and for a long, long time, there's hardly anything in your way – the occasional bit of cosmic dust, but otherwise the vacuum of space.  You get closer and start to discern features of the globe – oceans, continents, swirls of cloud.  Eventually, you </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">get close enough to approach the Earth's atmosphere.  You encounter molecules of air –  just a few at a time at first, then more and more of them.  You zip past them, getting closer to the Earth's surface.  Gradually you are engulfed by molecules of air.  You are swimming in them.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              As you approach the Earth's surface, you see a figure who has a striking resemblance to someone you know.  Actually it's you, and you get closer and closer to the surface of your own skin.  And as you pass through your own skin, you become aware that the density of molecules around you goes up.  Remember that you're the size of a single molecule, so as you travel through your own body, you notice its utter vastness – the billions of molecules that make up each cell, the trillions of cells that make up the whole organism.  It's as if the body itself is like a galaxy, these countless elements working together to create a living, magnificent being.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              You spend some time inside your own body, and then exit out of it into the atmosphere again.  And then, you travel past the skin of another person, into another body that's just as vast, just as awe-inspiring as the last one.  You travel to another body, and another, and another, noticing all the ways in which they are similar to one another while maintaining their individuality, just like those galaxies you were looking at from outer space.  And now you're moving faster and faster, journeying through body after body, and you start to see each cell as a star inside that galaxy.  You travel through the bodies of animals, of plants, of every living being, and see them all as they truly are, as expressions of one essence, one truth.  As you do that, you eventually return to your own body, and expand and expand, until you inhabit it fully.  You are now that galaxy, and you now appreciate the vastness of you, and the kinship you have with everything else in the world.  Feel that kinship now, as you bow your head in reverence to your own magnificence, and the magnificence of all of creation.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">              </span>Another simple technique I like is the <span class="italic">hong-sau meditation</span>.  Sit down with your back upright and your hands on your lap, palms upturned.  Now close your eyes and focus on the space between your eyebrows, the 'third-eye center'.  Now with each inhalation, say to yourself the sacred Sanskrit syllable <span class="italic">hong</span>; with each exhalation, silently say <span class="italic">sau</span> (pronounced like 'saw')<a></a><a href="index_split_000.html#filepos171">[3]</a>.  All the while, maintain your concentration on the space between your eyebrows, or third-eye center.  You can make this your daily meditation practice, starting at 15 minutes a day and building from there.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">2) Do yoga.  </span></span>I think of yoga as a moving meditation.  The more vigorous the practice, the better.  Why?  Because you'll be so busy breathing, holding and balancing, you'll have little mental space left for such trivial matters as the ego.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Once again, the key is to have a regular practice.  The more you bathe yourself in this pond, the more of the old notion of self you'll wash away.  Practice at least twice a week if you want to see any appreciable results.  Three or more times a week and you will notice some serious progress.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">3) Use the Reminder Technique.  </span></span>You may have heard of the holy month of Ramadhan in Muslim cultures where everyone fasts for a month.  One of the requirements for your fast to be acceptable is to keep your thoughts and deeds pure in addition to refraining from eating and drinking.  That gnawing hunger you experience in the pit of your belly is a reminder to be a better kind of person all day long.  And the idea is that, after a whole month of that, you stand a real chance of behaving differently the other eleven months of the year, too.</p><p class="calibre_5">              You can do a similar version of that for the idea of no-self.  An elastic wristband, a ring, an ink mark on your right thumb – anything can serve as your reminder to live the concept of no-self during the day.  Use this reminder several weeks in a row, and the idea may just stick.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">4) Experience flow.  </span></span>Psychologist Mihaly Czikszentmihaly (pronounced 'cheeks sent me high') talks about <span class="italic">flow</span> – that optimal state in which the task is matched to the ability.  You're stretching yourself just a little bit, so the task is challenging (as opposed to boring) without being frustrating.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              All of us have experienced flow at some point or another.  For a pianist, it could be the performance of a Brahms prelude.  For a rower, it could be that time when the whole crew works together as a unit and the boat 'swings'.  For a surfer, it could be paddling at just the right speed to catch and surf a perfect wave.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Whatever flow is, you've got to find it for you.  And start doing that thing more and more.  Why?  Because when you're in flow, you <span class="italic">are</span> the action.  Ego dissolves, and there is no more you – there is only do.  So think back to all those times when you were in flow, and seek out those activities again.  You may be surprised to find yourself revisiting something you haven't done in a long time which you still find strangely gratifying.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">5) Travel.  </span></span>Of all of the methods listed above, this may very well be the most potent.  Much of what you consider your fixed identity is anchored into your environment: your dwelling, your workplace, the streets you usually drive, the supermarket you usually shop at, the drink you usually order, the people you usually hang out with, the clothes you usually wear.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Remove all those hooks, and a new version of you (or no-you) has a chance to emerge.  The more removed the locale from your everyday experience, the more likely you are to let go of the fixed notion of self.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So go hang out with some Galapagos turtles, Peruvian shamans, African springboks, and Mongolian herdsmen.  Then write back and tell me how it went.</p><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5">              There's one method that's guaranteed not to give you any results at all, and that's doing what you have been doing all along.  Nothing changes if nothing changes.  This book is about getting results by <span class="italic">taking action</span>.  No action, no results.  You've taken one big step towards getting results by purchasing this book and reading this far.  If you really want to test the idea of no-self and reap its benefits in your life, commit to doing at least two of the above steps now.  You'll be glad you did.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Who you really are</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              We've talked about how you are not some static entity known as the self.  Let's say you agree with that.  So what <span class="italic">are</span> you then?</p><p class="calibre_5">              We've got a lot of options here, so let's try this one on for size: you are a conduit for abundance in the universe.  To say that you are a conduit means that abundance is already present in the universe; you are merely the instrument it passes through.  Since you are the conduit, you do not get to own any of the abundance; you are just the pipeline.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Expanding on that idea, you are also a conduit for right action, or <span class="italic">te</span>.  <span class="italic">Te</span> is the implementation aspect of the Tao.  Taoism is far from being a passive philosophy. It is about taking right action so in consonance with the Tao, so in tune with the natural way of things, that it <span class="italic">seems </span>effortless, the way water flows downstream.  When you become one with the flow of the Tao, your actions take on a lightness, grace and effectiveness that they wouldn't have when they were emanating from the ego.  You abolish struggle.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Another idea to ponder has roots in every ancient spiritual system.  In the Hindu tradition, it is called <span class="italic">advaita</span>, which is Sanskrit for non-duality.  It simply means that there is a ground of being, a basic essence from which all beings in the universe arise.  Plainly stated, it is about how we are all cut from the same fabric.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Rationally, this is easy to grasp: we're all made of the same molecules and atoms that make up the rest of the universe.  The chair you're sitting on, the air you're breathing, the clothes you're wearing are all made of the same molecules of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.  By extension, you can imagine that there is also a spiritual essence that makes up all beings and the whole of the universe.  And you are made of that.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If this seems like an abstract concept to you right now, don't worry.  Monks spend years meditating on this so they can fully grasp their oneness with the universe at a visceral level.  As long as you are interested in grasping this concept and applying it to your life, you will.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Perhaps some day you'll start a regular meditation practice (if you don't already have one) and really feel the meaning of <span class="italic">advaita</span> in your bones.  In the meantime, the passage below from an ancient Hindu text is one of the best I have encountered in explaining how all beings are made of the same essence.  In it, King Aruni is explaining the concept of non-duality to his son Svetaketu, who has just returned from his long studies:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">The bees, my dear son, prepare honey by gathering the nectar of different trees and reducing that nectar to a unity.  So that the nectar from each different tree is not able to differentiate: "I am the nectar of this tree" and "I am the nectar of that tree."  In exactly the same way, my son, when all creatures merge into reality, they are not aware that "We are merging into reality."  No matter what they are in this world – whether they are a tiger, a lion, a wolf, a boar, a worm, a moth, a gnat, or a mosquito – they all merge into that reality.  That finest essence here is the self of the whole world.  That is reality; that is the self.  And thou art that.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">                            – </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Chandogya Upanishad</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">, translated by R. Hume, p. 264</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Embracing The Goddess</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Western society has a pervasive habit of self-diminishment.  As children, we are told that pride is the deadliest of the seven mortal sins.  Hubris brought Achilles down, and if we're not careful, it will surely bring us down, too.  Thus, many of us spend our lives overcompensating for this fear of egotism.  We politely deflect compliments, try our best not to seem too smart, too pretty, too stylish.  We compete in self-deprecation contests to see who can put herself down the most.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Now I'm not quite sure how you benefit from hiding your light under a bushel.  How does playing small and feeling small enrich the world around you?  In fact, diminishing your gifts is a selfish act since you're depriving all those around you of your light.  And as a woman, the world needs your light now more than ever.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There is no more eloquent expression of this idea than in Marianne Williamson's <span class="italic">Return to Love</span>:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Our greatest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our greatest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, fabulous, gorgeous, talented? Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that's within us. It's not just in some of us. It's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we automatically give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fears, our presence automatically liberates others.</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              So I would like to propose an alternative to this regime of self-diminishment: the embracing of the Goddess within.  In many Eastern spiritual traditions, especially the various forms of Tantra, we are all manifestations of divine energy.  Thus, as a woman, you are the incarnation of the divine in female human form.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              At some point before, you may have heard the idea that you contain the Goddess within you.  You may have even found it interesting and appealing if somewhat abstract, not certain how it would apply to your life.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              I'd like to bring to your attention that, far from being an abstraction, the idea of embodying the Goddess is an eminently practical one, with immediate, life-changing consequences.  Because Goddess status is not something that you apply for or wait to receive when you are worthy.  The Goddess is already within you, waiting to emerge.  You just have to let it.  In her excellent book <span class="italic">A Woman's Worth</span> (which I highly recommend if you haven't read it already), Williamson says:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">We think of ourselves as flesh and bone, resumes and relationships, clothes and cosmetics.  The truth of who we are, why we're here and where we're going is far more spectacular than any of these worldly things indicate.  We are God's precious vessels and we are always pregnant with his possibilities.</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              The way to allow the Goddess to emerge is simple: <span class="italic">act as if you already are her</span>.  If the Goddess represents infinite kindness, then you act with infinite kindness.  If the Goddess is grace, then you behave graciously.  If the Goddess is nurturance, then you nurture those around you.  If the Goddess is strength, then you are strong and give strength to those around you.  If the Goddess is radiance, then you shine your light wherever you go.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 4.  Embodying the Goddess</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">What does the word <span class="italic">goddess</span> mean to you?  Take a few minutes to write down what comes to your mind as you complete this sentence: "To be the Goddess is to be the embodiment of ..." Here are some ideas to get you started: wisdom, beauty, grace, joy, sensuality, nurturance, passion, kindness, forgiveness, strength, radiance.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now that you have your list, take a moment to imagine what it would be like if you were to embody those characteristics.  What would you look like?  How would you move differently?  What would it feel like in your body?  Imagine a few situations you were in this week, and notice how you would handle them differently if you were embodying the Goddess.  What would you say?  How would you act?  Imagine some scenarios in the future – at home, at work, or in a social setting.  What do you notice about yourself?  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Finally, imagine yourself interacting with a man you're interested in – perhaps a former or future companion.  What is the quality of the connection?  How does the relationship unfold differently from before? </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              If you are not yet completely comfortable with the idea that you are the Goddess, that's okay.  Do the exercise anyway.  Do it again.  And again.  Eventually, it will feel right.  And sooner than you think, it takes hold in your consciousness.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              This is not about egotism.  It's not about being better than anyone else.  It's simply about exercising the choice to become who you already are.  Once again in <span class="italic">A Woman's Worth</span>, Williamson says: "At every moment, a woman makes a choice: between the state of the queen and the state of the slavegirl."  Embodying your true power as Queen and Goddess is a choice – one you can make right now.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              When you are the queen, the Goddess, then the right kind of men – the Warriors, the Kings – will naturally gravitate towards you.  The slavegirl will also attract men, but she's much more likely to attract the wrong kind.  When you flourish into the most glorious, radiant, version of you, people will take notice – especially the good men.  But that is merely a side benefit.  Much more important is that you will feel alive and empowered, which is its own reward:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">When a woman has owned her passionate nature, allowing love to flood her heart, her thoughts grow wild and fierce and beautiful... When a woman conceives her true self, a miracle occurs and life around her begins again.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> </span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">– Marianne Williamson, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">A Woman's Worth</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Your shortcut to divinity</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              If I were to pick one and only one quality that would bring out your goddess nature and make you irresistible to men, it would have to be <span class="italic">radiance</span>.  It encompasses earthly aspects: radiant health, glowing skin, radiant smile.  It encompasses metaphysical aspects as well: radiating positive energy, shining the light of the divine.</p><p class="calibre_5">              That's nice, you say, but how do you <span class="italic">do</span> that?  Well, if I told you that doing one simple practice would make you irresistibly radiant to almost any man, and remove every woman as competition, would you do it?  Think about that for a second.</p><p class="calibre_5">              What if I told you that this practice would require all of your courage and a complete re-thinking of who you are?  Would you still do it?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The practice is simple, and it encompasses nearly everything we discussed in Exercise 4.  It is called <span class="italic">devotion</span> (which may mean something different than what you think).  If you are able to convey complete and utter devotion to a man, he will feel so energized, so elevated, so manly that he will have absolutely nowhere to go but to you.  You will be irresistible.  We will discuss devotion and how to practice it in an empowering context in Chapter 10 when we talk about attraction.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_10"></div>
