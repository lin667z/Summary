<p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Chapter 6. Beliefs</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">How to keep a healthy mental diet</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              We all know that for optimum health, it's important to eat well and avoid junk food.  It's called junk food for a reason: it tends to be high in fat and sugar and low in the nutrients that your body truly needs to flourish and thrive.  The same principle applies to your mental health.  To maintain a robust mind that continues to serve your growth and development, you must feed it the right kind of food.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Edible food comes through your mouth, and mental food comes through your eyes and ears.  Books, magazines, radio, movies, television, billboards and the like are the substance of this food.  While we have a fair amount of control over what food we ingest, controlling what enters through our eyes and ears tends to be trickier.  "The eye it cannot choose but see,/ We cannot bid the ear be still," as William Wordsworth once said.</p><p class="calibre_5">              We should not underestimate the potency of mental food.  If you are reading this now, this means that you learned the fundamentals of a language – man's most complex invention – simply by catching the syllables wafting in the air from your parents to you.  If you have a skill at work or play a musical instrument, this is because you received the proper mental food at some point in your life.  Your brain then turned this food into learning, which it later used to turn into action.  The mental food you have ingested has largely determined who you are today.</p><p class="calibre_5">              In college and medical school, I was training as a scientist and, as such, tended to dismiss talk about the power of the unconscious mind, subliminal messages and other such pseudoscientific-sounding things.  I had a robust belief in the power of my conscious mind to filter things out and selectively let in only what I <span class="italic">chose</span> to let in.  As such, things like violent movies and pessimistic people were not going to affect me, because I wouldn't let them.  Or so I thought.</p><p class="calibre_5">              As I delved deeper in the scientific literature, I found that the influence of the information we allow casually to enter our psyche is real and substantial.  Many psychological experiments demonstrate this very elegantly.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Psychologist John Bargh did an experiment in which subjects were asked to make sentences out of a list of jumbled words as quickly as possible, ostensibly being tested for speed and accuracy.  In fact, there were two tests: one which contained words such as 'grey', 'bingo', 'wrinkle', 'old', and 'Florida', and another which contained no such words.  What the experimenters were really measuring was not performance on the quiz, but the time it took for the subjects to leave the testing room and to get to the front door of the building after completing the quiz.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              What they found was both startling and enlightening: those who had words in their quizzes connoting old age got to the front door about 30% slower than those who didn't.  This means that for a brief interval following the quiz sprinkled with those words, <span class="italic">they behaved as if they had gotten older</span>.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Eating disorders owe much of their prevalence to mass media, especially television.  Dr Anne Becker, director of the Harvard Eating Disorders Center, studied adolescent women in a remote area of Fiji.  She found that just three years after the introduction of television, 69% of the girls were on a diet or had some kind of eating disorder.  Prior to that, no one even <span class="italic">knew</span> what a diet was.  83% said that television influenced the way they felt about their bodies.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If that result does not surprise you, consider this study conducted by psychologist Ellen Langer of Harvard.  She gathered a group of elderly patients.  She put them in a nursing-home like environment, but with a twist: she gave them clothing to wear from when they were in their twenties.  She also piped in radio programs, played TV shows from that time and left around copies of <span class="italic">Life</span> magazine all from that time and even stocked the refrigerator with long-discontinued foods with labels from that era.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Guess what happened to the patients?  When Dr Langer did physical exams on them after the experiment, they had tighter skin, better eyesight, less joint pain, increased muscle strength and even higher bone density than before compared to the control group.</p><p class="calibre_5">              This is no joke here: things as fundamental as <span class="italic">bone density and eyesight</span> actually improved – just by being in an environment that constantly reminded them to be younger.  So deliberately create the environment for yourself that's conducive to your growth and well-being, and eliminate the mental food that undercuts it.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The good news is that we do exert a fair amount of control over the mental food we allow into our psyche.  You can control whether or not you watch TV, listen to the radio, go to a movie, pick up a book or read a magazine.  Once you choose to expose yourself to these media, you can pick what kind you listen to, read or watch.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Long-term fulfillment and happiness have their roots in a calm mind.  Inner peace is a habit that needs to be cultivated – no one is born with it.  There are enough forces in the world attempting to jostle your mind; they do not need your help in creating further turmoil.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Cultivate a peaceful mindset</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              If you are reading this book now, chances are you have an abiding interest in achieving a lasting, deep inner peace.  If so, you may wish to consider taking a look at your mental diet.  Most media is supported by advertising.  Advertising is designed to make you buy stuff, and it accomplishes this by making you feel inadequate.  The message, implicit or explicit, is that without the object of desire in the advertisement, your life is incomplete: you <span class="italic">need</span> this.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The truth is different: <span class="italic">you have everything that you need</span>.  Everything.  If you're reading this right now, you are probably clothed and well-fed, with a roof over your head, caring family and friends, and enough free time and resources to be reading in the first place.  You also have a working heart, kidneys, intestines, muscles, bone and a magnificent brain – literally trillions of cells working in concert to make every second of your existence possible, even when you are sound asleep.  Sure, you may not have a custom designer wardrobe, a personal cook, or a villa in Tuscany, but those are not things that you <span class="italic">need</span>.  You have everything that you need, and miraculously so.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Going back to the beliefs that we discussed, if the world is truly a reflection of you and your dominant thoughts, then knowing beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have everything that you need puts you in a mindset of self-sufficiency and abundance.  This in turn makes the world respond to you with abundance.  The converse of this would be to approach the world with the attitude "If only I had..." or "I don't have enough of...", which is the sure formula for the world saying right back to you, "You're absolutely right – your life is inadequate," thereby inviting more of that imagined inadequacy into your life.  You get more of what you focus on. </p><p class="calibre_5">              It may be a good idea to excise the following items from your mental diet permanently.  Some of these suggestions may seem a little radical.  However, <span class="italic">extraordinary results require extraordinary measures.</span>  Even a single issue of a magazine can hammer an insidious message into your unconscious mind hundreds of times, making the message virtually irresistible.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Moreover, I <span class="italic">promise</span> you will not miss these items once you get rid of them.  In fact, we hardly ever miss things that aren't there at all – we only miss things that have an intermittent presence in your life.  It's good to think of them as training wheels or crutches – once you can function without them, you're actually far better off without them, since they tend to get in the way.  Here are some crutches you can get rid of:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Magazines, especially women's fashion magazines.</span></span>  Fashion magazines are particularly insidious because under the guise of helping you out, they actually do a lot more damage than good.  There are many reasons for this.</p><p class="calibre_5">              First, the women portrayed in these magazines are usually models, who have a body composition very different from the average woman.  Average height for a female model is 5'8" (172cm), and weight 105-120 lbs (47-54 kg).  If you happen to have that body type, you are lucky enough to live in an era where the fashion for female beauty happens to coincide with your particular form.  Otherwise, less than 5% of women are that tall, and for their height, models are on average 23% underweight.  In fact, the average North American woman is 5'4" tall (163cm) and weighs 140 lbs (63.5kg).  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Although the pictures don't state explicitly that "this is what you're supposed to look like", looking at hundreds of pictures of women with these unusual physiques will leave an unmistakable impression on your mind.  For the sake of experiment, I just went through the fall fashion issue of a prominent women's fashion magazine.  In its 506 pages, I counted 478 pictures of female models.  How would you feel if someone hinted at you 478 times that you don't look good?</p><p class="calibre_5">              Moreover, if you have met a model in person, you may have noticed another curious fact: they look different from their digitally-altered photos.  As such, the ideal perpetuated by these publications is often not only unattainable, but <span class="italic">nonexistent</span>!  Even models themselves don't look like models.  As someone who has lived in Los Angeles for many years and has met many such models in person, I can attest to the truth of that statement.  As Naomi Wolf once stated eloquently, "We as women are <span class="italic">trained</span> to see ourselves as cheap imitations of fashion photographs, rather than seeing fashion photographs as cheap imitations of women."  Time to de-train your brain.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Second, the advertisements in these publications often promote fashion items.  Like the weather, fashion changes by definition, and you are expected to keep up with it by buying the items depicted in the ads.  The implication is that your adequacy depends upon your purchase of these items.  Yet the target moves constantly, the items becoming obsolete soon after you buy them.  In fact, that's how the fashion industry thrives – making perfectly functional stuff obsolete so you have to buy new stuff.  Elegance and style are great ideas; however, they are different from being <span class="italic">fashionable</span>, and you could easily spend all your time and energy chasing down that elusive ideal, which, like the horizon, you will never catch.  To paraphrase Williamson, <span class="italic">you</span> support the fashion industry, but it does not tend to support you back.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Moreover, some items that are fashionable actually make you unattractive to men.  Just remember that when you’re following fashion, you're dressing to impress other women, not men.  Most straight guys are completely oblivious to such trends and the effort is lost upon them.  As long as your outfit emphasizes your best features and makes you look alluring, he's satisfied.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Coco Chanel, the venerable fashion icon once said memorably, "Elegance is not buying a new dress."  In the end, fashion is often about conforming and doing so quickly.  However, you are <span class="italic">not</span> a conformist.  You are an <span class="italic">original</span> – a one-of-a-kind, unprecedented event in the history of the world.  I'm not just saying this to make you feel good – it's an absolute fact.  And a large part of your beauty and attractiveness come from your uniqueness as a woman.  Be the exception, for that is what makes you exceptional.   </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Television shows.</span></span>  TV shows are advertisements for advertisements.  Once again, the advertisements are like a pesky relative: they tell you sweetly but emphatically, over and over, that you are inadequate.  Luckily, you can get rid of the ads much more easily than the relative: simply refuse to watch them.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The average American watches over 4 hours of TV a day.  At 15 minutes of ads per hour and 30 seconds per ad, that's about 120 times a day somebody telling you that you need to buy stuff to be adequate.  Now don't get me wrong – there have been some excellent shows on television from time to time, and plenty of what's on TV is educational.  But there's more 'good' TV programming in a week these days than waking hours in three years of your life.  Even in the best-case scenario, watching a minute of TV is a minute spent watching a facsimile of life versus living it.  This is the difference between reading about weddings and having one for yourself, the difference between a picture of a strawberry and an actual, red, juicy, delicious fruit you can touch, smell and taste – the difference between the map and the territory.</p><p class="calibre_5">              One could argue that the real substance of life is companionship and connection to other people, and a few times a woman I wanted to spend time with refused or postponed my company because of a television show.  Although the behavior is not unusual, passing me over for a TV show is not a good way to make me feel special.  If you make it clear to a man that you prefer a TV show to his company, he's likely to accept that at face value and move on. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">News media.</span></span>  The ancient Romans had a saying: <span class="italic">sub sole nihil novum</span> – nothing new under the sun.  Whatever a newspaper and radio show can report to you – floods, earthquakes, bombs, wars, treaties, marriages, depressions, celebrations – has happened before.  There's nothing <span class="italic">new</span> about news.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              And whose news is it anyway?  The media know that bad news tends to sell better than good news – "If it bleeds, it leads" – due to our evolutionarily-designed tendency to want to know about risk so we can avoid it.  As such, papers and news shows tend to be a concentrated slug of the collected misfortunes of the world.  To maintain a powerfully positive outlook on the world in the face of this hail of negativity is a challenge indeed – akin to staying dry in a rainstorm without an umbrella.  Since you tend to get what you focus on, you may wish to consider letting into your psyche only that which is enlightening and uplifting to your spirit – the kind of information that you would <span class="italic">want</span> to focus on.</p><p class="calibre_5">              This is not a call to provincialism and small-mindedness, and many people need to keep up with the news as part of their work.  In fact, there are publications (I'm fond of <span class="italic">The Economist</span>) that keep you abreast of the planet in a cogent way that is informative without being sensationalistic or containing ads saying you're inadequate.  Awareness is a good thing.  However, recognize that a majority of news media are profit-driven and thus do not have your mental well-being in mind.  As such, they are more likely to add turmoil and anguish to your life rather than equanimity.  Therefore, if it is equanimity you seek, you are better off seeking it elsewhere.  Let the news go – you simply don't need it.</p><p class="calibre_5">              This passage from Williamson's <span class="italic">A Woman's Worth</span> summarizes a lot of the points we just discussed about fashion, pop culture and the media:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">"The monster's third head is the pop culture we collectively spend billions of dollars supporting each year.  It does not support us in return.  Most movies do not love us, most advertising does not love us, most of the fashion industry does not love us... Like many embittered wives, we look endlessly for love in places with no capacity to love us back." </span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Mirrors.</span></span><span class="bold">  </span>Let me tell you a little story.  One of the things I really like about yoga is how it can take you into a deep meditative state through movement.  During class, everything that used to be on your mind is gone, replaced with a focus on the here and now – your breathing, your balance, your full presence.  A good yoga session takes you out of your head into a zone of no-self.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Well, imagine my surprise when I entered a yoga class one day to find it festooned with mirrors.  I had never seen mirrors in a yoga class before, and their presence was positively jarring.  Not only did I often find myself focusing on my own image in the mirror, trying to figure out whether I was doing a pose ‘right’, but I also found myself distracted by the images of other people and comparing myself to them.  This defeated the purpose of the class. </p><p class="calibre_5">              Needless to say, I never went back to that class, but it made me realize the power of mirrors to put you into a state of self-judgment.  When you have a bunch of mirrors around the house, you have no choice but to look at them.  And what do you do when you look at them?  You <span class="italic">evaluate</span> yourself.  How do I look?  How’s my makeup, hair, dress? Is my butt too big? Even if you have only three mirrors in your home and you walk by them ten times a day, that’s <span class="italic">thirty times</span> you’re assessing that butt in a day.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The practice of embodying the goddess is about allowing your inner beauty to shine.  Evaluating your outer appearances hinders that process.  So consciously decide to have few mirrors in your household.  The one in the bathroom plus another full-length one in a discreet location – preferably also in the bathroom – are plenty.                  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Bathroom scales.</span></span>  The surface mind is fascinated by measurement.  It constantly wants to size a thing up, quantify it, put a number on it, as if by doing so it can understand it.  It’s interesting that the Buddhist term for illusion – <span class="italic">maya</span> – comes from the Sanskrit root <span class="italic">matr</span>, meaning measurement, from which we get words like <span class="italic">meter</span> and <span class="italic">measure</span>.</p><p class="calibre_5">In fact, measurement is an act of illusion. Try this: convert your weight to metric if you use pounds (divide by 2.2) or to pounds if you use metric (multiply by 2.2).  So if you’re 60kg, now you’re 132lb, and vice versa.  Notice how you now have no idea whether this is a lot or a little – the number has now become meaningless to you.</p><p class="calibre_5">Allow me to suggest that the number was meaningless all along and that you’re much better off not knowing it at all.  Does it really matter to you how much the gravitational field of Planet Earth pulls on your body?</p><p class="calibre_5">Once again, we have an instrument of judgment.  Unless you’re a wrestler, boxer or rower and need to make weight for competition, the only reason to weigh yourself is to judge yourself.  And stepping on the scale every day is just a crazy-making practice that detracts from your peace, so toss that thing out the window already.  </p><p class="calibre_5">The simple truth is this: when you feel good, you look good.  If you don’t feel good, you won’t look good, regardless of how much you weigh.  A little machine that makes you feel bad is clearly not going to help the situation, so you’re better off not having one in the household and not stepping on one at the gym, even out of curiosity.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_18"><span class="bold">When you feel good, you look good.  </span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Take control of your beliefs</span></p><p class="calibre_5">Beliefs are completely hidden from view but determine your behavior.  Useful, effective beliefs cost the same as bad ones, so why not use the ones that serve you best?  Since no one has access to your beliefs but yourself, feel free to play with them.  Pick outrageous, ostentatious, grandiose ones, even if they initially don't seem to resonate with your personality.  Think of them as a strategy.  If they give you good results, keep them.  If not, try new ones until you get the results you want.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Beliefs determine the range of your existence and the limits of your performance.  Before you can accomplish something, you must believe that it can be done.  Most beliefs that we have regarding our world and our abilities are products of accident or childhood indoctrination by parents or peers.  Some of these beliefs still serve us well.  But, as almost all of them were patterns laid down accidentally (as opposed to deliberately), many do not.                In this chapter, we invite you to take control of your own beliefs and deliberately instill ones that serve you in your goals in the most effective manner possible.  Feel free to expand on the ones presented here, or to come up with brand new ones that suit you even better.  As for the old beliefs – do not give them too much heed any more.  The more energy you focus on the new, more effective, more fun beliefs, the more the brain will automatically allow the tired old beliefs to wither on their own.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              This chapter has two parts to it: <span class="italic">content</span> and <span class="italic">process</span>.  First, we will make suggestions for new beliefs to make you more powerful and effective.  Then we will give you methods for instilling those beliefs so that they become a part of your everyday mental makeup.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 8.

I believe in the abundance of the universe. </span></span><span class="italic">
</span>Look around you.  There is matter, substance, stuff.  It is everywhere.  There is no vacuum, no void, no antimatter, no non-being – only being.  There are over 6.2 billion people on earth, half of whom are of the opposite sex, a good number of whom would make a suitable companion – millions upon millions of possibilities.  Even if you eliminate all of those who are of an unsuitable age, station or language such that only one hundredth of one percent of them remain, there are 30,000 left – more men than you could date in a thousand lifetimes.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So relax.  Expand your mind to wealth-consciousness and the abundance of possibility, and notice how that brings a calmer, more joyous and more powerful demeanor to you.  If you know that the store will always have an unlimited supply of cereal for you, would you ever get anxious about running out?  Become aware of your prior patterns of poverty-consciousness, and deliberately replace them with wealth-consciousness.  Poverty-consciousness leads to a perception of lack of choice, which leads to being desperate or stuck: “I’ll never find another one like him again.”  Consciously choose wealth-consciousness, and know in your heart of hearts that whatever it was, there’s more where that came from.  Do that <span class="italic">especially</span> when all signs seem to point to the contrary.  Abundance is simply the way of the universe.  If this is the only thing you take away from this course, this book will have been a success.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">2. The world is a reflection of me.</span></span><span class="bold">  </span>If you encounter the world with the attitude of ‘Give me’, then the world will respond in kind: ‘Give me.’  If you meet the world with the attitude ‘How can I serve,’ then the world will respond likewise: ‘How can I serve?’  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Through this subtle but powerful mental shift, you have in effect turned the world into your most reliable partner. The Hindus call it <span class="italic">karma</span>: in essence, you get back out of the world what you put into it.  Put in positivity and abundance, and that’s what you get back.  Put in neediness and negativity, and that’s exactly what you get back, too.  A simple way of thinking about this is that you can’t give what you don’t have.  So if you’re giving away friendship, love, and positivity, that means you must have a lot more of it in store.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Since the choice is yours, may I suggest that you believe that the world truly reflects you and bring an attitude of serving and sharing to whatever you do, and watch the miracles that follow.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">3. The world is complete exactly as it is, and I am grateful for it.</span></span><span class="bold">  </span>My definition of pain is ‘wishing the world to be different than it is.’  In metaphysical terms, asking the world to be different (e.g. asking for something in your life) does not serve you because it affirms to the world the lack of that something in your life.  If the world is a reflection of you, then it’s going to come right back to you and say, “You’re absolutely right; that’s lacking from your life.”  So affirming the lack of something has the effect of driving it further away.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              But if we still want such things as companionship, intimacy, and sex, how do we approach them if not with desire?  The solution is to replace desire with <span class="italic">gratitude</span> – and, by extension, hope with <span class="italic">positive expectation</span>.  Hope is needy; positive expectation is affirming.  When you have gratitude for something, you are accepting its presence in your life and affirming it to the world.  In return, the world will do the same and manifest that object in your life.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So you say, “Thank you, world, for bringing so many strong, handsome, intelligent, caring men into my life” – even if you're on the island of the Amazons with no man in sight for hundreds of miles and you haven’t had a date for months.  And the world will say, “Why yes, you’re quite welcome,” and good things will happen.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Personal Beliefs</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">1.

I am complete and beautiful exactly as I am.</span></span>  This belief is corollary to the one mentioned previously about accepting the world (since you are, after all, part of the world).  But it deserves special emphasis, because it would seem that fully accepting yourself is not consistent with reading a self-improvement book.  </p><p class="calibre_5">This is not necessarily the case.  What this belief emphasizes is that, at any point in your life, you are fully accepting of who you are <span class="italic">right at that moment</span>.  It’s not as if right now you’re not okay, and there is some point at which you will be okay.  You are okay at every point in the process, because you are a creature of never-ending growth and improvement.  There is no endpoint, because the only endpoint is now, and there is no time when it is not now.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So be comfortable in your skin <span class="italic">always</span>; it is the most fundamental aspect of attractiveness.  And although you may just be the seedling for a great redwood now, you are still that big tree in essence, at every point along the way.  It’s just that you keep on growing.  And just as the redwood needs water and nutrients to grow, so do you – and you’re doing that right now, feeding yourself with the mental nutrients of this book.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">…The giant tree grew from a tiny sprout.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">The journey of a thousand miles</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Starts from right under your feet.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> </span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">                            – Lao Tzu, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Tao Te Ching,</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> Ch. 64</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              A great part of this belief is accepting what you may perceive as faults.  No one brings home a perfect report card and neither will you.  Human imperfection is not a bug – it’s a feature.  So let go of that false need.  Perfectionism is just another form of self-pity and low esteem.  Throw it aside.  Relax and realize that everyone has experienced loneliness and failure at some point, so it’s normal.  Be comfortable in your own skin.  Which brings us to the next belief:</p><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">3.

I am the more important person in the relationship.</span></span><span class="italic">  </span>Do you remember the safety announcement that we all ignore at the beginning of an airplane flight?  It says that in the case of a drop in cabin pressure, oxygen masks will automatically fall from the ceiling.  And if you’re with a child, put on your <span class="italic">own</span> mask first, <span class="italic">then</span> attend to the child.  The reasoning is that if you do it the other way around, both of you are likely to perish, which makes for an unhappy ending.  This book is about happy endings, so please do yourself a favor and take care of you first.</p><p class="calibre_5">              This particular belief is not about selfishness but rather about practicality.  If there are two people in a relationship, then you have a choice of either making your needs or his more important.  If you choose yourself, then you more or less know what you want, and you can handle that.  On the other hand, if you make your companion the most important person in the relationship, then you have to <span class="italic">figure out</span> what he wants.  You can do this by asking, or by guessing.  If you guess, you’re very likely to get it wrong (trust me on this).  And if you ask, you’re <span class="italic">still</span> likely to get it wrong, since people are notoriously inaccurate in reporting their unconscious needs and desires at a conscious level.  </p><p class="calibre_5">So your best solution is to stick with what you know, i.e. what <span class="italic">you</span> want in the relationship, and take care of that first while remaining your kind and considerate self.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              This belief applies as soon as you have a relationship with someone, and that happens as soon as you start to relate to someone, i.e. at the moment you say ‘Hi.’  Start by knowing your truth.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">6. I am inherently desirable.</span></span><span class="italic">  </span>There are people who don’t like champagne.  Is that the champagne’s fault?  Does it make the champagne bad?  Similarly, you are desirable.  Your company is something that all sensible people should seek out.  There will be some people who don't quite perceive that yet, and that's okay.  That does not change your intrinsic nature which is desirable.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The process of belief</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              The foregoing nine principles were the <span class="italic">content</span> of your beliefs.  Nine is about the right number because the conscious mind can attend to 7 ± 2 items at a time.  For these to affect your life and bring you closer to fulfillment, you must internalize them such that they become a part of your everyday mental makeup.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For that, you need <span class="italic">processes</span> for internalizing and instilling beliefs.  In my experience, one of the most powerful techniques for creating new beliefs and behavior patterns is hypnosis.  As a scientist and skeptic who once sat in on a clinical hypnosis class in medical school to heckle it, I have become more and more convinced of the power of hypnosis to effect lasting change and create new beliefs.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Hypnosis works best when done by an expert who custom designs a session for you.  As this option may be costly or not available to most people, I have created audio files of hypnotic scripts relating to the material in <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating.</span>  </p><p class="calibre_5">The next best thing is self-hypnosis.  A reasonably good primer on this is <span class="italic">Hypnosis for Change</span>.  More advanced techniques can be found in <span class="italic">NLP: The New Technology of Achievement</span>.  In the meantime, the following three techniques are easy to implement and require minimal effort and time commitment.  These are the three that personal development expert Brian Tracy recommends for himself and his students in <span class="italic">Maximum Achievement </span>and the companion audio course, <span class="italic">The Psychology of Achievement.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Affirmations.</span></span>  Tracy speaks of the law of subconscious activity: whatever the conscious mind accepts and believes, the unconscious mind immediately puts into effect.  So for affirmations to be effective, they must speak the language of the unconscious mind.  This means they must have the three P’s: they must be <span class="italic">positive</span>, they must be <span class="italic">personal</span>, and they must be <span class="italic">present-tense</span>.  As it turns out, the unconscious cannot process a negative.  For example, if I told you, “Don’t imagine a pink polka-dotted elephant running down the highway,” what happens?  Did you just visualize the elephant?  Exactly.  So you must tell the unconscious what you <span class="italic">want</span> it to do, not what you don’t.  Tell it, “I am incredibly good with men” as opposed to “I don’t want to screw this up again.”  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The unconscious also tends to be better at accepting statements in the present tense and first-person singular.  Say “I am successful” instead of “You will be successful.”  Writing affirmations every morning in the first minutes after you get up has the magical effect of hard-wiring them into your brain.  Make your list of affirmations (perhaps some derived from the beliefs and attitudes we explore here in <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span>) and commit to writing them down in the morning for 90 days.  Brian Tracy writes down his goals and affirmations <span class="italic">every single morning</span>, and he’s been doing it for decades, and even though he's a guy, his method may very well work for you, too.  It's free to try.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Visualization.</span></span>  See a clear, precise picture of your ideal result.  The mind cannot distinguish between what is real and what is vividly imagined.  Add in all five senses.  Go back to Exercise 4 for an example of this technique.  You can attain the picture of whatever you can hold in your mind on a sustained basis.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Acting the part.</span></span>  Some people call this technique <span class="italic">faking it until you make it</span>.  The fact is that beliefs and behaviors are a two-way street: one can create the other.  Every time you do something you didn’t think you could, your beliefs expand.  As your beliefs expand, so does your envelope of behavior.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Sometimes behaviors can create new global beliefs.  For example, when you jump out of a plane or walk on hot coals and had never imagined that you could, you may come back from that experience with the feeling that a lot of limitation has been removed from your life.  In the case of dating, you may want to act the part that you are incredibly good at meeting and attracting men.  Do it as a joke first, and notice any changes over time. </p><p class="calibre_5">              Remember that if you feel that you’re not good with men now, it’s probably because you pretended that you weren’t good with them long enough to turn that into a belief.  The good news is that you can use the same process to your advantage and replace that useless belief with a more useful one.  You are what you pretend to be, so pretend to be the best you can be.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
