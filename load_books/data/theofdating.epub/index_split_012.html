<p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Chapter 4. What You Really Want </span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5">              What do you want from your dating life?  Most people don’t have a concrete answer to this question.  And the people who <span class="italic">think</span> they know what they want sometimes end up getting it, only to realize it’s not quite what they expected (affective forecasting again). </p><p class="calibre_5">              As we discussed early in the book, what we want from a relationship (and almost everything else in life) are fulfilling feelings.  Once you think of it that way, you realize that you’re not looking for a particular kind of person, of a certain height or hair color or socioeconomic status, but rather the feelings that person evokes in you.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              You also realize that fulfillment is more of an internal phenomenon than an external one, depending on yourself more than anything.  It’s not about what your parents or friends think.  It’s not about how strangers look at the two of you together.  It’s about how your values are fulfilled on the inside.   </p><p class="calibre_5">              At any point in life, what you think you want may vary.  And often what we think we want doesn’t really fulfill us when we get it.  As stated earlier, we’re quite bad at affective forecasting, always overestimating how much things will make us happy (or unhappy) in the long term.  However, your values tend to remain constant.  That’s because values are deep, unconscious motivators that give the general sense of purpose and direction to your life.  Although values are the strongest drivers of our overall behavior, we often don’t know about them until they are violated, much like how we notice the stomach only when we have a stomach ache.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There are two more ways of figuring out what your values are besides having them violated.  One is by noticing events that fulfill them, and the other is through conscious inner exploration.  The next exercise will get you started on that exploration.  For further resources on figuring out your values, I recommend the book <span class="italic">NLP: The New Technology of Achievement</span>, which has a series of drills in the chapter entitled ‘Discovering Your Mission,’ from which the following list of values was adapted.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 5. Empower yourself by figuring out your core values</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">What are your values in life?  From the list below, pick ten values that you feel are most important to you.  If there’s a value that is important to you that you do not see on the list, add it on.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              <span class="calibre_15">Write down your ten values.  Now, if you could have one and only one of these, which one would it be?  Mark it “1.”  Now, from the remaining nine values, if you could have one and just one, which one would it be?  Mark it “2.”  Continue this process until you have your top 5 values</span>.  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><table border="1" valign="top"

question from the beginning of the chapter.  What do you want from your dating life?  The answer is you want from your dating life the same things you want from your life in general.  Values affect all areas of your life, so your overall values for life tend to be the same ones as your values for relationships.  Once you know what your values are, you can decide how you’d like to fulfill them.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              It’s best to fulfill your values in a way that creates the least amount of conflict amongst your top values.  Let’s say one of your values is adventure.  You can experience that in the context of having one adventure with several men, or several adventures with one man.  If another one of your values is variety, then you will probably choose the former option.  If one of your values is stability, then perhaps you will choose the latter option.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              You now have an internal compass for knowing when a given relationship is aligned with your values.  If your values are being matched, the relationship will naturally flourish.  If not, the relationship will falter and you will want to move on.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">What you have to offer</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Would you date yourself?  I'm not asking a frivolous question.  For a moment, take the perspective of a man who is actually interested in you.  Perhaps you have even been on a couple of dates together.  Now, ask yourself these questions: “What draws me to this woman?  Why do I want to see her again?”  Take a look at the inventory of values that you came up with in the previous exercise (and if you didn’t do the exercise, go back and do it – the rest of the book hinges upon that information).  How many of those would you be able to fulfill in a relationship with a man?  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 6. Walking the walk</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Determine how many of the values you came up with in Exercise 5 are ones you can actually provide in a relationship.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              It’s very important to be honest with yourself in this exercise.  No one is looking over your shoulder, and all of this information is for your benefit alone, so it is to your great advantage to provide the most accurate information possible.</p><p class="calibre_5">Now look at that list of values again.  If you feel that you can provide many of those values in a relationship, great.  You need not possess <span class="italic">all</span> of them, since yin-yang dynamics is about complementarity, too.  For example, you can appreciate humor in your man without being a stand-up comic yourself.  But if you’re missing most of the values that you demand in a partner, perhaps you have some work to do in those departments.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, let’s say <span class="italic">spontaneity</span> and <span class="italic">honesty</span> are two values that you cherish in a relationship, yet you tend to shy away from new activities, or be very secretive about your thoughts and feelings.  Since this is clearly not compatible with your stated values of spontaneity and honesty, you must either change your behavior to become consistent with your values, or change your values to become consistent with your behavior.  To demand certain standards from your partners, it’s a good idea to meet them yourself first.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 7. Take stock of your relationship assets</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Write down everything about you that is interesting and attractive.  What reasons would a man have to see you again, or to stay with you in a relationship?</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              This exercise is an assessment of what you offer in a  relationship.  Are you funny?  Exceptionally generous and kind?  A great cook?  Do you provide witty conversation?  Can you stimulate his mind?  His body?  Do you have exceptional sexual expertise?  Do you have an infectious sense of adventure and wonder?  Write down every reason that a man would want to spend time with you, from the most trivial to the most important.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Having done that, let’s take a brutally honest look at this list to find out which of the items would actually <span class="italic">matter</span> to a man.  For example, you may have exceptionally good taste in upholstery, or have shoes to fit any and every occasion.  But will he necessarily care about that?  You want to assess what <span class="italic">he</span> (not your girlfriends) will see as an asset.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              But how do you make this assessment?  What do men really want?  The broad answer to that is that men (and women) seek things that makes them feel good.  Your mastery of the subtleties of women's shoes is probably not one of those things.  Your massage skill, on the other hand, is a much better bet.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Yin, yang and three stages of relationship</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              As we discussed in Chapter 3, the principle of polarity governs attraction in the universe. Positive charge is attracted to negative charge, whereas like charges repel one another.  The north pole of a magnet attracts the south pole.  And so it is with masculine and feminine.  For there to be a spark, a flow of energy between two entities, there needs to be polarity.  This seems to be particularly true in relationships between men and women.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              And so masculine and feminine are two manifestations of the universal life principle.  Everyone possesses elements of both masculine and feminine energy.  Men tend to have more masculine energy, or <span class="italic">yang</span> according to Taoist tradition, and women tend to have more feminine energy, or <span class="italic">yin</span>.  What's important to remember is that for there to be a flow of energy and vitality within a relationship, there needs to be polarity, regardless of which party has more masculine or feminine energy.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Let's examine this in the context of male-female relationships.  I find David Deida’s simple but powerful way of describing relationships through three stages useful as a general framework.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The first stage relationship is between a macho jerk and a dependent, submissive woman.  The man is strong but not terribly considerate and carries a lot of masculine energy.  He has a lot of spine, but no heart.  The woman, on the other hand, will do anything to get even a little bit of love.  She has a lot of feminine energy.  She has a lot of heart, but not much spine.  Sure, there is plenty of polarity in this relationship, but there's much left to be desired. We call this the codependence stage, and room for growth within this kind of relationship is limited at best.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The second stage relationship is between the sensitive man and the independent woman.  This is a man who realizes that women want a guy who listens, who is in touch with his feelings, who has an open heart.  So he has taken it upon himself to bring more feminine yin energy into his life.  The woman in this kind of relationship is strong and independent.  Typically, she has a job with a lot of responsibility.  She can take care of herself financially and doesn't really need a man.  As such, she has brought a fair amount of masculine yang energy on board.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              This is the independence stage.  Although this kind of relationship is a progression from the first, much of the polarity is lost in the feminizing of the man and the masculinizing of the woman.  Such relationships tend to fall flat after a while, and may very well be part of the reason behind the high divorce rates nowadays.  The man in this kind of relationship has a lot more heart than the first-stage fellow; however, in the process, he has lost much of his spine.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The third stage relationship is between the man as a spiritual warrior and the woman as a fully-realized goddess.  Here, the man is able and willing to take the woman deeper into her feminine essence than she could by herself.  And the woman, in turn, is able to guide the man deeper into his life's purpose than he could by himself.  I call this the stage of mutual flourishing.  The man in this kind of relationship has both heart and spine, both compassion and unwavering purpose.  He is the combination of the best elements of the man from the Stage 1 and Stage 2 relationships.  Notice also that in this stage, compared to Stage 1, both the man and the woman are adept at taking on the complementary energy (yin for men, yang for women) while the guy majors in masculine and the girl majors in feminine.    </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold"> </span></p><table border="1" valign="top" class="calibre4"><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2">  </p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Man </span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Woman</span></p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Stage 1: Co-dependent</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> all spine, no heart</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> no spine, all heart</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Stage 2: Independent</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> less spine, more heart</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> more spine, less heart</p></td></tr><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Stage 3: Mutual Flourishing</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> both spine and heart</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> both spine and heart</p></td></tr></table><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The kind of guy you would want</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Now that we've discussed the types of relationships that are possible with a man, it's easier to create a picture of the kind of man who would fit in that picture.  As we said before, you're much more likely to find something if you have a good idea of what you're looking for.  Throughout this book, we're going to talk about a prototype of a man with whom you're most likely to have a fulfilling relationship.  He's the fellow from the Third Stage relationship we described above – the spiritual warrior, the man with both compassion <span class="italic">and</span> purpose, heart <span class="italic">and</span> spine.  For short, henceforth I will call him the <span class="italic">Good Guy</span>, and we shall spend some time describing him in detail during the course of this book – things that will aid you in spotting him and inviting him into your life.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Now as you are sitting somewhere and reading this book, my dear reader, I don't really know you that well.  However, I assume that if you’ve taken it upon yourself to pick up this book, you are interested in a fulfilling relationship.  Fulfillment comes in many shapes and sizes, and the <span class="italic">Tao of Dating</span> is about giving you the tools to find that fulfillment, regardless of your starting point.  Roughly speaking, we'll categorize relationships into three categories by duration – short, medium and long-term – and see how each guy fits in.  Regardless of what constitutes your fulfillment, it helps if you enter into each kind of relationship consciously, knowing roughly what to expect.</p><p class="calibre_5">  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Short-term relationships (also known as 'flings')</span></span><span class="bold">.</span> This is the kind of relationship you enter without expecting it to last long.  It could be anything from an evening's encounter to a one-week vacation romance to a summer-long fling.  The distinction here is your mindset: you are entering this relationship with few expectations as to long-term potential.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For this kind of relationship, any of the three kinds of men will probably do. However, there are ramifications.  The first-stage guy, masculine but not very heart-centered, is the one you're most likely to have fun with while managing a clean break at the end.  We'll call him Biff.  The second-stage guy – the sensitive guy, whom we will dub Lance – is the one most likely to be hurt at the end.  He'll probably try to keep in touch, calling and writing to tell you how much he misses you and how much you mean to him.  This could be sweet but annoying at the same time.  The third-stage guy – both strong and compassionate, whom we will call Victor – can handle whatever happens just fine.  However, <span class="italic">you</span> will be more likely to be hurt at the end, realizing how much he meant to you and wanting more from him than he may be able to offer.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Medium-term relationships (also known as 'serious relationship' or 'boyfriend')</span></span><span class="bold">. </span> There comes a time when you want to be with a man for the long term, but not necessarily forever.  You're ready for a lease, but maybe not a full purchase – a boyfriend, but not a husband.  You're not necessarily entering the relationship thinking, "Well, this is going to last a few months and then I'll be moving along," but in effect that's what it is.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Starting with this kind of relationship, it's best to toss out the Stage 1 guy <span class="italic">completely</span>.  Biff is at best a dessert, enjoyed sparingly; he is <span class="italic">never</span> a main course.  If you substitute dessert for real, nutritious food on a regular basis, you <span class="italic">will</span> be unhappy and unhealthy, which is precisely the effect of having a Biff in your life long-term.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The Stage 2 guy – Lance – is fine for this kind of relationship.  You have (and will have) many joyous, fulfilling relationships with Lance.  Just be aware that the full flourishing of you will probably not occur with a Lance, and so turning him into a marriage prospect, as sensible as it may seem at the moment, is likely to be a formula for long-term disappointment.  And we're all about enlightened self-interest here, which has your <span class="italic">long-term</span> fulfillment in mind.  He just may not be ready for you – ever.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Finally, there's Victor, the Stage 3 guy.  He would be great for this kind of relationship (or any kind, really).  The only issue is that if you're not on the market for marriage, you may not be ready for <span class="italic">him</span>.  Reverse disappointment is still disappointment, and teasing yourself with this amazing guy with whom you can't stay (for whatever reason) is something to consider.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Long-term relationships (also known as 'marriage' or 'life partnership').</span></span>  For this kind of relationship, I can only recommend the Stage 3 man.  You are long done with Biff, you can handle Lance fine but he can't handle you, and now you're ready for the real thing.  Although there are probably more Lances and Biffs than Victors, there are are still plenty of Victors out there, so keep an eye out for them.  The good news is that many Lances have the capacity to turn into Victors, especially when they are in relationship with a fully-realized goddess (that would be you).  If anything has the power to transform, it is love, so take heart.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_13"></div>
