<p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Chapter 8. Find</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_5">Now that we have established the mental framework for fulfillment – the <span class="italic">Be</span> phase – we can get on with the practical aspects of <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span>: the <span class="italic">Do</span> phase.  A logical sequence for that is to find the man you’re interested in, meet him, attract him, and then perpetuate that relationship through time.  This sequence is true of a relationship of any duration, from fling to decades-long marriage.  Each of the five stages involves a particular skill set.  First is the finding.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The good news is that there are over 6.4 billion people on this earth as of the writing of this book, and about half are male.  Eliminating all the men who are too old, too young, taken or not your type and assuming that only one tenth of one percent of all men are single and interesting to you leaves you with your pick from among a mere 3.2 <span class="italic">million</span> men.  That means if you met 100 of them every day for the  rest of your life, there would be over a million left unmet the day you die.  It is estimated that in the U.S. alone, there are 50 million single men.  Think abundance – incredible abundance.  Eligible men are everywhere.</p><p class="calibre_5">The other news is that most women do not meet a new man every day, let alone one hundred of them.  When you meet new men on a regular basis, your chances of finding one you like improve.  An old Persian proverb says <span class="italic">az to harekat, az khoda barekat</span> – “from you, action; from god, blessings.”  So take action.  And the first step of the action is mental preparation.  </p><p class="calibre_5">So take a moment to look around at all the manufactured objects around you – stapler, computer, desk, building, monument. There is nothing in this world that did not start out as an idea in someone’s head before manifesting in the world as a tangible object.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Now, what if that were also true of your ideal companion?  What if by taking a minute of your time to imagine him vividly, you doubled your chances of meeting him?  It sounds a little farfetched, but what do you have to lose?  What if it actually works?  What will you gain if it does?  What will you lose if it doesn't?  </p><p class="calibre_5">If you’re a bit of a skeptic, that’s fine.  I am, too, so I'll understand if you wanted to skip the ‘Ideal Man’ exercise below.  But take a minute and do the exercise preceding it – the famous ‘Quarters’ exercise of Robert Anton Wilson, first published in his fascinating book <span class="italic">Prometheus Rising</span> (which remains to this day the most stimulating book I have ever read).  Done correctly, the quarters exercise will make you look at the world in a very different way.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 11.  The Quarters Exercise.  </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Visualize a quarter vividly – shape, size, shininess, texture – and imagine that you are going to find this quarter on the street, on the sidewalk, etc.  Then look for the quarter every time you go for a walk, continuing to visualize it vividly.  Notice how many quarters you find during the course of the week.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">The first time I heard about this exercise, I laughed.  But I had nothing to lose, and it seemed like a fun exercise, so I thought, what the hell, let's try it.  And then something bizarre happened: quarters started popping up <span class="italic">everywhere</span>.  On the sidewalk.  Next to my car.  Under the desk.  For a week, I almost didn't have to worry about finding quarters for doing the laundry, because <span class="italic">the quarters found me</span>.  When you do this exercise (assuming that you get the same results as I and everyone else I know who’s done it), something very unusual happens: <span class="italic">you, too, start to find a lot more quarters</span>.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Now the question becomes: is it because the quarters were there all along and now you’re paying more attention, or is it because the mind is forging new quarters out of sheer nothing?  And the follow-up question to that is: does it matter as long as you’re finding the quarters you want?  After having done the quarters exercise, you may wish to go back to the Ideal Man exercise if you skipped it, because who knows –  it just might work the same way.  Whether you create him out of sheer nothing or merely start to notice him when you hadn’t before, the result will be the same: his presence where there was absence.</p><p class="calibre_5">You may have already experienced this if you've ever bought a new car.  Recently, I purchased a Toyota Prius.  Now, before my purchase, I had noticed some of them on the road, not thinking much of them.  But now that I was driving one myself, it seemed like the roads were teeming with them.  Every other car now seemed to be a Prius.  Did a slew of people just suddenly decide to buy Priuses at the exact time I did, or did I just start noticing what was already there right under my nose?  </p><p class="calibre_5">Similarly, the man whom you will date or marry is out there already.  He's not going to emerge fully-formed out of the head of some mythological deity, age 30 and gainfully employed – he's been around for a long time.  In fact, you may even know him already. Your task is merely to do a better job of noticing him.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 12.  The Ideal Man.  </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Describe your ideal man in detail.  What is he like? Go into as much detail as possible – the way he looks, sounds, feels, smells etc.  Go into even greater detail – the way he smiles, the books he reads, the way he talks – and make a vivid mental picture of him, with sight, sound, feeling and even smell.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now close your eyes and visualize a picture of you and him together, holding hands and gazing into each others’ eyes, as if you are already lovers.  How do you feel about him?  How does he feel about you?  Summon the picture and the feeling, and express gratitude for his presence in your life.  Keep that picture in your head and fully expect to meet him the next time you go out.  Report back on your findings.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              <a></a>The goal of the preceding two exercises is to effect a mental shift in your mindset towards abundance and wealth-consciousness.  Let me use another example.  Let’s say you go to the supermarket because you need some fruit, and you have money in your pocket.  Which one of the following describes your mindset when you arrive at the fruit section?</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Case A: “Oh, look, here’s the fruit I was looking for.  It’s here for me and I can have as much as I need, and there’s no reason for me to pick anything but the ripest fruit in the best condition.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Case B: “Oh wow, look at all that beautiful fruit!  What an incredible accident!  Will I be able to have any?  Will they be willing to sell me some?  Maybe if I just settle for the unripe or damaged ones they’ll give me a little bit.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Chances are your attitude is closer to Case A than to B.  And yet, in the relationship marketplace, an overwhelming majority of people approach a social setting with attitude B in place, even though they are in an identical position.  Luckily, you can decide to stop this counterproductive thinking <span class="italic">right now</span> and adopt the abundance mentality.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The world is already your supermarket, and every time you go out, there are attractive men <span class="italic">specifically</span> there for you to meet.  It’s almost as if the world has special-ordered them, just for you.  You have inexhaustible money in your pocket in the form of your attractive qualities, and therefore you need not settle for anything but what's best for you.  Notice that this is not about haughtiness or arrogance.  Are you being arrogant when you pick the best fruit and leave the bruised and unripe ones behind, or merely being sensible?  Decide to <span class="italic">make this mental shift now</span>, and notice how dramatically more willing you are to meet men in social situations with this attitude in place.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The three-step process for finding quality men</span><br class="calibre1"/>              Now that you have done the mental preparation, it is time for some real-world technique.  There are three steps to the <span class="italic">find</span> process:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2">1. Figure out what kind of man you’d like to meet.</p><p class="calibre_2">2. Go to where he is likely to be found.</p><p class="calibre_2">3. Have a simple plan for opening and continuing an interaction with him.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Step 1: Figure out what you want.</span></span>  You went into this step a little when you did the Ideal Man exercise.  Figure out what you’re looking for. You’re not likely to find coffee beans in the dairy section of the supermarket, and you usually won’t find 40-year old physicians in the same place that 19-year old college guys hang out.  Knowing what you want makes it easier to spot it when you see it.  Being completely open to meeting any man as long as he’s attractive will paradoxically diminish your results.  You do better when you have specific selection criteria.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Step 2: Go to the source. </span></span><span class="bold">  </span>Now that you’ve figured out the kind of man you’d like to meet, you need to figure out where to find him and to <span class="italic">go to the source</span>.  Again, the more specific you get, the more likely you are to find him.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, let’s say you want to find the kind of man who goes running across the Brooklyn Bridge at 5.30 am.  Now all you have to do is simply show up at the Brooklyn Bridge at 5.30 am for a week, and you’re likely to meet several men who fit that description.  If you want to meet a man who likes classical music, go to a chamber concert.  If you want to find an artist, go to a gallery opening. If you like tall Dutch men, go to Holland.  If you’re interested in someone who cooks, go to a cooking class or fancy supermarkets.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Even though this seems utterly obvious, I belabor this point because so many people neglect it. I often hear women complaining that they’re not meeting the right kind of man, only to find out that most of their opportunities for social interaction come from bars, nightclubs and the workplace.  These are nonspecific, unfiltered venues, and as such there is no compelling reason for the men there to be your type.  Get picky, get specific, and go to the source. </p><p class="calibre_5">Nonspecific venues are, more often than not, a waste of your time when it comes to meeting quality people – and acknowledged as such by members of the opposite sex.  That means that even if you do meet the man of your dreams at a bar, he will likely think of you as “that bar babe,” with all the lovely attending connotations.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Step 3: Be prepared.  </span></span> The most important technique is to <span class="italic">be prepared</span>.  In a world where men are everywhere, you should be prepared to meet them everywhere.  Luck is the intersection of opportunity and preparation – “Fortune favors the well-prepared mind,” as Louis Pasteur famously remarked.  The best way to be prepared is to have a protocol for meeting a man in a given situation, such that you know what to do without hesitation.  I will give you two methods for doing that in Chapter 9, “Meet.”  </p><p class="calibre_5">Below I have compiled a list of 12 different types of men that you may find attractive, and the likely venues for meeting them.  Some of it may seem obvious, and I repeat it because the obvious is what we are most likely to overlook.  As you go through this list, you may see opportunities for improving your own ‘find’ strategy and realize why you haven’t been meeting too many artistically-inclined men at the gym or rock-climbing men at church.  A big part of this strategy involves getting involved and developing your interests.<br class="calibre1"/> </p><table border="1" valign="top" class="calibre4"><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Type of man…</span></p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> <span class="bold">Can be found at…</span></p></td></tr><a></a><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> Artistic</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> art gallery openings, art classes, museum lectures, acting class</p></td></tr><a></a><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> Literate</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> book readings, poetry readings, literature night classes</p></td></tr><a></a><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> Cultured</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> classical concerts, opera, ballet, book readings, gallery openings</p></td></tr><a></a><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> Intellectual</p></td><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> university coffee shops, on-campus lectures, bookstores, book readings, book conventions, scientific or philosophical talks</p></td></tr><a></a><tr valign="top" class="calibre5"><td valign="top" class="calibre6">  <p class="calibre_2"> Adventurous &amp;

border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">Bars, nightclubs and supermarkets don’t do well on the 3 Cs scale (which we're about to discuss), which means that optimally, you should not <span class="italic">plan</span> to spend time there.  However, if you find yourself already in a bar, club or supermarket, by all means use<span class="italic">
</span>the system.  You have nothing to lose, and practice makes perfect.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The three Cs of optimal venues</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              The laws of physics say that the initial conditions of any event chiefly determine the course of that event.  I have found this to be true of dating as well: the conditions in which you initially meet someone have a large bearing upon the subsequent course of that relationship.  As such, it's not only important to choose wisely <span class="italic">whom</span> you meet, but also <span class="italic">where</span> you meet him.<a></a><span class="bold">  </span>As such,  here are three cardinal characteristics that determine whether or not a venue is optimal for meeting men (and by extension, people in general):</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Conversation-friendliness:</span></span> Since men are primarily attracted through the eyes, you have an advantage in a loud venue since they can still see you.  However, to evaluate <span class="italic">him</span>, you want to be able to hear what he has to say, and for the courtship to progress at all, you need to be able to hear one another.  So ask yourself whether a particular venue is suitable for carrying on a conversation.  Quieter places are generally better.  Loud clubs and bars generally are not, but sometimes their quieter patios or balconies can work.  Bookstores and coffee shops are much better.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Community:</span></span> There is pre-existing rapport when some common thread of interest connects a group together.  The more specific the thread and the greater effort people have made to come to the venue, the stronger the rapport, and the easier time you will have making contact.  Talking to people watching a game at a bar is likely to be a fleeting interaction, whereas the people you meet at a conference in Buenos Aires on emperor penguins may become lifelong friends.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Continuity:</span></span>  Stationary people are easier to meet than those in motion.  The longer people tend to stay at a given venue, the easier it is to meet them.  Continuity can also develop over longer periods of time.  There is built-in familiarity with a man you see three times a week at the gym which makes it easier to meet him.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Apply the 3 Cs to the various places you spend time over the course of a week.  Then decide to spend more time at the places that score higher on this scale.  Every minute of your life that you spend doing one thing is to the exclusion of doing something else that could be more rewarding.  Economists call this <span class="italic">opportunity cost</span>.  You want to minimize your opportunity cost by making sure you spend time in places that optimize your meeting potential.  This means fewer bars and nightclubs (low on all three Cs) and more book readings (high on all three), coffee houses, and group events with friends.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              On the balance, you are better served by places that facilitate the connection process, not hinder it.  Using the foregoing standard, you can assess how worthwhile a given venue is and apportion your time accordingly.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Opportunity cost means that every minute you spend doing one thing is to the exclusion of doing something else that could be more rewarding.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The optimal venues for meeting quality men</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One of the most frequent questions I get from women is, "Where are all the good men?"  The answer is that the good men, like the good women, are everywhere.  However, there are good places to meet these men, and there are even better places to meet them.  The best venues are those that score high on the Three Cs scale, because these are the places where you have an opportunity to make an accurate assessment about the men you meet.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Extraordinary results require extraordinary measures.  So if some of these places or events seem unfamiliar or beyond your comfort zone, that is a good sign.  Remember that in life, <span class="italic">everything</span> that you want is outside of your comfort zone.  Because if something is inside your comfort zone, it's either something you already have or something so trivial as to be undesirable: you don't <span class="italic">want</span> something you already have.  So in order to get what you <span class="italic">want </span>but don’t yet have, you have <span class="italic">no choice</span> but to venture outside of your comfort zone. </p><p class="calibre_5">This venturing could be literal, as in going to a new neighborhood or museum, or it could be metaphorical, as in throwing a party at your apartment when you've never done so before.  Either way, I encourage you to enjoy the experience of expanding your comfort zone and recognizing that discomfort is often the surest sign of growth.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Everything you </span><span class="italic"><span class="bold">want</span></span><span class="bold"> is outside of your comfort zone.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              The following are some venues that not only score very well on the Three Cs scale, but also have a highly filtered male clientele.  While some of them have a male-to-female ratio that may seem undesirable at first glance, remember three things.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              First, you would rather be at a place where there are only a few men with lots of potential than in a place where there are many men with little potential (like a sports bar).                Second, with the willingness and ease that you will have in meeting men through the principles of <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span>, you will be far ahead of the women at any venue who are less willing to initiate contact with men.  If there is only one man in the room whom you want to meet, you still have to make the effort to meet him, regardless of whether there are zero women in the room or ninety-nine.  So if you're the only woman who is willing to put in the effort, it's effectively as if you're alone with the man.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Third, think abundance.  There is no competition; there is only opportunity.  And there are millions upon millions of men out there, a good number of whom are worthy of your companionship.  Remember: you are attending these events because they are intrinsically worthwhile.  Going there primarily to meet men is broadcasting to the world that there is something missing from your life.  It's not.  Your life is complete.  At the same time, you are aware of the opportunities for companionship, fun and fulfillment that the world is presenting to you. </p><p class="calibre_5">              One more thing.  Some of the venues and events listed below may strike you as infrequent or one-offs, and they are – like plane rides and weddings.  But, as Nassim Taleb discusses in his book <span class="italic">The Black Swan</span>, improbable events often have a disproportionately large impact.  So be prepared for them. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">That said, let's see where these worthy men can be found:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">1) Dinner parties.</span></span>  This is by far the best place you can meet a man.  Why?  First of all, it scores very highly on the Three Cs.  The venue (usually a private residence) is bound to be conversation-friendly; there is continuity in that all of you are spending several hours together; and there is a high degree of community in that all of you were invited to the party and have at least one friend in common.  Weddings and the like also fall in this category.</p><p class="calibre_5">There are many reasons why dinner parties are quite possibly the best way to meet men.  First off, the sense of community engendered by the fact that you've all been invited by one person (you or the organizer) enables good conversation.  Second, if you are the hostess, it is a fantastic showcase for your talents as an entertainer and cook.  Do not underestimate the power of the hostess. </p><p class="calibre_5">Most importantly, the men at these dinner parties are going to be <span class="italic">networked-in</span>.  This means that they are already embedded within a network of friends and link back to you through that.  The importance of this cannot be overestimated.  A networked-in man is much less likely to behave poorly than a complete outsider, because he's aware that his actions carry consequences.  Moreover, you (or your friend) have hand-picked these men to be present at your party.  Most men would travel any distance for a home-cooked meal.  Add to that the potential of meeting fabulous single women hand-picked by you, and the invitation becomes practically irresistible.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              A dinner party is a deliberate affair requiring planning and effort.  But as with all things, you get out of your dating life what you put into it: results are commensurate with effort.  Although making a dinner party happen will take time and money, so do all those nights out and all those dinner dates for which you spent time and effort getting ready and showing up.  The good news is that a dinner party is bound to give you a much higher return on your investment of time and effort.</p><p class="calibre_5">              A note on weddings: everything that we said about dinner parties is generally true about weddings, too.  Add to that the fact that everyone is bound to look their best, and good feelings are running high in the celebratory atmosphere.  The high alcohol consumption and vacation mentality tends to jump-start things.  Also, beware of the temptation of starting a long-distance relationship with the handsome groomsman.  If you want to have a fun little fling, that's fine.  But know that thinking that you can perpetuate that into a full-fledged long-distance relationship is more often than not a ticket to frustration, which is the opposite of fulfillment.  Just remember that the long-distance caveat applies.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">2) Conventions, seminars and fairs.</span></span>  These events all score very high on the Three Cs, especially on the community aspect.  If you have all traveled and paid to attend an event, chances are you have a tremendous amount in common already.  Because of the intense nature of these events and the fact that you're spending so much time together in a short span, friendship and familiarity can build very quickly, providing a foundation for future interactions.  Additionally, the men are more networked in than the average stranger, since you are all bound to be in the same professional field or community of interest.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">3) Gallery openings.</span></span>  Every week, local publications like the <span class="italic">LA Weekly</span> or <span class="italic">Village Voice</span> (NYC) list several gallery openings ranging from the avant-garde to traditional.  These events rate high on all three Cs, are usually free, and often have free drinks and food.  Young, intelligent, artistically-inclined men frequent these openings, and discussing the art is a natural way to get the interaction started.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">4) Book readings and lectures.</span></span>  Intelligent, educated men go where the books are.  Get there early and sit next to the guy you'd like to meet.  You can also talk to him after the reading, with built-in conversation starters: "What did you think?  What brought you to the reading?  Have you read other works like this?"  Run with it.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">5) Wine tastings.</span></span>  These events do well on the 3 Cs and attract an affluent, cultured clientele.  And if you're into wine yourself, there's no better place to meet a man with similar oenophile tendencies.  The atmosphere is generally festive, and the wine presents plenty of pretext for conversation and jollity.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">6) Yoga and pilates classes.</span></span><span class="italic">
</span> Your intention for coming to class is always to deepen the spirit by exercising the body, so you’re not going to class as a social exercise.  However, as long as you’re already there, it makes sense to make friends with like-minded people who are also there.</p><p class="calibre_5">Although generally more women than men attend these classes, the men who do attend tend to be spiritually-inclined, emotionally aware, gainfully-employed and educated.  Because of the silence and discipline involved in a yoga class, it's not an ideal time to meet people <span class="italic">during</span> class, so show up early and strike up a conversation <span class="italic">before</span> class.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              After class some people tend to be in a rush to get back home and clean up, but it's often a natural segue to go get a casual bite after class at a local eatery.  If he has any sense in him, he would rather eat with you than be alone.  People tend to frequent the same teachers and time slots; do the same, and you can naturally and easily build a network of yoga friends.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              An even better occasion than the yoga class to meet men is the special classes or events held at your local studio.  Almost all yoga studios have classes on special topics which tend to be much more social than regular yoga class. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">7) Community service interest groups.</span></span><span class="italic">
</span> Amnesty International and Sierra Club local chapters are good examples.  Men who willingly join these groups tend to believe in their causes and as a group tend to be more conscious and spiritually-inclined.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">8) Church services.</span></span>  All kinds of people attend church, so it's up to you to select the type of church (or synagogue, or mosque, or non-denominational spiritual gathering space of your choice) that attracts the type of man you're interested in.  The main value of a venue like a church is that it creates community and continuity, allowing you to interact casually with potential dating prospects and thereby get a feel for them.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Two places within the church are particularly suitable for meeting men: the bookstore and church-sponsored activities.  The community service activities are best, since that's where you're most likely to meet the warm-hearted men.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              On the other hand, I would advise you to avoid assiduously any church-related activity with the word 'singles' in it.  From my experience, these events have a slight but distinct odor of desperation to them, and the good men avoid them like the plague while the wrong men show up in droves.  Incidentally, I have found this to be generally true of <span class="italic">any</span> singles-oriented event (see below).  You have been forewarned.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">9) Continuing education.</span></span><span class="italic">
</span> Adult school, church classes – these are all fantastic opportunities.  Go to the classes that interest you, not the ones that you think would maximize your potential for meeting men.  Remember, you are the furthest thing from desperate.  Take the class because it's fun and it'll make you a better person, because what man in his right mind can resist a fun, amazing woman?</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">10) Running and cycling clubs, races.</span></span><span class="italic">
</span> Healthy, fit, affluent men with whom you have at least one activity in common will show up at these events.  However, beware of the man who spends a majority of his time training (e.g. triathletes).  As great as he may be, he probably won't have much time for <span class="italic">you</span>.  Remember that fulfillment is a feeling, not a person, and creating fulfilling feelings for you requires time.  Proceed with extreme caution with any man who doesn't possess enough of this essential commodity.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">11) Long-distance transportation.</span></span>  You're stuck on the plane, bus or train anyway, so you might as well make the most of the situation and meet someone interesting.  Sit next to him at the gate; that way, after you've already struck up a conversation at the airport, it's only natural for you guys to continue once you're on the plane and rearrange seats if necessary.  Phrase your request to sit with him as if he's the one doing <span class="italic">you</span> a favor – he would be saving you from the potentially smelly and boring person that would otherwise be sitting next to you.  Most men will jump at the opportunity to be chivalrous and have good company at the same time.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">12) Retreats.</span></span><span class="italic">
</span> Yoga or any other kind of retreats are amazing places to bond with like-minded individuals.  Friendships are forged here with both men and women that last a lifetime.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">13) Performing arts venues.</span></span>  Cultured, educated, affluent men will be found at the theater, the ballet and the symphony.  If you’re interested in performing arts anyway, go to the event.  Then find out about their pre-event lectures, wine tastings and such, or strike up a conversation during intermission.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Some not-so-great places to meet men</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Although <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span> is mostly about what to <span class="italic">do</span> as opposed to what <span class="italic">not</span> to do, I feel it's necessary to cover why certain venues are particularly unsuitable for meeting quality men.  Although some meaningful, long-lasting relationships may have very well started in the places I'm about to mention, those are the exceptions that prove the rule.  Generally speaking, if you're seeking a fulfilling, long-term relationship, you're better off spending your time at one of the goldmine venues listed above.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Bars and nightclubs.</span></span>  Aside from the fact that they score poorly on the 3 Cs scale, the main thing that will sabotage the potential for meeting a quality man at these venues is that <span class="italic">you</span> will be different.  You will be affected by the loud noise, perceived competition in the form of other women, alcohol, and irritating crowds in a way that makes it more difficult for you to present your best side – or to perceive his.  Moreover, even if you meet Mr. Perfect at such a venue, afterwards you may not be able to take him seriously because of the circumstances under which you two met.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Anything advertised as a singles event</span></span><span class="bold">.</span>  For some reason, these events attract the wrong kind of people on a consistent basis: the desperate, the needy, the clueless, and the just plain bizarre.  If that's your dish, by all means go.  If not, you're often better off staying at home.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Matchmaking services.</span></span>  Some people really like these ‘introduction services’, and they’re generally free (or nearly so) for women to join, and cost a lot of money for men to join.  And that’s the problem: the asymmetric involvement of money taints the whole process.  Add to that the whiff of gold-digging around the whole enterprise, and you have a setup that does not necessarily have your long-term fulfillment in mind.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              On the other hand, if you have friends who know you well and <span class="italic">do</span> have your best interest in mind and simply enjoy connecting interesting people together, by all means be open to their suggestions.  That’s how some of the best introductions happen.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Long-distance relationships: a brief, biased rant</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Let's say you meet a fantastic guy on a vacation trip.  You spend several days together, and generally have a wonderful time.  In fact, you get along so well that you decide to continue seeing each other after the trip.  There's only one issue: he lives in Austin; you live in Los Angeles.  Should you continue seeing him or not?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's my stance on long-distance relationships: more often than not, they are a setup for disappointment and heartbreak.  A long-distance relationship <span class="italic">could</span> work out – 'working out' meaning that it brings both partners tons of fulfillment over the long-term and maybe ends up in something like marriage.  However, it's not <span class="italic">likely</span> that it will work out.  Now my job is to help you find long-term fulfillment – not quick fixes, not the entertainment of your whim, or any kind of longshot that's over 90% likely to bring you more pain than joy.  And the rare long-distance relationship that does work out is the exception that proves the rule.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's why.  Let's go back to the idea of fulfillment-centered dating.  <span class="italic">Fulfillment is a feeling, not a person</span>. And there are many, many persons who could provide that feeling of fulfillment – just as there are several different kinds of food that could fill you without all of them having to be Cherry Garcia ice cream.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Fulfillment is having someone to catch a movie with on a Friday night, someone to dress up with to the opera and snuggle with afterwards, someone to share brunch with on a Sunday morning.  For the most part, someone who lives more than 200 miles away from you cannot provide you with those fulfillment feelings, simply due to geographical constraints.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Before we go any further, let me define what I mean by a long-distance relationship.  You are in a long-distance relationship if the physical distance or scheduling challenges between you and your partner <span class="italic">preclude spontaneity</span> and you can see each other less than once a week.  90 miles of distance between you will do that, as well as exceptionally busy schedules.  In fact, you may already be in a long-distance relationship with someone in your own city and not know it.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Now let's explore what would happen if, say, you started to date seriously (whatever that means to you) a man who lives more than 200 miles away.  First, chances are you would see each other relatively infrequently – two or three times a month.  This means that every time you do see each other, it's just like Christmas!  You are thrilled to see one another, and it's a highlight reel of fun times.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              As great as this sounds, it does not allow for the natural, everyday dynamic between you to develop – the way you would interact if, say, you were married and saw each other on a daily basis.  So even though you're having a lot of fun, you effectively know nothing about one another in a domestic arrangement where you see each other regularly.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Second, no man is an island – they all come with their buddies and cronies, as do you.  To assess accurately whether you and a given man get along, you need to see him in his natural habitat (and vice versa).  In the perpetual first date that is most long-distance relationships, you'll never find out that his friends annoy you to no end and frankly smell funny.  Or that his mother hates you.  These are useful things to know <span class="italic">before</span> getting deeply involved with anyone.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Third, an unconscious undercurrent of resentment will develop regardless of how well you get along because of the sheer effort involved in seeing each other.  Why couldn't he be closer?  If he loves me so much, why can't he just move here?  If <span class="italic">you</span> don't ask that question yourself, your friends will, and they will also resent the fact that he's the cause of your being away for long stretches of time.  Moreover, <span class="italic">he</span> will probably be having similar thoughts.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              That said, there are circumstances under which a long-distance relationship could work out.  In my observation, two criteria need to be fulfilled.  First, there needs to be a definite deadline by which you have both agreed to live in the same town.  Second, you both know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you will be together for the long term when you do make the move.  In other words, you're already engaged or close to it.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If you're in doubt and still wondering what course of action to take, err on the side of caution.  A man who loves you enough <span class="italic">will</span> offer to move to your city.  And if you truly love him, you will ask him to get his own apartment, since that gives the relationship the best chance of success.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Let's examine two case studies, one in which a long-distance relationship worked and another in which it did not.  Perhaps you can spot elements in each story that contributed to the success or demise of the relationship.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic">Case 1: Hillary and Tom.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Hillary and Tom met through Howard, a mutual friend.  Tom was Howard's best friend in college, and Hillary had worked with Howard for several months.  Howard knew both of them well and thought they would make a good match, both being highly educated, intelligent, level-headed individuals on successful career tracks.  Although both Tom and Hillary had many interests and were lots of fun to be around, neither was the partying type.  Both came from stable family backgrounds where the parents were married for over 30 years.  Tom was 27 and Hillary was 25 when they met.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              On their first dates, Tom and Hillary hit it off.  At the time, they both lived in Boston.  After a year of dating, they were engaged to marry.  However, Tom was to leave for the Bay Area in a few months.  They decided to stay together even though Tom was moving to the opposite coast, 2600 miles away.  Hillary knew she would be done with graduate school in a year and a half, at which point she would get a job in the Bay Area.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Tom and Hillary actually got married before Tom's departure.  And I'm thrilled to say that ten years hence, they are still happily married and just had their first child.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic">Case 2: Kristina and Jeff.</span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Kristina was a beautiful 37-year old Hungarian émigré who had lived in Los Angeles for 4 years.  She moved to Los Angeles after her divorce and decided to start over.  Being independent, driven and adventurous, she decided to start her dream business, and after two years of challenges, the business was starting to grow.              </p><p class="calibre_5">              At this time, encouraged by a friend, she decided to attend an expensive 5-day motivational seminar in San Francisco to get her life on track and accelerate her success.  At the seminar, she met Jeff, a dashing, independently wealthy American who lived in San Francisco.  The seminar was emotionally and physically intense, and they spent almost all their time there together.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              After the seminar, they continued seeing each other, sometimes Jeff coming down to LA, other times Kristina flying up to San Francisco.  Every time, Jeff would suggest that Kristina leave LA behind and move to San Francisco to live with him.  Kristina was wary of abandoning her business, but he told her not to worry – he had plenty of money and was happy to provide for both of them until she found her footing.  It seemed like an ideal arrangement.  After a few months, Kristina, with some reservations but feeling adventurous and optimistic, gave in to Jeff's blandishments and moved to San Francisco.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              It took about two weeks of living together to make both Kristina and Jeff realize that this arrangement was not going to work.  They had never lived together in close quarters, and under the pressure of constant daily contact, the magic in their relationship faded.  Towards the end, Kristina felt as if she did not know Jeff very well at all.  Additionally, independent Kristina did not enjoy being unemployed, dependent and effectively at the mercy of someone else financially.  She moved back to Los Angeles,  emotionally exhausted and a little disappointed in herself, but glad that she had extricated herself from a bad situation.  She only wished that she had not gotten in that situation in the first place.</p><p class="calibre_5">              These are two real examples of what can happen in a long-distance relationship, and perhaps two extremes of the spectrum.  All the same, you can recognize the indicators of potential success and failure of a given long-distance relationship from the way the players and stage are set.  Generally speaking, a high-risk scenario is fun in the short term and painful in the long term.  A low-risk scenario may be less fun in the short term but a better setup for long-term fulfillment.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Internet dating: perils and opportunities</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              There are multitudes of books on internet dating on sale today.  This is not one of them.  However, I would be remiss not to give the internet a mention, since it's such a powerful tool for dating. </p><p class="calibre_5">              As a woman, online dating provides you with a lot of opportunities since you will usually be in the position of the chooser.  If men do most of the pursuing in real life, it's even more so online.  Also, many men who are too busy (or shy) to go out will have an online presence, expanding the dating pool for you.  In turn, by having an online presence, you are allowing access to that discriminating man who can appreciate the rare bird that you are.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              On the other hand, when you get a lot of responses online, you also have to sift through a lot of duds – and that's a lot of work.  Moreover, when you meet a man off the internet, it usually means that he's not networked in – he's a total stranger.  This increases the likelihood that one (or both) parties will engage in socially dubious behavior since accountability is low.  If you're venturing into the world of online dating, expect surprises.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The main peril of online dating has to do with its high potential for disappointment, since it upends the natural order of the mating process.  Nature has built in our brains highly accurate, discriminating systems for detecting suitable companions.  Upon meeting a man in person, you are immediately sizing up his height, weight, shoulder-to-waist ratio, complexion, general symmetry, strength, smell, tone of voice, and thousands of other parameters you're not even aware of at the conscious level.  These systems have worked for thousands of years to help you make a good decision regarding his suitability as a mate.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Online, you have access first to a picture and written description, then maybe a disembodied voice over the phone.  And then, if things go well, you may meet in person, at which point you know within the first 10 seconds whether things will move forward from that point on.  Most of the time, things don't go any further – after all that investment of time and effort and building of expectation.  Whereas had you met in person, the first 10 seconds would have been sufficient to make that judgment.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The best way to approach online dating is the way to approach the rest of dating: by taking it lightly.  If you expect results and don’t get them, you can get disappointed.  The more disappointed you get, the more your spirit wears down.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Since I don't ever want your spirit to wear down, I encourage you to avoid activities that involve a high risk of disappointment (e.g. online dating).  However, if you choose to brave the waters of online dating, here are some pointers from a man who knows what he and other men find appealing online:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Represent yourself accurately</span></span><span class="italic">.</span>  Ensure that everything you say about yourself – height, weight, age, occupation, location, etc – is accurate.  A man will only love you for who you are, not who you are not.  Any misrepresentations will come to light upon your first meeting, at which point you'll experience an irrecoverable loss of goodwill, regardless of how much rosy prelude you've been through.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Have as many pictures of you as possible, with clear shots of your face and figure.  Make sure you play to your strengths (as discussed previously).  Get the shots done professionally if at all possible – they will be worth every penny.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There are many men out there who will like you for exactly who you are and the way you look right now.  The better an idea they have of how you look, the more likely they are to interact with you.  It’s obvious when someone's hiding something, and men will run from that. </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Be specific about what you want.</span></span>  The more criteria you have for the kind of guy you want (without being hyper-picky), the more likely you are to find him.  It also cuts down on the amount of sifting you have to do through the responses, since the right men will self-select.  Be especially clear on your deal-breakers such as age, marital status, pets, children, ethnicity, and religious affiliation.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Be relentlessly positive.</span></span>  Mention all the things that you <span class="italic">want</span>, not the things that you do not.  Negativity is as big a turnoff online just as it is in person.  Never air complaints.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Play to your strengths.</span></span>  Online you have the extraordinary opportunity to highlight your advantages – both in appearance and aspects of you that are not noticeable at first glance.  If you feel as if you're disadvantaged in the looks department (which is almost never true as much as you think), this is where you can talk up your other strengths – kindness, humor, cooking expertise, ability to knead him into a pliant pile of putty.  And if you're already getting too much of the wrong attention because of your appearance, you have a chance to emphasize other parts of you.  <span class="italic">How</span> you attract has everything to do with <span class="italic">whom</span> you attract.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Use social networking tools to find common acquaintances.</span></span>  If you find you have common friends according to a social networking site, then he's more networked in and therefore a safer bet than before.  You may even be able to do some due diligence by asking questions from your common acquaintance.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
