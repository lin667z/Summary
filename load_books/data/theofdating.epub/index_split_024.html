Have: Making Relationships Last</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to keep a man worth keeping</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic">              </span>"How do I keep him?" is the second most common question I receive from women readers (after "How do I get him?").  Well, that's a question about maintaining a relationship once it's established, and this book is more about dating.  Still, I'd like to share with you some brief suggestions on making relationships last, and then refer you to the experts in that domain, especially the excellent work of Professor John Gottman.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The good news is that the way of the Tao is the way of effortless flow, the path of least resistance.  So by continuing to do what you've been doing so far, you've gone a long way towards setting up a lasting relationship without further tweaks.  Physics talks about the importance of initial conditions: the way a reaction is set up determines what course it's going to take over time.  If you think of dating as one big reaction, then how you set things up determines how the rest unfolds.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              And you've done a lot so far.  You've instilled the right beliefs in yourself so you're coming from a place of self-sufficiency, abundance and goddess-consciousness.  You've been practicing the right attitudes to give you the best results.  You're clear on what kind of relationship you want.  You've been going to the venues where you can find the right kind of man – the Good Guy with whom you can have a three-chakra connection.  You use your body language strategically to get the interaction started.  On a date, you project attentiveness and devotion and are a master listener.  You make him feel 10 feet tall and inspire him to greatness.  Your teasing skills drive him wild while keeping you empowered.  And, in the end of it all, you're phenomenal in the sack.  Now exactly what kind of fool would want to leave you?</p><p class="calibre_5">              That paragraph above pretty much summarized the entire book, and it represents a fair amount of work.  But once you do it, you're in the <span class="italic">wu-wei</span> zone.  There's no more deliberate doing, struggle or striving involved.  You <span class="italic">are</span> where you want to be.  And where you are is <span class="italic">always</span> a journey – there is no destination in life, ever.  You are constantly moving, unfolding, growing – remember <span class="italic">anatta</span> or no-self. So the way to <span class="italic">keep</span> the guy (the 'destination') is the same as the way to <span class="italic">get</span> the guy (the 'journey'):  Listen.  Pay attention.  Connect on the three chakras.  Make him feel great about himself.  Treat him exceptionally well, while leaving him wanting more (stay tuned for the upcoming <span class="italic">How not to be taken for granted </span>section).  </p><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Connect at three chakras for a lasting relationship</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              I'd like to elaborate a little on this topic that we introduced in Chapter 10.  If you want to have a relationship that brings you lasting fulfillment, find a man with whom you can have that three-chakra connection of mind, heart and body.  A couple that grows together stays together, so you want to be able to grow at all three levels with your man.                To emphasize the importance of having a strong connection at all three levels, let's do a little thought experiment to see what happens when you're with a guy with whom you connect on only two levels:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Head and heart: The conversation's great, you absolutely respect the guy and love him deeply – <span class="italic">like a brother</span>.  Sexual chemistry's weak, and you find yourself perpetually distracted by men out there who fire your loins in a way that Mr. H&amp;H simply can't.  You feel as if you need to be the aggressor to get anything started, getting too much into your masculine.  You are frustrated and unfulfilled.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Head and body: The conversation's great, and you're physically all fired up for each other, so the sex is great, too.  But this is just not the guy who can own your heart, and you crave that deep connection of spirit which you suspect he may never be able to share with you.  Without that, you feel as if you can't fully give of yourself or allow your divine feminine to flourish in receptivity and nurturance.  You are frustrated and unfulfilled.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Heart and body:  You love this guy, and the sex is great.  But he's kind of slow to catch on and can't really hold up his end of the conversation.  He feels intimidated by your intellect and thus never can stimulate you in that department.  Since you're one wicked smart cookie, you are frustrated and unfulfilled.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              I went through that whole academic exercise to drive home a point: <span class="italic">do not settle</span>.  If you're after a long-term relationship, go for the guy with whom you connect on all three levels.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Another very important point: get rid of the notion that you will ever <span class="italic">train</span> a man into the image of what you want him to be.  That goes against the Tao – you're wishing the world to be different than it is and trying to shoehorn it into how it <span class="italic">should</span> be, which is the original formula for pain.  As amazing and wise as you are, and as transformative the power of your love, teaching turtles to fly remains a losing proposition.  Believe me, the guy who's already where you want him to be is out there waiting for someone exactly like you, so do both of you a favor and find <span class="italic">him</span> instead. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Select the man who's already where you want him to be instead of trying to train one who may never get there. </span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Depth in a relationship vs. direction</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One of my teachers said that the feminine principle in a relationship is its depth, and the masculine principle is its direction.  As such, you the woman are in charge of deepening the relationship, while the man determines <span class="italic">where</span> it's going.  This reflects in society at large where men ask the women to marry them, not the other way around.  So pay attention if you find yourself taking over the direction of the relationship, since that's the <span class="italic">masculine</span> function.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Asking for commitment prematurely would be an example of such a thing.  One of my favorite chapters of the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span> is number 36:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">That which must be shrunken</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Must first be allowed to expand.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Whatever is to be weakened</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Must first be strengthened.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">That which is overthrown</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Must first be raised.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">If you want to take something,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">You must allow it to be given.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">This is called subtle understanding.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> </span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">The soft overcomes the hard.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Flexibility overcomes force.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Keep your inner workings to yourself.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Let your results speak for themselves.</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              You can't <span class="italic">take</span> commitment, but you can allow it to be offered.  You do that by being the woman that any man would be silly not to commit to (and if he doesn't – don't you have better things to do with your time than hanging out with silly men?).  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Of course it's less about whether or not the guy is silly than whether or not there's a fit between the two of you.  If you are deepening the bond between you and there is a good fit, the rest should flow without further <span class="italic">doing</span> and effort – remember <span class="italic">wu-wei</span>, not-doing.  And if you're not getting the fulfillment you want out of the relationship, it's probably not a good fit, and you can (and should) move on.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Leave the cage door open</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              The Eastern sages remind us that all things are temporary, and relationships are no exception.  Even the best ones end in death or divorce.  So keep a light grip on things. Think of a relationship as a handful of sand: if you hold it with upturned, relaxed hands, you get to keep it.  If you squeeze the handful, you'll lose it all.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Squeezing the sand is a metaphor for attachment.  The more tightly you try to hold on to something, the more likely you are to lose it.  If there were a concept of sin in Taoist thought, attachment would be the biggie.  So go ahead and love without attempting to possess.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Loving someone means wanting the best for him, and sometimes that means letting him go.  That's why it's important to leave the cage door open, otherwise you'll never know when someone's sticking around under duress or of his own volition.  It doesn't make a lot of sense to insist on keeping someone around who doesn't really want to stay.  So let a man know that he has his freedom.  It's the only way to keep him sticking around. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How not to be taken for granted</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One of the main factors contributing to the demise of long-term relationships is being taken for granted.  All those things that made you wonderful, interesting and special when you two first met are now simply accepted as standard features.  It can even reach a point sometimes where just a small lapse from wonderfulness is held against you.  Unfair, right?</p><p class="calibre_5">              Well, actually, this is completely normal and expected.  There’s nothing sinister about it.  In fact, it’s a demonstration of <span class="italic">habituation</span>, one of the main features of all nervous systems and a cornerstone of adaptability.  As computer scientists would say, it’s not a bug, it’s a feature, and it’s not going away.  So learn how to work with it, not against it.  Be like water, as the Taoists say.  The obstacle's there, so instead of trying to topple it, figure out a way to go around it instead.</p><p class="calibre_5">              To optimize survival, the nervous system has evolved to notice change and filter out the background.  It happens in all of your five senses: eyes notice moving objects and not static ones; you stop noticing the refrigerator’s hum after a few days; you stop smelling something after five minutes.  This is called <span class="italic">habituation</span>, and there are mechanisms operating at the <span class="italic">cellular</span> level to make this work.  In other words, you’re better off understanding it and working <span class="italic">with</span> it rather than struggling against it (the Tao again).  And the proper way to circumvent habituation is to deliberately introduce salient, unpredictable stimulus, better known as <span class="italic">change</span>.  In other words, be a little unpredictable.</p><p class="calibre_5">              There are infinite ways of being unpredictable, but here I want to give you two techniques derived from behavioral psychology and animal training.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The first is deliberate unpredictability, especially when it comes to doing nice things for your partner.  Behavioral psychologists and animal trainers call this implementing an <span class="italic">irregular schedule of reinforcement</span>.  Let’s say you’ve been training a dolphin to jump, and you’ve been rewarding it with a single fish each time.  The fish is the <span class="italic">reinforcer</span> – something that increases the chances of the behavior happening in the future.  Now if you keep up the one fish-one jump regimen, after a while the dolphin will stop jumping as high.  This is not because the dolphin is temperamental or evil – it’s just the way things work neurologically.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The way to make sure that the dolphin’s response doesn’t decay over time is, paradoxically, to withhold the fish for a while.  Give it to the dolphin every third or fifth jump.  If you withdraw it entirely, the reinforced behavior will stop, so keep up the reinforcer; just give it <span class="italic">irregularly</span>.  Now a funny thing happens: the dolphin starts to jump <span class="italic">higher</span> in order to get its reward.  On some level, it has realized that just showing up isn’t enough; it has to work harder.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              If you think you’re a lot smarter than a dolphin, let me ask you this: Has your interest in a man ever increased after he's said he's not interested?  Have you ever started calling a man even more <span class="italic">after</span> he stops returning your calls in a timely fashion?  The fact is, people <span class="italic">are</span> a lot smarter than dolphins, which is why this technique works even <span class="italic">better</span> for them.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              To get you started, think of some behaviors involving reinforcement.  We are unconsciously using reinforcers all the time in our relationships: praise, enthusiasm, food, presents, backrubs, sex.  Anything that makes someone feel good is potentially a positive reinforcer.  Become aware of them.  Now think of all the ways that you use those reinforcers in a <span class="italic">habitual</span> manner, i.e. without thought or variation.  Take kissing, for example.  Do you kiss him every time you leave for work?  Do you kiss him every time you come back?  Do you kiss him in the same way, for the same duration?  If you do, your kiss no longer conveys any information – it has become meaningless.  Stop it already.</p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, make the standard back-from-work kiss the exception rather than the rule.  Then change the way you do it.  Kissing is just one example.  You have probably fallen into habit in the way you go out with him, have sex, buy him presents, or sound happy on the phone.  These are all opportunities for introducing variability.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Maybe the last two paragraphs got you down a little bit.  You’re thinking, “Look, I have a good heart, and I just enjoy doing nice things for my baby."  That’s great!  As long as your enjoyment is the <span class="italic">main reason</span> you’re doing it (vs. force of habit or even worse, trying to please), you will be naturally unpredictable and will never be taken for granted.  This is an extension of the principle of enlightened self-interest.  And as long as you’re not doing the same thing over and over again, that’s a fine policy.  </p><p class="calibre_5">For all the sweet women out there who really, really want to do nice things for their companions, here’s another technique that works.  This is called the <span class="italic">jackpot</span>.  A jackpot is a larger-than-usual reinforcer, usually given for no reason at all.  For the dolphin, it would be a big ol’ mackerel instead of the little minnow it was usually getting.  Human beings call it a <span class="italic">surprise</span>.  For it to work, the jackpot has to be a reinforcer (i.e. pleasant), bigger than average, and unexpected.  A full-body massage or tickets to the game work well; an offer to wax his chest or two tickets to your favorite ballet work less well.  </p><p class="calibre_5">It’s worth repeating that the jackpot works because it’s <span class="italic">unexpected</span>.  Twice a year may be all you need for it to be maximally effective.  Human beings (especially men) catch on very, very quickly, and if you do a jackpot every month, he’ll come to <span class="italic">expect</span> his monthly surprise, in which case it’s no longer a surprise.  So take the middle path and do it without overdoing it.  For an in-depth understanding of behavioral techniques, I recommend Karen Pryor’s <span class="italic">Don’t Shoot the Dog</span>.  It's a fascinating read in its own right and tremendously insightful about human nature.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The four horsemen: recognizing communication problems before they arise</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              John Gottman, Professor of Psychology at Washington University, has been studying married couples for 25 years and has come up with a lot of interesting, highly accurate ways of evaluating the health of a relationship.  In fact, using a 3-minute video of a couple interacting with each other, he predicts the success or failure of a marriage with over 90% accuracy.  Although he studied married couples, his findings are instructive for long-term relationships in general.</p><p class="calibre_5">              What he has found is that there are certain styles of interaction that tend to be harbingers of doom for a relationship.  The worst four amongst these he calls 'the four horsemen', since they tend to be, well, apocalyptic in their destructiveness.  They are <span class="italic">criticism, contempt, defensiveness </span>and<span class="italic"> stonewalling</span>.  If you fall into these communication styles on occasion, that's okay – everybody does to some extent.  The problem arises not when they happen every once in a while, but when they become the principal mode of communication.  Let's discuss each one briefly:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Criticism.</span></span>  A criticism is different from a complaint.  Whereas a complaint addresses a specific incident ("You left the toilet seat up"), a criticism is more of a global comment on someone's character or personality ("You left the toilet seat up again, you inconsiderate lout").  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Contempt</span></span><span class="bold">.</span> This is the worst of the four horsemen because it conveys disgust and the sense that you are better than the other person.  Sarcasm, name-calling, eye-rolling, "yeah whatever" and mockery all fall within this category.  Quite possibly the most potent way to kill a nascent relationship.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Defensiveness</span></span><span class="bold">.</span>  Contrary to intuition, trying to prove yourself right when someone levels a criticism at you does not have the desired effect of making your partner back down. Gottman says this is because "defensiveness is a way to blame your partner," stating in effect that "I'm not the problem – <span class="italic">you</span> are."  </p><p class="calibre_5">Defensiveness is a disease of the ego.  Recall belief #1 about the self from earlier in the book: <span class="italic">Upholding my own importance is a waste of energy</span>.  Much better to adopt the Taoist policy of defenselessness.  As Lao Tzu states in Chapter 20 of the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span>:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Give up overthinking, and end your troubles.</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Is there a difference between yes and no?...</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Must you value what others value,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Avoid what others avoid?  What nonsense!</span></span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">Also, if you've taken <span class="italic">anatta</span> (no-self) to heart and applied Don Miguel Ruiz's Second Agreement – take nothing personally – then this issue dissolves entirely.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Stonewalling</span></span><span class="bold">.</span>  This is tuning out and avoiding confrontation altogether.  Men tend to use this tactic more than women, but it's important that you be aware of it nonetheless.  When you do this, you're devaluing the partner, conveying in essence that "what you are trying to communicate to me no longer matters," which in essence means that <span class="italic">he</span> no longer matters.  Better at the very least to stay engaged and attentive, even if you don't agree with what he's saying.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              So keep your eyes open for unannounced guest appearances of the four horsemen in your relationship, both in yourself and your partner.  And if you see criticism, contempt, defensiveness or stonewalling coming up <span class="italic">early</span> in a relationship, when both people are supposed to be putting their best foot forward, let that be a sign for you to consider reconsidering things.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Some principles for a successful relationship</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Entire books have been written on making relationships work, and amongst those, I can't recommend highly enough Gottman's <span class="italic">The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work</span>.  Everything that he says comes from years of observing real couples and following up with them, so his advice is as good as gold (and the exercises are potentially transformative).  </p><p class="calibre_5">              I'm not going to give a summary of the entire book here, but I do want to highlight some salient points he makes about making relationships stronger.  His pointers aren't just common sense – they're <span class="italic">supercharged</span> common sense, because years of research have proven them to be pivotal.  So instead of glossing over this section thinking, "Well that kind of makes sense, I already knew that," think of ways you can actively implement each tip into your relationship.  This stuff is the opposite of trivial – it's the difference that makes the difference:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Enhance each other's love maps. </span></span> This means to engage yourself deeply with the thoughts, beliefs, preferences and feelings of your partner.  He's really into sports – do you know what his favorite teams are?  Do you know who his best friends are?  That he likes his vinaigrette on the side?  What his favorite Mexican dish is?  What his basic religious beliefs are?  What his deepest passions are?  The better you know and openly care about these things, the better your relationship will be.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Nurture your fondness and admiration.</span></span>  Every couple starts out with plenty of reasons to like one another.  Keep them alive!  It becomes the basis for a fundamentally positive view of your partner, which is a useful buffer against future challenges (which will always come).  Now I know this sounds totally obvious, but I wouldn't be emphasizing this if I didn't see couples who routinely take each other for granted and allow their relationship to deteriorate.  Think of nurturing the fondness and admiration as a potent antidote to the four horsemen mentioned above and the regular workout needed to keep your relationship in shape.  Regular compliments, showing interest, propping him up, talking him up to others – all of these little things go a long way.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Know the difference between your solvable and unsolvable problems.</span></span>  If you're a churchgoer and he's an atheist, that's not likely to change – it's an unsolvable problem.  Learn to engage in dialogue about it without hurting each other, since the issue ain't going away anytime soon.  On the other hand, if you like theater and he prefers baseball, that's a solvable problem.  You can alternate which one you watch, go separately with friends, or do something else that you both enjoy.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">              </span>If you're going to bring up some disgruntlement, it's essential to avoid <span class="italic">harsh startup</span> – i.e. beginning with an accusatory, blaming tone that devalues your partner.  It just starts things on exactly the wrong foot, sending it downhill fast.  I really like Gottman's guidelines to ensure your startup is soft: </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Complain but don't blame.</p><p class="calibre_5">• Make statements that start with "I" instead of "You". </p><p class="calibre_5">• Describe what's happening without judgment.</p><p class="calibre_5">• Don't bottle things up. </p><p class="calibre_5">• Be clear, polite and appreciative.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">              </span>This section may have been brief, but please do not let its brevity belie the importance of the information contained.  It takes only six numbers to win millions in a lottery, so the <span class="italic">quality</span> of information is often more important than its quantity.  What I just gave you was decades of wisdom from someone who's studied thousands of couples, all condensed into a few short paragraphs.  Weigh, value and use it accordingly.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Take your own counsel, again</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              In the end, there are as many ways of keeping a relationship going as there are relationships.  What’s important is to be aware of <span class="italic">why</span> you wish to keep a relationship going.  It is one thing to keep it going because it’s a source of growth and fulfillment for both of you; another to keep it going just for the sake of keeping it going.  If something adds to your growth and freedom, you should keep it in your life; if not, let it go.  It's a good rule to apply to relationships, and pretty much everything else.</p><p class="calibre_5"></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
