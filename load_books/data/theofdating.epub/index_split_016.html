<p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Chapter 7. Attitudes</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The six rules of attitude</span></p><p class="calibre_5">Attitudes are the next phase in our movement from the more hidden aspects of personal power to the more manifest.  Attitudes are somewhat more overt than beliefs, but still mostly hidden from view.  </p><p class="calibre_5">There are two powerful ways of expressing attitudes.  The first is to articulate them as <span class="italic">rules</span>.  Keeping the rules in mind creates the right behaviors which lead to the right results.  The other is to think of them as behavioral modes, or <span class="italic">roles</span> to play.  The role has the attitude built in.  By naturally falling into that role, you have no choice but to manifest the behaviors that go along with it.  Here are the rules:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">1. I will not give excess importance to what anyone else thinks or says.  </span></span>This rule is about having an internal frame of reference.  Many women try to behave in a way to conform to what a man (or peer) may think.  “Will he like this dress?  Does he think I look good?”  This is a waste of time and a squandering of your personal power.  You have no idea what he is thinking, and even if you did, it’s a poor guide for your behavior. Much better to know what <span class="italic">you</span> want, and have him wonder what you think of <span class="italic">him</span> (which most men are doing anyway).  Always assume the position of the buyer.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">              </span></span>One of the <span class="italic">Four Agreements</span> from Toltec spiritual teacher Don Miguel Ruiz's book of the same name is to take nothing personally.  It's one of the best pieces of advice I've ever received, and a great way to articulate this rule. </p><p class="calibre_5">              Words can also be deceptive, so be careful about how much importance you place on them.  How many times have you heard ‘Yeah, sure’ when it meant ‘No’, and how many times have you heard ‘I don’t think so’ only to find out later that it meant ‘Well I wasn't sure then but may I have some more now’?  This happens over and over again, so it’s important to have a more reliable signal than speech.  Which brings us to the next rule.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">2. I will cue my behavior to what he does, not what he says.</span></span>  Everybody, male or female, needs companionship and likes to have fun, but men and women have been trained to be coy.  So we use words as instruments of obfuscation instead of clarification.  So in a social interaction, watch him like a hawk.  Not only is it flattering to pay him attention, but the information you glean will be invaluable.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So watch for mismatches in his speech and behavior.  Is he saying he’s not really interested in a relationship while hovering around you the whole time?  Does he send you a seemingly bland email the day right after meeting you?  Does he say he'd really like to go out with you but in a flat, unenthusiastic monotone?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Pay attention here to the <span class="italic">meta-communication</span>, not to the content of the communication.  For example, if a man calls you five times to tell you he's not interested, then he's <span class="italic">communicating</span> lack of interest.  However, his action – calling you five times – is the <span class="italic">meta-communication</span>, which says unmistakably that he <span class="italic">is</span> interested.  Conversely, if he calls you once every two months to tell you he misses you terribly (and he lives ten blocks away), then he's really saying he's not that interested.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Also, nonverbal behavior is much harder to fake than verbal pronouncement, so treat the information you get from nonverbal behavior as gold.  Is his body turned towards you?  Is he leaning towards you or away from you in the conversation?  Is he paying attention to you or are his eyes darting around?  We’ll go into more detail about nonverbal communication in a later section.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">3. I will positively reinforce the behaviors that I like in others and neglect the behaviors that I don’t like</span></span>.  In behavioral psychology, a reinforcer is something that increases the likelihood of a behavior happening in the future (see <span class="italic">Don’t Shoot the Dog</span> by Karen Pryor).  Animal trainers use food rewards to train dolphins, dogs, primates, etc.  Luckily, people are much smarter than animals, so you don’t need to carry a cod or banana to parties to implement this rule.  For people,<span class="italic"> praise</span> and <span class="italic">attention</span> work just as well.  Conveniently, they can also be used immediately after or during the desirable behavior, which is the way a positive reinforcer is most effective.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, if he gets you a drink or holds your seat for you, look directly into his eyes and enthusiastically say, “Thank you SO much, that was so sweet of you.”  For behaviors that you’d like to see less of, withdraw your attention: look to the side, look bored, or turn your body away from him.  This is the opposite of getting angry: anger is an unmistakable sign of <span class="italic">attention</span> and therefore another positive reinforcer.  The law of extinction says that a behavior that is not positively reinforced will decay and disappear over time, so just coolly ignore what you <span class="italic">don’t</span> like while making a big fuss about the things he does that you <span class="italic">do</span> like.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">4. I’m not attached to any particular result, so I will  flirt with him because it's fun.  </span></span>If you were to remember just one rule when you’re going out into social situations, it should be this one.  It embodies two key principles: the mindset that you are the prize, and an attitude of detachment.  Being desireless and detached from results embodies the essence of Taoist thinking and is the key to effective action.  We will go into more detail on tantalizing and flirting in later chapters.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">5. I am the only person allowed to assess my success or failure.</span></span><span class="bold">  </span>For better or for worse, rejection hurts, and this pain seems to have been embedded deep into the tribal mind of <span class="italic">Homo sapiens</span>.  Fear of rejection gets in the way of many a woman’s romantic success, so we should do something to handle it more effectively.  But how do you know when you have been rejected?  Where is that rule written?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Well, it’s not written anywhere, and even now, if I were to ask you to state explicitly what constitutes rejection, you wouldn’t know.  Are you rejected if he doesn’t return your phone call?  If he doesn’t show up for a date?  What if he really liked you and was too shy to call back?  What if he would have been really terrible for you and did you a huge favor by staying out of your life?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              What I suggest here is that you craft your personal rule for rejection, and do it in a way such that it’s effectively impossible to be rejected.  My personal rule for rejection is: “I know I have been rejected when someone proves unequivocally that I have behaved in a malicious way.”  And since I generally don’t behave maliciously, it’s rare for me to ever feel rejected.  We will go through this exercise in detail in Chapter 9.</p><p class="calibre_5">              On a more metaphysical note, if you have a habit of self-deprecation, stop it.  Now.  There are enough forces in the world trying to bring you down, and they don’t need your help.  Be your own best advocate.  Build yourself up instead of bringing yourself down; err on the side of pride if you must. Which brings us to the next rule.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">6. I will always leave him wanting more.</span></span>  Let’s say you were at a theater watching a movie preview, and the preview had all the highlights of the movie.  It told you what happens in the beginning, in the middle, and how the movie ends.  How compelled would you be to see that movie now?  Probably not very.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Similarly, in your interactions with men, you don’t want to give away the store.  You want to give a preview, a taste of who you are, with the implication that there’s a lot more left.  Don’t tell them too much about your job, your background, or where you’re from.  Think appetizers, not full courses.  The rule applies to physical interactions as well as information.  For example, if you can give excellent hand massages, just do part of one hand, then stop, and move on to something else.  If you’re kissing him, be the first to stop.  We'll cover this topic more extensively in Chapter 11.</p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Your attitude towards your body</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">              </span>Do you like your body?  Do you <span class="italic">love</span> your body?  We're all built a certain way, and there's not a whole lot we can do about that.  Sure, you can put on makeup, or maybe exercise a little more, but the basics are here to stay.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              As I've said before, pain is wishing the world to be different than it is.  Your body is part of the world, so you can either fight a futile fight against the way it is, or accept and appreciate it.  Here are two suggestions for doing that.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Inhabit your body</span></span>.  At first glance, that may seem like a strange thing to say – how can you <span class="italic">not</span> inhabit your body?  And yet, too many people go about their days filtering out the body, oblivious to its signals, its needs, treating it like some kind of car made of flesh and bone – wash it now, fuel it then, repair it sometime.  No!  Your body is not the <span class="italic">vehicle</span> for you – it <span class="italic">is</span> you.  When you speak of the hair, the butt, the belly, the thighs in the same way you say <span class="italic">the coffee table</span> and <span class="italic">the car</span>, you objectify your body and distance yourself from it.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              When you fully inhabit your body, you start to appreciate it.  When you appreciate it, you start to love it.  And the more you love your body, the more you love <span class="italic">you</span>, the more attractive you become.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Emphasize your strengths.</span></span>  No one woman has a monopoly on beauty, and even the prettiest women in the world perceive themselves as having so-called flaws.  Everyone has strengths and weaknesses when it comes to appearance.  So play to your strengths.  Do you have big, beautiful eyes that everyone compliments?  Emphasize them.  Great hourglass figure?  Wear a dress that flatters it.  Nice legs?  Wear an outfit that presents them well.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Note that men will appreciate you for what you have to offer, not what you don't.  So highlight your strengths in the appearance department, don't worry about the rest, and you'll draw plenty of appreciative men to you.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 10.  Accepting and appreciating your body</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Find a quiet place where you can concentrate for the next few minutes without any interruptions.  Now I invite you to relax... and imagine the time when you were a single cell... just one little tiny cell.  This cell divided into two, then four, then eight, then sixteen, then 32.  And it kept on dividing, until there were thousands of cells... millions... then billions... then trillions.  These cells ordered themselves into muscles to move you, bone to support you, digestive tract to feed you, blood to carry oxygen and nutrients everywhere, kidneys to clean your blood, brain cells to run the whole show.  And these trillions of cells all worked together in perfect unison, for years and years, all without any interference from your conscious mind.  It's really mind-boggling and a complete miracle that we exist at all.  So take a moment now to marvel at this magnificent machine that is you, and give it some deep gratitude.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Every day your body keeps you healthy and alive by fending off billions of infectious agents, by extracting nutrients from the food you eat, by filtering your blood of waste products.  So just do a quick scan of your body from toe to head, and as your attention passes over each body part, thank it for all that it has done for you and is doing for you now.  Accept your body for the miracle that it is, and appreciate it for the gift that you are.  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Love your body now</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              The following is one of the best pieces I have read on relating to one's body in a healthy way.  My good friend Christine Mason McCaull wrote it.  She is a truly remarkable woman: entrepreneur, CEO, yoga teacher, artist, environmentalist, writer, wife, and mother of four amazing children. Many of my female friends have found this piece useful, and it's so eloquent and empowering that I really can't improve upon it.  She's been kind enough to allow me to include it in <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span>, so I hope you find it useful:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Wherever you are, love your body as it is right now.</span></span> I mean now, not when it achieves some desired future state or as it was at a reminisced point of peak fitness. I mean now, not when it is ailment-free. It’s a magnificent machine, and does wonders for you everyday. Maybe it only gets your spirit from the bed to the bathroom, or maybe it allows you to have babies, or peel a banana or walk to the store or dance Swan Lake or hold a handstand. Whether it is fat or tall or small or imbalanced or polished or bearded or wispy or unpredictable – just love it for what it does for you. Appreciate all the elements and miracles that allow you to live – strong legs, ample hips, the crook of the elbow. The fullness of the heart-beating, veins-throbbing, stomach-growling you!              </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Decommoditize yourself.</span></span> Your body may be valued in the abstract by the culture at large for its sexuality, its reproductive and productive capacity, its creative capacity – or any number of other things. Don’t allow yourself to be commoditized! There is no cookie-cutter beauty, sexuality, age, or attractiveness.  These are cultural constructs, and there is no need to accept these constructs or support their ongoing existence. If you were born in a different place and time, the rules would have been different. They are not real! </p><p class="calibre_5">              Plus, realize that a lot of people make money by trying to convince you that you should be different.  They take your resources and power by trying to trick you into thinking you will have more resources and power or love by investing in a stereotype of beauty. Imagine what would happen if the scores of hours and all the emotional and intellectual energy that went into counting calories or self-berating actually went into living! Take a cue from artist Stefan Sagmeister, who says: “Trying to look good limits my life.”  Derive your value from being most fully alive, from the times when you are intimate, compassionate, caring, creative, engaged – not from the outward projection.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Decommoditize others.</span></span> Stop praising other people for the values of the commodity-body culture, and start calling out those qualities that make them most themselves, approachable, reachable, human!  Begin to notice and compliment people when they embody values that are more to the point: for their humor, intelligence, flair, originality, intensity, focus. Tell them “I love it when you smile – you light up the room!” Even better, take the time to pause and look into people’s eyes and lift the veil that separates you. Check your own judgment at the door and try to see the person behind the body.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Get real</span></span>. Look around you at <span class="italic">real</span> people and <span class="italic">real</span> bodies of all ages. How does skin age? Joints age? What’s genetic? What’s diet and habit? What is the range of appearance? How many people do you see that look like the magazines? This is the range and magnificence of humanity and there is no shame in it. Those who would judge have not yet seen this truth. In this context you are but one in 6 billion – and probably not that different from most.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Want to get really real?  Go somewhere and be naked, in a non-sexual way. There are hundreds of places where hippies, free spirits, and those that want to be free go and take their clothes off and lay in the sunshine or ride a bike or swim or just enjoy what Benjamin Franklin called "the air bath"– his recommended practice of laying naked in the open air for an hour a day. See people – scrawny, broad, dimpled, pimpled, <span class="italic">beautiful</span> people from 8 to 108 being naked just because and not judging each other at all... Feel the sun on your breasts and give yourself a love bath. Walk among others similarly attired and 99.8% won’t have a thing to say – you are just a body among bodies, free with no shame.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Heal old traumas in the body</span></span>. All of the violent messages, imagery, dysmorphia, lack of relevant and meaningful comparison points, abuse, injury – let it fall away. Develop a practice of appreciation, gratitude and genuine <span class="italic">feeling</span> of being in your body – how the breath moves, how the limbs move, and become free. Any combination of awareness, yogic exercise and breathwork will help you let go of those things which don’t serve you.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Show your body love through action.</span></span>  When you love someone or something, you start caring for it, you bring it nice things, you polish it, nurture it, do nice things for it. Take it out to play! Let your love for your body come out naturally – not as a compulsive desire to fix something or get somewhere, but lovingly and kindly from a place of joy.  Change through effort stemming from joy, not from a desire to get somewhere for any other reason.</p><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Show your love through kind words and appreciation.</span></span> The same goes for praise and appreciation. Whenever you hear the old tape in your head saying something like “I am so fat!” counteract it with 3 positive mantras: "This body serves me well, and lets me paint. It lets me climb on the roof, and I am damn happy in the sack." Practice self-massage, giving gratitude for all the parts from toe to crown.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Your body is a plaything for the spirit. Even in saying "I am working on myself", you acknowledge the duality of the spirit, the I, the self, as separate from the body. In moments of peak meditation or tantric experience, you can catch a glimpse behind the veil of the body, seeing to the bottomless depths of another person’s soul. Your senses allow experience.  Imagine your body as a hula hoop swirling around the soul.  Enjoy it, marvel at what it can do, how it works; engage it with the world around you in every possible way.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>
