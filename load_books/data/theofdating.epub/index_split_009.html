<p class="calibre_2"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Fulfillment is a feeling, not a person</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              The most common question I get from my readers is <span class="italic">"How do I get this guy?"</span>  The answer is simple: you're asking the wrong question.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Deep down, women seek relationships not because they want a particular guy, but rather because they want the feelings that a good relationship brings them.  This class of feelings I call <span class="italic">fulfillment</span>.  Fulfillment is having someone to see that movie with, someone to cook dinner for (or to cook for you), someone to take with you to your best friend's wedding, someone to cuddle up with on a Friday night.</p><p class="calibre_5">              A big mistake in relationships is focusing on the person instead of the fulfillment.  The object of your desire could be the most exceptional man on earth, but if he lives 5 hours away or is a workaholic and is never around when you want his company, chances are you are not going to be fulfilled in the long run.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              When you are dating someone, ask yourself often, "Do I feel fulfilled in this relationship?" and answer that question with utter honesty.  If the answer is 'no' at any point, you may wish to reconsider your situation.  The flip side of that is when you <span class="italic">do</span> feel fulfilled for the most part, but there are some points of conflict looming in your mind.  In that case, you may wish to weigh the relative importance of those peccadilloes compared to the fulfillment you're already experiencing. </p><p class="calibre_5">              Another issue with seeking out a particular man as the key to your fulfillment is that by doing so, you are denying the abundance of the world.  When you chase anything in life, you are affirming its lack in your life.  Spiritual law holds that the world tends to mirror your dominant thoughts.  So if you affirm the lack of something in your life, be it wealth, companionship or health, the world will agree with you, and that thing will be driven farther away from your reach.  We'll discuss this topic further in Chapter 5 on Beliefs.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Now one sure way to chase away your own fulfillment is to compare yourself to others:  Jane has a better-looking, better-educated boyfriend who cooks for her; Barbara's boyfriend is marriage-minded, etc.  Comparison gets you in trouble because comparing yourself with those whom you perceive as better off can make you bitter.  Comparison with those whom you perceive as worse off can make you vain (and frankly, bitter and vain people are a bit of a drag to be around).  If you’re ever going to compare, compare yourself to your former self, and notice how far you have come along.  And stay centered on your fulfillment, which will be different from that of anyone else.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The power of gratitude</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              So what constitutes a more effective approach than wishing, wanting, needing, and yearning your way into a fulfilling relationship?  The secret weapon here is called gratitude.  The idea is simple: right now, if you are sitting somewhere and reading this book, chances are you have a roof over your head and are clothed and fed.  You probably have a job and friends and family who care for you.  Trillions of cellular operations are all working in harmony this very second to keep you alive and functioning.  There is <span class="italic">no end</span> to the things you could be grateful for.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Of course, you have a choice.  You could focus on what's missing from your life – a 70-ft yacht on the French Riviera, a villa in Tuscany or a doting, movie-star boyfriend or husband.  Or you can focus on the infinitude of things that are <span class="italic">right</span> with your life (and there are billions of them, I assure you).  Focusing on the billions of things that are right with your life is more likely to make you feel good than focusing on the few things that you perceive as missing.  Try this fun little exercise to get a better sense of what I mean.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_10"><span class="bold">Exercise 1. The Power of Focus</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Take about 30 seconds right now to look around the room.  Take notice and mentally catalog everything in the room that is <span class="italic">brown</span>, and do your best to remember as many of them as possible.  Look around and do that now; when you are done, continue reading.  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now, while keeping your eye on the page, recall all the items in the room that are <span class="italic">green</span>.  Green?  Yes, green.  You probably didn’t come up with many, since you were so focused on the brown stuff.  You tend to get more of what you focus on.  So choose to focus on the good stuff, and you’ll have no choice but to get more of it.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Gratitude feels good.  Gratitude may be the most empowering feeling you can have.  And it's always there, even when you think it isn't.  All you have to do is to choose to focus on what's good in your life.  In his moving book <span class="italic">Man's Search for Meaning</span>, Viktor Frankl recounts how even in the midst of the unimaginable brutality of a Nazi concentration camp, he was able to find things to be grateful for: the companionship of his friends in camp; a moment of solitude; the savoring of a dry morsel of bread.  So when you’re feeling down, it can be helpful to remind yourself of how good you really do have it compared to what could be.</p><p class="calibre_5">              You can even feel gratitude for the relationship that you would like to have.  The fact is that the person with whom you'll be sharing this relationship is already out there somewhere, and it's only a matter of time before you meet or recognize him.  Think of it as a paycheck that you've already worked for and is coming to you sooner or later; you're sure it's coming, just not exactly<span class="italic"> when</span> it's coming.  And you're okay with that.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              When you feel gratitude, you feel good, and when you feel good, you glow.  Other people will gravitate towards you.  There is no more attractive force than being an epicenter of positive feeling.  So gratitude becomes the magnet that will draw the right person into your life.  As Tenzin Gyatso, the 13th Dalai Lama famously noted, "There is no way to happiness; happiness is the way."</p><p class="calibre_5">              Another neat feature of gratitude is that it tends to be its own reward.  Feelings don't come with little color-coded flags saying <span class="italic">this is the name of what you are feeling.</span>  For example, what you may think of as fear you could just as easily re-interpret as excitement or anticipation.  Similarly, gratitude feels a lot like fulfillment; in fact, it may be the essence of what fulfillment is.  So when you consciously choose to feel gratitude, you're bringing fulfillment into your life on demand.  And when you have that feeling of fulfillment and the empowerment that comes with it, you may no longer feel that you really <span class="italic">need</span> a man, since you already have the feelings that he would bring.  However, you may still <span class="italic">want</span> a man, which is a much more empowered position to operate from than needing one.  More on that later.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">The Be-Do-Have Paradigm</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Most people are seeking some kind of result in life, and believe that success means <span class="italic">having</span> that result, be it wealth, status, relationships.  As such, they’re often looking for the shortcut, the quick and dirty solution, the overnight scheme.  Sure, there are overnight schemes; the problem is that they also tend to last only overnight.  Easy come, easy go.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              True success, on the other hand, is not an accident; it is a <span class="italic">habit</span>.  Most lottery winners go back to their original or lower level of wealth just two years after winning all that money; many go bankrupt.  True success only comes from embarking on a path of mastery, which takes time and effort.  By purchasing this book and reading this far, you have taken the first and second steps on that path.  For that I congratulate you.  Seventy percent of people don’t even make it this far<a></a><a href="index_split_000.html#filepos171">[*]</a>.  Keep up the good work.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Most people think of success in terms of possession: in order to <span class="italic">be</span> someone, you must <span class="italic">have</span> something.  If you have money and spend lots of it, you are rich.  If you have an attractive mate, you are successful in dating.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The truth is that the <span class="italic">reverse</span> of this mindset is the true key to success.  All great works of spirituality from the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span> to the Bible emphasize that the first step of success is to embody the vision of the success you want to have: "As you believe, so it is done unto you."  A simple and powerful articulation of this is the Be-Do-Have paradigm, in which success comes from possessing the mindset, “I am a successful person.”  This in turn leads to actions.  The actions then manifest the signs that people commonly refer to as success.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There is a long-standing tradition in Eastern wisdom of being detached from results.  As Krishna said to Arjuna in the <span class="italic">Bhagavad Gita</span>, you are entitled to your actions, not the results of your actions.  Here’s the insight: if you are following the path of fulfillment, then the <span class="italic">action is the result</span>.  The work is the wealth.  As Mahatma Gandhi put it, “Full effort is full victory.”      </p><p class="calibre_5">              Let’s use the example of money.  In order to be wealthy, first you must <span class="italic">be</span> a wealthy person, with the attendant mindsets and beliefs.  You wake up in the morning thinking, “How would Warren Buffett spend his day?”  Once you have convinced your brain that you are a wealthy person, then you will naturally <span class="italic">do</span> what a wealthy person does – do your homework, make good decisions, have shrewd associates, be thrifty in your ways, have overall welfare in mind.  And, as a result, not only will you  effortlessly <span class="italic">have</span> what a wealthy person possesses, but you will also have the true wealth of following a path of fulfillment.  This is true of any sphere of endeavor.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">You rise to a higher level of consciousness by taking your attention away from your present limitations and placing it upon that which you desire to be.  Do not attempt this in day-dreaming or wishful thinking but in a positive manner.  Claim yourself to be the thing desired.  I AM that; no sacrifice, no diet, no human tricks.  All that is asked of you is to accept your desire.  If you dare claim it, you will express it.  </span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              – Neville, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Your Faith Is Your Fortune</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, Marie Curie was always the brilliant Nobel-winning scientist, even when she was a young, penniless nanny.  When she inhabited that 18-year old mind and body without access to knowledge of her future, she may have never imagined turning into one of the greatest scientists in history and the winner of two Nobel prizes.  Yet to us, it seems strange to think of her any other way than <span class="italic">the</span> Marie Curie, regardless of her age.  You can apply that example to the young versions of any great person in history.  The young Eleanor Roosevelt, Jane Austen, and Indira Gandhi all harbored self-doubt in their development towards greatness.  Yet, in retrospect, they were great to us even as young women on the journey.  Recognize that you are on that same journey of greatness, and that it takes a little bit of time for the greatness to fully manifest.</p><p class="calibre_5">              So now I invite you to envision the most brilliant vision of your future.  Where do you see yourself in 10 years?  In twenty?  What will you accomplish?  How do you want to be remembered?  What kind of relationships will you have?  With what kind of people?  Make that vision as grand as possible, and then start to embody it immediately.  Re-read the quote from Neville above.  Is there a guarantee that all the details of your vision will come true?  Perhaps not 100%.  But <span class="italic">without</span> the vision, there is hardly a chance of achieving the goal.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So dare to think and imagine.  No one has access to your thoughts, so make them as big and brilliant and inspiring as possible.  Great thoughts cost as much as mediocre ones, so might as well go big.  Now is a good time to do the following exercise.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_10"><span class="bold">Exercise 2. Your highest vision of yourself</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Take a deep breath and close your eyes.  Imagine yourself as a child, maybe 7 years old.  Remember then how badly you wanted to grow up, be tall, go places like the grownups, reach high shelves, drive a car.  Remember that feeling of inadequacy that you had then and how you just couldn’t wait for all this to happen.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now bring a picture of your current adult self into the scene, and give your child self a big hug saying, “Hey, told you it was all going to be all right.”  Feel that deep compassion and acceptance.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now imagine a third version of yourself – a version from the future that embodies all the accomplishments and goals you are seeking right now.  What does that person look like?  Really take the time to notice her voice, her gait, her demeanor.  How does she look and sound?  How does it feel to be her?  Now have that future you come in and give the present you a big hug, saying “It’s all going to be all right,” just the way you hugged the 7-year old you.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">              Now let the three pictures of you from the past, present and the future merge into one another, leaving an image of that highest vision of yourself, and realize that it is you, right now.  When you feel the empowering feelings that brings, squeeze your left fist twice.  From now on, all you have to do to bring that empowering feeling back is to repeat that double squeeze.   </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              In this chapter, we will break down the Be-Do-Have paradigm into four practical components: right beliefs, leading to right attitudes, leading to right behaviors, which naturally flow into right results.  The steps go from the more hidden to the more manifest.  Beliefs and attitudes are the <span class="italic">be</span> phase; attitudes and behaviors are the <span class="italic">do</span> phase; results are the <span class="italic">have</span> phase.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              <span class="italic">Beliefs</span> are completely hidden, not even manifest to the trained eye.  Since your beliefs are yours to know alone, it makes sense to have the most effective beliefs possible, as grandiose or foolhardy as they may sound.  Strong, empowering beliefs cost as much as mediocre, ineffective ones: they’re all free!<a></a><a href="index_split_000.html#filepos171">[2]</a>  So use the beliefs that serve you best.</p><p class="calibre_5">              An <span class="italic">attitude</span> is the first-level manifestation of a belief, hardly detectable even to a trained observer.  Sometimes it is expressed verbally or in body language; other times it manifests itself as the subtext of behavior.  People tend to respond not to your hidden thoughts or to your manifest behavior, but rather to your overall attitude.  Your attitude is the meta-message and meaning of your behavior.</p><p class="calibre_5">              <span class="italic">Behavior</span> is what you do, which is easy to observe.  The range of possible behaviors is infinite, yet most of us operate within a narrow envelope of behavior which those who know us call our personality.  When we do something that seems to breach that narrow envelope, they say that we are behaving ‘out of character.’  Behavioral range is determined by attitudes and beliefs.  It is possible to change attitudes and beliefs by regularly engaging in new behaviors consistent with those new beliefs.   </p><p class="calibre_5">              <span class="italic">Results</span> are the most manifest component of the process.  Results broadcast themselves just fine yet reveal little useful information regarding how to achieve them.  Knowing how much wealth someone has does not help you get rich like them; nor does seeing that someone has a wonderful companion tell you how that came about.  This may seem obvious, but most people find themselves motivated by observing the results and not the process by which they came into being.  So henceforth, in all spheres of life, wherever you observe success, look at the <span class="italic">process</span>.  That is where the true wealth resides.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

they are essential to your survival and health.  Now you may <span class="italic">want</span> a man, and that's okay (and in any case, men are much more flattered when they are wanted rather than needed). </p><p class="calibre_5">              However, a man is not a panacea.  If you're in a bad job situation, don't get along with your family, have financial troubles, or fundamentally aren't happy with yourself, a man in your life is not likely to solve those issues, no matter how fantastic he is.  A man can at best be a conduit and catalyst for feelings of fulfillment.  Keep in mind especially that all feelings that you have, <span class="italic">you</span> generate inside your head.  There is no wire from the outside world that plugs into the back of your head and makes you have feelings.  If there is one person in the world chiefly responsible for your feelings, it's you.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Daniel Gilbert of Harvard studies <span class="italic">affective forecasting</span>, our ability to predict how we will feel in the future in response to events.  What he has found is that, a few months down the road from the event, we don’t feel nearly as good as we thought we would about pleasant things, nor feel nearly as bad about negative ones.  In other words, we overestimate both our happiness and distress in response to future events.  A year after an event, we tend to return to the same baseline level of happiness we had before.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Finding a suitable male companion may be likened to winning the lottery.  Most women desirous of a relationship think they would be <span class="italic">really</span> happy if they started dating a wonderful man, in the same way that most people think they'd be really happy if they won a lottery.  The fact is, soon after winning a lottery, the winners tend to return to the baseline level of happiness they had before winning.  It's reasonable to conclude that the level of contentment and happiness you feel, after the initial whirlwind of excitement in a relationship has settled, is the same as the one you are experiencing right now in your seat while reading this passage.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There is a spiritual principle in operation here, reiterated in many guises in numerous traditions, but its essence is this: <span class="italic">You have everything that you need</span>. Right here, right now.  Now this may be challenging to grasp, as you wonder about unpaid bills, an empty fridge and all that extra room in your bed at night.  But at a deep and fundamental level, it is always true. At every point in your life leading to this moment, you have had everything that you <span class="italic">needed</span> (once gain, emphasizing need rather than want): a womb in which the cells of your body multiplied and grew, caregivers to raise you, a nervous system that was capable of learning language, movement and other complex tasks, and the inner resources to succeed at school, work and human relations.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              However, let's leave alone the factual accuracy of whether or not you have everything that you need and play pretend for a moment: What if that were actually true?  How would that make you feel?  What kind of person would you be if you truly believed that you have everything that you need?  And what kind of people would you draw into your life if you were that person?  <span class="italic">Start there</span>.  In the chapter on beliefs, we will delve deeper into how beliefs empower you and bring you more of what you want.</p><p class="calibre_2"></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_9"></div>
