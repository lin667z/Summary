<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Chapter 9. Meet</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">To initiate or not to initiate</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Approaching an unfamiliar member of the same species is an anxiety-provoking event across the animal kingdom.  Add this to the unwritten social edict not to approach men, and it becomes very rare indeed for a woman to say hi to a man first.</p><p class="calibre_5">              It follows that if you are one of those rare women who is willing to initiate contact with a man, then you are in a position to meet many, many appreciative men.  Occasionally you will meet the man who does not welcome your approach for whatever reason (in which case it's a good time to remember again the second of the <span class="italic">Four Agreements</span> of Don Miguel Ruiz: <span class="italic">take nothing personally</span>).  However, the right kind of man – the man with heart and spine who has excellent self-esteem – will always appreciate your approach for many reasons.  It demonstrates your courage, strength, independence of spirit – and your good taste in men, since you've chosen him.   </p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's the irony: researchers have shown that in the dating arena, women often <span class="italic">are</span> the initiators of contact – two-thirds of the time (Moore, 1985).  It's just that they're doing it unconsciously rather than deliberately, covertly rather than overtly, nonverbally rather than verbally.  A casual glance and a smile in the direction of a man, a flipping of the hair, a turning of the body towards him – these are the subtle but unmistakable invitations to the man indicating your openness to interact.  (Of course, after you've been married for years, he'll tell the story of how <span class="italic">he</span> was the one who got it all started – cute.)</p><p class="calibre_5">              Psychologist Monica Moore observed over 200 women at a party and categorized their successful moves to initiate interaction (technically known as their <span class="italic">nonverbal solicitation signals</span>).  She found 52 of them, some of which I list here in order of frequency of occurrence at the party:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Smiling at him broadly (most common by a huge margin)</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Throwing him a short, darting glance</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Dancing alone to the music</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Looking straight at him and flipping hair </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Keeping a fixed gaze on him </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Looking at him, tossing head, then looking back</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• "Accidentally" brushing up against him</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Nodding at him</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Pointing to a chair and inviting him to sit</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Tilting head and touching exposed neck</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Licking lips during eye contact </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Primping while keeping eye contact with him</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Parading close with exaggerated hip movement</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Asking for his help with something</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Tapping something to get his attention</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8">• Patting his buttocks</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              What Moore found was that the more frequently a woman signaled, the more likely she was to get a positive outcome.  In fact, the frequency of signaling overrode physical attractiveness as a success factor.  In other words, a high-signaling woman of average attractiveness was much more likely to be approached than a prettier but low-signaling counterpart.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Use the tiered approach</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              So let me make this clear: your job in getting the ball rolling is to broadcast receptivity to his approach early and often. Your receptivity is the feminine yin function which allows the masculine yang function of action to manifest.  The man's job is to perceive your receptivity signals on his mental radar.  In case a man misses these signals, you can escalate the signal from the subtle to the more obvious until he gets it.  The <span class="italic">tiered approach </span>involves simply observing what these signals are, then using them deliberately, progressing from the covert to the overt until you make contact or ascertain a lack of interest.               </p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's a suggested sequence for the tiered approach.  Feel free to improvise and expand on it, since you are already far better at this than I will ever be.  If the first step doesn't yield the results you want, escalate to the next one until you <span class="italic">do</span> get the results you want.  And remember – discovering that the man is a poor fit for you is also a positive result, since it means you can now focus your energies elsewhere:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">1) Start by turning your body towards him, especially your knees, and smiling at him broadly.  Supplementing this with mild hair-twirling amplifies the effect.  In this day and age, most guys know that hair-twirling = flirtation.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">2) Throw occasional glances in his direction without actually making eye contact.  If you are in his field of vision and he's even remotely interested, he will notice this.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">3) Next level of escalation is to look him directly in the eye.  A friendly smile to go along with it is the most inviting.  A challenging look – the come hither look, bedroom eyes, whatever you want to call it – may be too much for most men and scare them away.  Remember, you just want to get a conversation started, not to have him abduct you to his cave.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">4) Next is to initiate conversation.  Many women ask, "Well, what do I say to him?", and the simple answer is: <span class="italic">absolutely anything</span>.  When a woman initiates the conversation with a man, a guy instinctively knows she is showing interest, and he <span class="italic">will</span> pick up that ball and run with it.  And if he does not, then clearly he's not the right man.  We’ll talk about this more in the next section.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">5) Touch him 'accidentally'.  It's virtually impossible not to get some kind of response out of a man if you bump into him, so if you're bold enough to use this technique, it has a very high success rate.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">6) Wave at him, or wave him over.  If you're feeling daring, this will get a positive response out of a man if he's interested even in the least.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">7) If none of these work, just grab him by the collars and plant a big smooch on his lips.  If that still doesn't work, congratulations – you have done your part.  Feel free to focus your attentions elsewhere.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to help men approach you </span></p><p class="calibre_5">              In addition to the tiered approach (remember to smile!), here are some guidelines that will enhance your chances of being approached, especially by a Good Guy:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Have a distinguisher.</span></span>  Guys are dying for an excuse to talk to you – so give them one!  A distinguisher is simply an item that is likely to get noticed, setting you apart from the crowd.  A fancy brooch, a funny t-shirt, a pink ribbon in your hair, a flower above your ear, a fancy gadget, an intriguing book, seed for the pigeons – these are all perfectly legitimate distinguishers.  Remember, the distinguisher is supposed to make it easier for a guy to approach, not harder.  Accentuating your cleavage may get you noticed more but not approached more.  Which brings us to...</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Dress to the sevens, not the nines.</span></span>  Dress your sexy best, but not overwhelmingly so.  Even confident guys can lose their bearings when overwhelmed with much skin, cleavage and leg.  Also, Good Guys tend to be a little intimidated by (and wary of) really glammed-up women, while the players will fearlessly march forward.  By dressing to the sevens, you also leave a little room for turning up the dial later when there's a real date.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Go out in groups of three women or less.</span></span>  It takes a particularly courageous man to dive straight into a gaggle of stylish women and just start talking to one of them.  Even really outgoing guys get intimidated doing that – it just doesn't look like a welcoming setup.  Besides, the more women there are in a group, the less attention any one of them can get.  So why willfully reduce your chances?  Go out with one or two girlfriends maximum.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Don't go out with guy friends.</span></span>  Unless your guy buddy is an exceptionally adept wingman, I would advise against going out with him with the intention of meeting other men.  Especially if he's good-looking.  If I see you with a guy, I will assume he is your boyfriend, brother or protector unless proven otherwise.  Which means that I'm much more likely to speak to a woman without a bodyguard.  If you are going to step out with your guy buddy anyway, make it clear through body language and distance that he's not an impediment to other men's approach.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Situate yourself in an accessible place.</span></span>  Let's say you're in the corner of an art gallery, with your back to the wall, chatting with three of your friends.  Under those conditions, it's almost physically impossible for a guy to approach you without being intrusive.  Same goes for sitting at tables in clubs, having your back to the men who'd like to meet you, or clinging too tight to the people you came with.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Wear shoes that are comfortable </span></span><span class="italic"><span class="bold"><span class="underline">and</span></span></span><span class="italic"><span class="bold"> look good.</span></span>  I know you love your shoes, and they make you feel sexy and empowered – chest forward, butt out, calves flexed, thighs tight, more height.  And nobody's asking you to turn into a frump here.  But consider this: there's no better way to wipe a smile off your face than having your feet in pain – <span class="italic">all night long</span>.  And a frown on your face just makes it that much harder for a guy to say hi.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              With shoes that are killing your feet, you're also robbing yourself of the chance of a dance or walk that could make the evening.  Your mobility and flexibility empower you more than 3 inches added to your height and a hobbled gait.  And when you willfully take away your own ability to walk more than three steps, you will most likely irritate even the most gallant of men – trust me on this count.</p><p class="calibre_5">               Uncomfortable shoes, no matter how hot they make you look, tend to take away more options than they give you (and guys couldn't care less what brand they are).  And they kind of beat up your body.  For an evening, pick shoes that look good <span class="italic">and</span> feel good.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to initiate conversations</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Remember that <span class="italic">anything</span> that you say is sufficient to get the ball rolling, so there's no need to get fancy or overly flirtatious here.  That way, if you find that you need to end the interaction early, you can do so effortlessly and graciously.  Innocent enough topics of conversation that women have used to successfully initiate conversation with yours truly:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">1) A comment on an item of clothing (e.g. "Nice ring/hat/shirt, where did you get it", etc).  You are a woman, and it's perfectly normal for you to be interested in such things.  And if the man has a sense of style, he'll appreciate your compliment and take it from there.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">2) Ask him for some kind of help ("Do you know where the bathroom is?", "Could you please hand me a napkin?").  Men are nurturers by instinct, so you are engaging their noblest nature when you ask them for assistance.  No man will be able to refuse a simple request like that, and he'll feel six inches taller for having been helpful. </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">3) Ask him a factual question or for his opinion.  Men are vast repositories of mostly useless facts and entirely useless opinions, so this approach has an excellent chance of success.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">4) Tell him that he looks familiar and you're wondering where you may have met before.  Although this may seem a tad disingenuous if you really haven't seen the fellow before, it's almost never interpreted as such by the man.  In the process of figuring out where you have or have not met, you often find that you really do have things in common, and you can take it from there.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The importance of intention</span></p><p class="calibre_5">A key aspect of moving with the Tao and having the Tao help you along in your quest is <span class="italic">intention</span>.  Most of the techniques in this book will work regardless of your intention vis-à-vis the men you meet – anywhere from “I want to meet the man I can cherish for the rest of my life” to “I want to have a one-night stand.”  However, <span class="italic">The Tao of Dating</span> will work most effectively when you have a strong <span class="italic">positive</span> intention which incorporates the beliefs we discussed in Chapter 4, the most important of which being "the world is a reflection of me."  </p><p class="calibre_5">So if you approach the dating arena with the attitude “What’s in it for me?  What can I get out of this?,” the world will respond by saying right back to you, “What’s in it for me?,” and you will encounter scarcity (or meet men who share the ‘taking’ mindset with you).  You will be much more effective if you approach with an attitude of <span class="italic">giving</span>
<span class="italic">and sharing</span>: “How can I serve?  How can I enrich my environment?  How can I bring something to this man’s world that was missing before?”  </p><p class="calibre_5">The fact is that you <span class="italic">are</span> bringing something valuable to a man’s life – your warmth, your caring, your wit, your beauty, your interest, your <span class="italic">presence</span>.  You are a woman.  Wars have been fought over you, tomes have been written about you, monuments have been built to you.  When you truly believe the value of your presence, it becomes very easy to have the positive intent of bringing that value into someone else's life.  The more positive your intent, the less energy you have to expend hiding it, and the more energy you free up to be more effective and have more fun.  </p><p class="calibre_5">You may think of the powerful positive intent (PPI) as a noble stance and a way to be good.  But that is not necessarily the way of the Tao: the Tao finds all enforced nobility and goodness suspect: </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A truly good woman is unaware of her goodness;</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Thus she is truly good.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A foolish woman tries to be good,</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">And is therefore not good.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A truly good woman does nothing,</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Yet leaves nothing to be undone.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">A foolish woman is always doing,</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Yet leaves much undone…</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              When the Tao is lost, there is kindness.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              When kindness is lost, there is morality.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              When morality is lost, there is ritual.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              Ritual is the mere husk of loyalty and promise-keeping,</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">              The beginning of chaos.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9"> </span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Therefore the truly good woman dwells on reality, </span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">Not the surface.  On the fruit, and not the flower.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">So take one and reject the other.</span></span><br class="calibre1"/><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">                                          – Lao Tzu, </span></span><span class="calibre_9">Tao Te Ching</span><span class="italic"><span class="calibre_9">, Ch. 38</span></span></p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">Rather, think of the PPI as another manifestation of enlightened self-interest: this is the way because it is more <span class="italic">effective</span>.  The Tao would much rather have you be effective than good.  The following exercise demonstrates how powerful positive intent empowers you.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 13. Powerful Positive Intent (PPI)</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Imagine that you are on a sidewalk and you see an unusually handsome man.  You find him very attractive, and would like to speak to him.  Notice how you feel about approaching him.  Do you go right up and speak to him, or is there some hesitation?  Are you certain that he will immediately like you, or is there some doubt?  Now imagine that a crazed cyclist is coming behind him and is clearly about to hit him.  Now how much hesitation do you have to yell <span class="italic">“Watch out!”</span> at the top of your lungs and move him out of harm’s way?  How much doubt do you have?  What is different from the first scenario?  What if you were to bring the same powerful positive intent as in the second scenario every time you meet a man?  How would that change your behavior?   How much more effective would you be in your interactions with men?  </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              <a></a>Below are some more examples of PPI statements from other women who have had some great relationships.  Notice how they all have <span class="italic">sharing</span> as an explicit or implicit theme.  Use them as suggestions to craft your own PPI:</p><p class="calibre_5">“I want to share my joy of life.”</p><p class="calibre_5">“I want to provide the support that allows a man to blossom and grow beyond what even he himself thought possible.”</p><p class="calibre_5">“I want to create a home full of love, abundance and joy with a great partner.”</p><p class="calibre_5">“I love everything about men and want to express my deep appreciation of them.”</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 14. Craft your own PPI to act with greater authority and integrity</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Write your very own PPI.  It should start with “I …”, be brief, and easy to remember.  Make it big and bold.  Make sure it resonates deeply with who you are and what you believe.  Stick a little clause about sharing if you can.  You know you have a good one if it leaves the world a better place when applied universally.  Remember it every time you are out meeting men – maybe even keep a copy of it in your purse.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">From reading the previous chapter, you now have a sense of the kind of man you’d like to meet and where he is likely to be found.  But before we go into further detail on where to meet men, we will go over one of the most pivotal concepts in this book: the Pipeline of Abundance.  The most important mindset in this book is that of <span class="italic">wealth-consciousness</span> – noticing the sheer abundance surrounding you at all times.  The mental exercises provide the foundation for the mindset; validating it in the real world cements it in, making it permanent.  </p><p class="calibre_5">You validate the mindset by meeting men all the time.  The more quality men you know, the more options you will have for dating, and the less hungry (or scarcity-conscious) you will be about them.  So celebrate abundance and always welcome new men into your life.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 15. The Cookies Experiment</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Let’s say you have twenty cookies right now.  Would you give me one if I asked for it?  Chances are you would.  What if I asked for two?  For three?  Twenty cookies are far more than you can eat, so unless you’re unusually greedy, you would be willing to part with even three.  Now let’s say for some reason you lose 19 of your cookies and you’re left with one.  Now how do you feel about giving me that last cookie?  How is your attitude different?  </blockquote><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The three-man plan</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              From the cookies experiment, it's easy to see how our behavior changes when confronted with perceived scarcity.  The more choices you have, the freer you'll feel.  And this bears directly upon your behavior – in the case of the cookies, being generous or stingy, abundance-conscious or scarcity-conscious.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Similarly, in the dating arena, it's important to have options.  So I encourage you to be dating at least two, ideally three men at any given time.  No, you won't be a slut for doing so.  And you don't have to get physically intimate with all three or any of them.  But having three men or so in a rotation is great for many reasons.</p><p class="calibre_5">              First of all, dating is a skill that improves with practice.  The more men you interact with, the better you understand them, and the better you figure out what matters in a companion.  That's fairly invaluable all by itself.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Second, imagine this scenario.  You're applying for jobs.  You get several interviews, but only one company offers you a position.  How much leverage will you have when negotiating your salary?  Not much – you're completely at their mercy.  Now imagine that you have <span class="italic">three</span> job offers.  How much leverage do you have now?  Exactly.  Dating more than one man at a time gives you latitude and keeps you from ever feeling needy.  Since two is only one step away from desperate, three is the ideal number to keep your attitude self-sufficient and abundant without letting things get too out of hand.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Becoming Rejection-Proof  I: Re-write your rule</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              We briefly touched upon this before: how do you know for sure when a given man has rejected you?  Is it a particular sequence of words that he says, or some facial gesture of his?  Or maybe it’s a feeling you get – if so, where does it start?  Can you describe it?  Most people don’t really have a concrete answer to these questions.  And each woman I’ve met can come up with examples of when she <span class="italic">thought</span> she was being rejected but really wasn’t.  My point is this: you probably don’t have a hard-and-fast rule for knowing when you’ve been rejected.  And usually it has to do with some external factor ("He said this", "He didn't return my phone call") rather than some internal rubric having to do with you.</p><p class="calibre_5">              So may I suggest that <span class="italic">right now</span> you establish your rule for rejection which establishes when you know beyond doubt that you have been rejected.  And since you’re the one writing it, may I suggest that you make the rule such that a) <span class="italic">your</span> behavior decides it, not external events and b) you effectively make it impossible to be rejected.                </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, my personal rule for rejection is this: “I know I am rejected if I know unequivocally that I acted maliciously towards someone.”  Since I generally don’t act maliciously, I have effectively made it impossible for me to reject myself.  </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><blockquote class="calibre_12"><span class="bold">Exercise 16.  Write your personal rule to make rejection an impossibility</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_11">Write your rule for rejection, starting with the statement “I know I am rejected if…”.  Then put in there the action <span class="italic">you </span>have to take in order to know that you have been rejected.  Feel free to use variations on the example used above.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold">Becoming Rejection-Proof II: Re-framing</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One very useful technique in hypnosis and neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) is <span class="italic">re-framing</span>.  Since we have considerable latitude in interpreting the meaning of events – free to pick positive, neutral or negative ones – we should pick meanings that are most useful to us.  The useful interpretations will tend to make us feel better and be more effective, while the negative ones have the opposite effect.  And remember – the Tao's pulling for you to be more effective.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, you can interpret a police car on the side of the road as “He’s there to get me,” or “He’s there to keep the neighborhood safe”, and you will have different feelings associated with each interpretation.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              When it comes to dealing with men, if you feel you may have been rejected, instead of thinking “That guy must not really like me” or “I must be an awful person,” try thinking this: “I never get rejected – I only find out which men have excellent taste.  And if he says no, he has done me a great service by saving me time and effort.”  Notice how with this re-frame, you can actually <span class="italic">feel good</span> about rejection and use the event as a positive impetus to meet even better men.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Here’s an example of re-framing dealing with a common dating situation: a man takes his sweet time to call you, either after taking your number or after a first date.  A neutral interpretation of the situation would be to imagine that he dropped his phone in a bucket of water and lost your number.  A negative interpretation would be that he didn’t think you had chemistry.  A positive interpretation would be that he was so overwhelmed by your charm, elegance and beauty that he’s too intimidated to call you.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Each of these three situations have happened to me and probably to many other men, so they’re not entirely fictional.  Yet notice how your reaction to them is different.  So feel free to pick the neutral or positive re-frame henceforth.</p><p class="calibre_5">The other powerful reframe you can use is to imagine each approach not as an opportunity for success or failure, but as a chance to <span class="italic">see what happens</span>.  Approach the situation not with a do-or-die mentality, but rather with endless curiosity.  A time-honored saying in NLP is that there is no failure – only feedback.  And since <span class="italic">something</span> is going to happen 100% of the time, you are <span class="italic">guaranteed</span> feedback and cannot possibly fail!  I find this reframe to be one of the most powerful.  It just enlivens the dating process (or anything else in life, for that matter).  It provides the motivation to open yourself up to wonder and to imagine what that gift-wrapped box of possibility holds as you just wait to see what happens next.  Always remember that dating is supposed to be fun.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
