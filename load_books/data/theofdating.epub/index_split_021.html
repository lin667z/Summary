<p class="calibre_5"><span class="calibre2"><span class="bold">Chapter 11. Romance, or what to do on a date</span></span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Stoking the fires</span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">              </span>So you found a Good Guy.  Congratulations.  And you've managed to set up some time to spend together.  This chapter is about specific things you can do to make those dates go exceptionally well, so you are in control of your destiny and in the best position to have a fulfilling interaction, however you define that for yourself.  The prior chapter had the essential principles behind creating powerful, lasting attraction between you and the man – which, properly utilized, are more than enough.  To ensure that you are as empowered as possible, I'd also like to share with you some specific techniques to empower you even further.  This is beyond hair-flipping or lip-licking – that stuff you already know and don't need a guy to teach you.  This is subtler business.</p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Rapport</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One of my hypnosis teachers once said about personal interactions, “Inside of rapport, anything is possible; outside of rapport, nothing is possible.”  In sales, persuasion, relationships, or any kind of human transaction, rapport is <span class="italic">the</span> key to effective communication.  If you learn nothing from this book except for how to establish and maintain rapport, you will be miles ahead of the rest of the pack.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              As a woman, if you're practicing the preceding exercises – especially the one about listening – you will naturally be in deep rapport with a man and won't need to practice getting rapport.  However, for the sake of completeness, I want you to have this powerful skill at your disposal.</p><p class="calibre_5">I think of rapport as that familiar feeling of standing next to someone looking out at the rest of the world together, versus sitting facing one another, each with your own point of view.  When you are in rapport, you become like the other person, and people tend to like people who are like themselves.  Entire books have been written on this subject alone, but the essence of these can be conveyed in a small space.  In this section, I will give you a triple treat: the traditional tools for rapport (which you should use regularly), the three secret techniques for rapport, and one counterintuitive method.  </p><p class="calibre_5">The key technique of nonverbal rapport is <span class="italic">mirroring</span>.  If you watch two people in deep conversation, you may notice something eerie: their body postures tend to mirror one another.  The image to keep in mind is that of the tête-à-tête: two people hunched over at a table at the same angle, talking in conspiratorial tones. Basically, you are mimicking the body language of your interlocutor.  You want to do this as closely as possible: he moves his hand, you move yours.  He nods, you nod.  Hardly anyone ever notices when he is being mirrored, because almost all body language is <span class="italic">unconscious</span>, which by definition is what we are not aware of at the conscious level.</p><p class="calibre_5">Which movements of the body are more important?  Where to start?  The proper technique is to match from the macro to the micro.  Start with general body posture, the position of limbs in space, and then move on to motion of hands, feet, fingers, neck angle and facial muscles.  Once you’ve mastered that, you can start to mirror vocal tone, volume and tempo as well.  And finally, for achieving ultra-deep rapport, you want to mirror diction by repeating <span class="italic">verbatim</span> what the person just said.  This is not active listening – this is <span class="italic">word-for-word</span> repetition of what you just heard.  I call this <span class="italic">backtracking</span>, and it's super effective.</p><p class="calibre_5">One of the reasons why these techniques are so useful is that in order to do them right, you must pay complete attention to your companion.  This in itself is enough to engender attraction.</p><p class="calibre_5">Ideally, the nonverbal rapport protocol becomes a habit so ingrained that you use it unconsciously and all the time.  In any case, you should still use the following three secret techniques for creating and enhancing rapport, especially in interactions with less time to establish pacing and leading:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">1)<span class="calibre7">      </span><span class="italic">Assume rapport.</span>  Imagine that the person you’re speaking to is an old friend that you’ve known for at least three years.  The attitude is more along the lines of “Hey, good to see you again, buddy” than “How do you do, sir.”</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">2)<span class="calibre7">     </span><span class="italic">Go into the emotional state of the bond</span>.  What would it <span class="italic">feel</span> like if right now you were to bump into your long-lost friend that you haven’t seen in three years?  How thrilled would you be?  How eager would you be to talk to her?  Summon that same feeling and bring it to the interaction at hand.  </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">3)<span class="calibre7">      </span><span class="italic">Share a secret.</span>  Preface your statement with “Can I tell you a secret?,” then go ahead and share.  It need not be something earth-shattering or embarrassing; it need not even be about you: “I just really appreciate your style” works, as does “I just can’t stand mosquitoes.”  The fact that you prefaced it as being a secret is enough.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">To really grasp rapport, think of your best friend and how you interact with her.  How do you greet each other?  What sort of things do you talk about?  How do you bring up a topic of conversation?  Bring those qualities to the interaction to deepen rapport. </p><p class="calibre_5">In deep rapport, you’re not afraid of losing your audience – you’ve been friends for years, for example – and so you are more willing to antagonize each other, tease one another or be slightly rude.  This brings us to the covert technique which I call the <span class="italic">rapport of anti-rapport</span>.  If right from the outset of an interaction you start playfully teasing someone, the implication is that rapport is already so deep as to permit this.  Paradoxically, this <span class="italic">creates</span> rapport.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Two caveats: first, it’s important to do this <span class="italic">playfully</span> and not too seriously.  Feisty (being contrary in a friendly way) is good; confrontational and hostile less good.  Second, follow up the anti-rapport with the usual rapport techniques, using anti-rapport as the spice rather than the main course.  Every time you do something to deliberately break rapport without actually breaking it, you <span class="italic">strengthen</span> rapport.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to create passion</span></p><p class="calibre_5">Here's one of my favorite paradoxical tidbits of human dating behavior.  The key to creating passion is the presence of <span class="italic">obstacles</span>.  That which is gained with little effort is lost without much regret – easy come, easy go.  Passion, on the other hand, is like water building up behind a dam: the more it builds up, the more urgently it wants to break through and express itself.  It's pent-up energy aching for release.  You don’t get that kind of intensity, the rush of water rolling over things wild and uncontrolled, unless the dam had held it back first.  So in order to create passion, you must do two things: <span class="italic">plant the seed</span>, then <span class="italic">create obstacles</span>, even if they don’t initially exist.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Planting the seed means giving him something to think about.  Ideally you want it to be something that runs in his head over and over again while you’re not around.  A story or well-placed compliment is good for that.  </p><p class="calibre_5">Then create obstacles.  Play up the distance between you.  Set up dates two weeks to a month in advance while building up anticipation for them in the interim.  Or, if you feel particularly daring and dastardly, do all of the above – then postpone the date at the last minute for an extra day or two (<span class="italic">caution</span>: handle with care – more on this soon).  Which would you prefer – a mediocre date tonight, or one next month that’s guaranteed to go extremely well?  Think of the great love stories of history.  The idea of star-crossed lovers is as old as time, and it is precisely because of the seemingly insurmountable barriers between the lovers that the passion intensifies.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_18"><span class="bold">To create passion, plant the seed of attraction, then create obstacles.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to make a man fall in love with you</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              My friend Michelle is a beautiful, sophisticated and exceptionally intelligent woman of about 30 who lives in New York City.  Because she's so damn smart, she doesn't find too many men who can go toe-to-toe with her.  But every once in a while, a keeper comes along.  That's when she gets all excited – and instantly loses her bearings and calls me asking what to do.  I'll never forget the one time she asked me, point-blank, "Ali – how do you make a man fall in love with you?"</p><p class="calibre_5">              Never having had a man fall in love with me, I'm not qualified to answer that question.  However, I have been a man for a while, and have fallen in love with women more than once. From those experiences and my forays into the scientific literature, I've come up with three ways that a man will fall in love with you.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">1) The Natural Way</span></span>.  Consciously or not, every man has a mental archetype of the woman he desires, and once in a blue moon, he comes across that woman.  If that woman happens to be you, and you also find him interesting, hallelujah – let the fireworks begin.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There isn't much you can really do to engineer this kind of love.  A man is attracted to a certain body type, facial look, hair color, smell, cultural background, or any other number of random elements of which even he himself is not fully aware.  You could resemble his first girlfriend from high school.  You could be wearing that one perfume that drives him nuts (because his first girlfriend from high school used to wear it).  Whatever it is, this is the love that cannot be planned.  If it happens, great.  If not, read on.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">2) The Devious Dastardly Way. </span></span>With enough determination, you can make any man fall in love with you, and the procedure is simpler than you think.  It can be summarized in three words: <span class="italic">give, withdraw, repeat.</span>  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Before I elaborate on this, I want to let you know that I consider emotional manipulation of any person to be just plain wrong.  I have been on the receiving end of that kind of treatment, and it was no fun.  So why am I including this manipulative method of making a man fall in love with you if I don't condone it?</p><p class="calibre_5">              I'm including it because I don't believe any woman would use this procedure <span class="italic">consciously</span>.  However, through coincidence and circumstance, a woman could end up using this procedure <span class="italic">unconsciously</span>.  And then she's got a man who's borderline stalking her, and she doesn't understand why.  Now that you know how this works, it's more likely that you can prevent this inconvenience from happening.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's the essence of it.  You start out by giving the man attention.  You appear interested, give him your number, and maybe even set up a date.  You are <span class="italic">giving</span>.  And then – you cancel the date at the last minute. This is <span class="italic">withdrawing</span>, and it puts the man in a tizzy.  He won't understand what happened, and will be hurt and confused.  This is when you call him and apologize profusely (which is different from flaking, when you don’t seem very invested at all).   Some emergency came up, it could not be avoided, you're so sorry, can we reschedule?  You’re showing that you actually cared, but just couldn’t show up.  That's more of the giving.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Usually, he'll be so pleased that you're still interested that he'll accept your apology and agree to reschedule.  Now you have the option of canceling again, or showing up and using the procedure <span class="italic">during</span> the date.  You can be very flirtatious, giving him lots of compliments, touching him here and there, gazing lingeringly deep into his eyes.  You may even give him a kiss on the cheek at some point, or make out with him.  You are <span class="italic">giving</span>.  But you cut the whole procedure short when he least expects it, and leave abruptly – something came up.  You <span class="italic">withdraw</span>.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Once again, he will be frustrated and confused, thinking he was <span class="italic">so</span> close – what went wrong this time?  He will think about you all the time and wait with bated breath for you to call him again.  And with judicious timing, you enter his life again and give a little bit more, only to withdraw it later.  Three rounds of give and withdraw should reduce any man to putty in your hands – if that is what you want.  The man will be completely infatuated with you.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The key to making this work is this: when you are giving, give genuinely.  You really are into him. It's just that something completely unexpected comes up everytime he's on the brink of being on solid ground with you.  And that's when you withdraw completely, yanking the rug out from under him decisively and unequivocally – only to restore it later.  In the case of my friend Brian, a woman broke up and got back together with him three times, each restoration of the relationship accompanied with vehement protestations of undying love (and passionate make-up sex).  To this day, he can't recall being more obsessed with anyone, even though she was trouble.</p><p class="calibre_5">              By now, you see how deeply devious and manipulative this is.  And by now, you may also realize that you may have unwittingly done something like this to some poor sap at some point in your life.  You were initially interested, gave him your number, went out with him once or twice.  But then you got busy – exams, big project at work – and he got relegated to the back of your mind.  Then you thought about him again and responded to him positively, but then withdrew for some reason that wasn't entirely clear even to you.  That's when he started acting clingy and weird, and you decided to ignore him – which, paradoxically, whetted his appetite even more, since you were withdrawing so completely.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So to keep from sending out the wrong signal to men, be more mindful of your actions towards them.  On the other hand, if this is how you wish to nab Mr. Right, just know that you're playing with fire.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">3) The High Road. </span></span>If you are truly interested in a man and want him to grow in love, respect and admiration for you, this is the way to do it.  The method is remarkably simple: bring out the best in him.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              A man will steadily fall more and more in love with a woman who steadily helps him become more and more the man he has always wanted to be.  As we discussed in Chapter 2, this is your opportunity to be the Goddess to his Warrior.  Not only can you nurture the vision that he has of his own greatness, but you can go one step beyond and encourage him to be even bigger than he has imagined himself.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              When you do this, he has no choice but to feel good about himself around you.  He will feel taller, stronger, more capable, more masculine.  And chances are that he's not getting anything like that anywhere else.  Which means that he's more likely to stay with you for the long run.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Great idea, you say.  But how do I do it?  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">How to bring out the best in a man</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              As conscious beings, we have the extraordinary ability to direct our energy according to our will.  According to spiritual principle, energy flows where attention goes, so merely giving your attention to something will make it flourish.  This is particularly true in our interactions with others.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Consider this scenario.  Walk up to a stranger and say, "Why do you have to be such a jerk?"  The most likely reaction you will get from him is, "Well, why don't you go to hell?  You're the one who's being a jerk."  By being nasty to someone, you will bring out and nurture the nastiness in him.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Contrast that with going up to someone and saying sweetly, "You look so nice today."  The most likely response you'll get is something like, "Aww, that's so sweet of you!  You look very nice yourself."  By directing kind energy towards him, you brought out the kindness in him.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              To put this in term of the language of devotion, address that energy of devotion to the part of the man you want to help grow.  By consciously directing your energy, you can help another person along his (or her) path of evolution.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Every man you meet contains multitudes of archetypal characters within him – Boy, Warrior, Bully, Weakling, Prince, King, Rogue, Sinner, Saint, Magician, Trickster, Caveman.  The way you interact with him and direct your energy at him has a large effect on the kind of man you end up dealing with.  In essence, people rise to our expectations of them.  Most of the time, this happens unconsciously.  Here, I'm asking you to bring your unconscious expectations of men to conscious attention so you can direct your energy in a way to bring the greatest fulfillment to your life – and theirs, too.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The foolproof internal guide for your actions</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              There are so many ways to behave in response to men.  How to know when you’re doing the right thing?  Should I call him back?  How soon?  Should I show more interest?  Less?  Instead of going through every possible scenario that can come up, I am now going to give you a foolproof tool for testing any action you could take to see whether or not it's the right way to go.  It’s called <span class="italic">running it through your own neurology</span>.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              For example, let's say you’re wondering whether you should send him a particular email. Send it to yourself first, read it a few hours later and see how it makes you feel.  Generally, if you run a particular scenario through your own neurology and it feels in any way needy, boring, or desperate, it probably is.  You’re better off doing something else or nothing at all.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_18"><span class="bold">When you’re unsure of what course of action to take, do an internal check by running it through your own neurology.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Incidentally, this is the basis of compassion: being able to put yourself in someone else's shoes.  It's a useful skill.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">What drives men away</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              For the past few years, I have been receiving stories about men and their dating experiences with women.  Drawing upon that database and some of my own experiences, here are some behaviors that are highly effective in alienating a man.  If you are interested in him in any way, even as just a friend, you want to avoid these behaviors at all cost.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There are at least three good reasons for avoiding these behaviors.  First, if this was someone that you were interested in dating, then he's probably a worthwhile person to keep in your life even if things don't work out romantically.  Also, you never know – somewhere down the road, you two may meet again under different circumstances, and you'll thank yourself for being on good terms with him.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              That was the obvious reason.  The second reason comes up particularly if you took my advice from earlier in the book and only dated men who were networked-in – that is, someone who was connected to your pre-existing social circle in some way.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Consider this: in the marketing world, studies have shown that a satisfied customer will on average tell two other people about his positive experience, while a dissatisfied customer will tell nine.  Similarly, in the social marketplace, a man who's been treated poorly will tell his friends about it.  So whenever you treat a man poorly, there are potential negative repercussions across your social network.  The principle of enlightened self-interest then holds that, in the long term, you're better off treating everyone courteously.</p><p class="calibre_5">              The third reason is subtler.  As we discussed earlier, psychologists have found that humans have an innate drive to avoid <span class="italic">cognitive dissonance</span>.  This means that they have a strong desire to keep their thoughts consistent with their actions.  So when we agree to do a small favor for someone, we back-justify and think, "Well, if I did that for him, it must mean I liked him."  Similarly, if we do something nasty to someone, we tend to back-justify and think, "If I did that to him, it must mean that <span class="italic">I don't</span> like him."  This can be a particularly pernicious feature of the human mind if you're not aware of it.  For example, you could be <span class="italic">really</span> interested in a guy, but completely lose interest in him after you accidentally stand him up, even though he hasn't done anything wrong.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So if you want to get rid of a man for good, these are some excellent tactics.  If you don't want to get rid of him, do yourself a favor and avoid these like avian flu.  Here they are:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Canceling at the last minute, or 'flaking'</span></span>. This is men's #1 pet peeve (according to a poll of 12,000 of my male readers).  If you set up a date with a man and cancel without giving him enough time for him to reschedule – or even worse, if you stand him up – you've wasted his time and his good will.  This is likely to jeopardize your chances with him, especially if he's a Good Guy.  If he's <span class="italic">not</span> bothered by it, chances are that he either has little respect for himself or for you.</p><p class="calibre_5">              As Don Miguel Ruiz said in his <span class="italic">Four Agreements</span>, be impeccable with your word.  The fabric of society is built on trust, and every time you break a promise, you weaken that fabric and shoot yourself in the foot.  Extend to the men you date the same courtesy you would want them to extend to you.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic">How to recover from it:</span> Unexpected things happen on occasion, thwarting even the best intentions – boss calls you in, family emergency comes up, you have a really bad coffee spill on your dress.  So if you end up flaking on someone, take heart – recovery is fairly straightforward.  Issue a sincere apology in as personal a manner as possible.  A phone call is infinitely better than an email or text message.  Then, offer <span class="italic">sincerely</span> (that word again) to make it up to him.  Invite him to a show or a meal, or offer to cook dinner for him.  Humility here is key.  Then he can determine whether the make-up offer is sufficient.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">The five emasculating behaviors.</span></span> Whenever I conduct workshops for men, I do a values elicitation exercise.  I ask a succession of questions to find out the thing that matters most to a man.  Without exception so far, the highest value for a man ends up being <span class="italic">freedom</span>.  Many spiritual teachers have commented on this, and one could say that complete freedom is the goal of the divine masculine.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Therefore it follows that anything that curtails this freedom emasculates the man, threatening to take him away from the divine masculine.  Energy flows where attention goes, so when you give your attention to a certain aspect of a man, you are encouraging that part of him to grow, whether you like it or not.  Some examples:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">1) Overly solicitous attention: When you give a man this kind of attention, you are encouraging the <span class="italic">boy</span> in him to grow, denying his mature masculine.  Unless that is your goal, reserve overwhelming solicitude for children under 12.  Mothering is smothering.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">2) Jealous attention: Questioning a man about his associations questions his warrior spirit and his devotion to you.  Jealousy always has the effect of driving him away from you, which is the opposite of what's it's trying to accomplish.</blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">3) Critical attention: Playfully teasing and challenging a man is great when done in moderation.  Cutting him down is not.       </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">4) Competing:  Competition is a very masculine activity, so when you choose to compete with your man, you are risking destruction of the masculine-feminine polarity between you if you're not careful.  Now it has to be restored somehow.  If he wins, you will feel put down; if you win, he will feel emasculated.  Both those outcomes are terrible, so the safe path is to avoid competing with him entirely. </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_6">5) Correcting: Leave that for after you've started dating seriously.  And even then, there are better and worse ways of doing it which are beyond the scope of this book (once again, I refer you to Gottman).   </blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic">What to do about it:</span> Emasculating behavior towards a man tends to be more of a habit than a one-time event.  And since habits are unconscious, we tend not to be aware of them consciously.  So the first step is to pay attention and notice if you're doing it.  Listen to others (especially friends and other men) who say you're doing it.  Then take steps to eliminate that behavior.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Neediness.</span></span>  Perhaps I should have mentioned this one first, because nothing will make a man run away faster.  Men love it when you want them; they can't <span class="italic">stand</span> it when you act needy.  It's the ultimate infringement on their freedom and they'll avoid it like the plague.  Calling him too often, wanting to see him all the time, clinging to him like Saran wrap, worrying that he doesn't like you and he'll leave – these are the kinds of behavior that <span class="italic">will</span> make him leave.  Fast.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Give him his freedom.</span></span>  Freedom is a man’s most treasured possession.  The more of it you give him, the more he will respect you and, paradoxically, the more he will want to run back to you.  Even if you’re crazy about a guy, resist the temptation to spend every waking moment with him.  As one wise person said it, give him the gift of missing you.  He’ll just want to spend time with you that much more.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Give him your trust.</span></span>  The more you trust a man and allow him to take charge, the more he grows in the masculine.  And if you’re the agent of making him feel two feet taller than he normally does, he’ll just seek out your company that much more.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Give him your bond.</span></span>  Heard of the expression “behind every great man is a great woman”? This is your chance to be that woman.  When you consistently do as you say you will, a man will have deeper and deeper trust in you.  This will make him feel as if he has a partner who really has his back.  As a result, he will be bolder, bigger and stronger in everything that he does.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Give him your praise.</span></span>  It may not seem so, but we guys are actually kind of fragile inside.  And it seems that a lot of scientists are convinced that everything we do is to impress women, from building large monuments to launching wars.  In fact, evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller makes a convincing case that we evolved such outsize brains mostly to enable skills that would impress mates.  </p><p class="calibre_5">So give the poor fellow some acknowledgment to make him feel as if the all the paintings he painted, the buildings he built, the poetry he scribbled and wealth he accumulated has been worthwhile.  Praise him for the little things, for the attention he gives you, for his small victories.  You will allow him to grow into the kind of man who is capable of even bigger victories – and of creating more monuments to you.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Give him your grace.</span></span>  Every boy slips every once in a while or does something naughty.  We know you’re smart, so we know that <span class="italic">you</span> know when we slip.  As long as the slipping is not a regular occurrence, this is your opportunity to open your heart and offer the man redemption.  A man will be eternally grateful for your giving him a second chance – and grow into a much bigger man as a result of your demonstration of faith.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The importance of closure</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Ever gone on a date that went reasonably well and have a guy not call you afterwards?  Or give your number to a man you found interesting, and not hear from him at all?  Or worse, gather all your courage to give him a call, then not hear back?  Sucks, doesn't it.  Well then you shouldn't be doing that to guys either, because they feel the same way.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Just because of the way the numbers work, you're going to encounter a lot more men that you won't end up dating than those that you will.  This means that you'll be turning down a lot of guys.  I can't emphasize enough the importance to <span class="italic">do so graciously</span>.  You don't need to explain yourself, but you do owe it to the guy to communicate clearly that you're moving on.  Even a brief email or text message is infinitely better than blowing him off and not responding to him at all.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Men find women's lack of responsiveness psychologically distressing.  Because when you don't respond, you're effectively saying that he's not even worth a measly little message saying 'go away'.  It also puts them in a state of limbo, since they don't have any information to go on.  Is she not interested, playing hard to get or just busy?  About as fun as a poke in the eye.</p><p class="calibre_5">              There's a reason to give a man closure that goes beyond etiquette and respect, and that's enlightened self-interest.  As we said before, if the man in question is networked-in, that means you'll have friends in common.  Rudeness to him could reverberate through your social circle, damage your sterling reputation and make it more difficult to get dates with other good men.  It also jeopardizes your potential friendship – why burn bridges?</p><p class="calibre_5">              Another bit of enlightened self-interest: if your goal is to signal lack of interest, your withdrawal of communication initially <span class="italic">whets</span> his appetite instead of dulling it.  This is the opposite of what you're trying to accomplish, so just give the 'no thanks' to him straight.  It's the courteous <span class="italic">and</span> smart thing to do.</p><p class="calibre_5">              That’s all well and good, you say, but what do I actually tell him?  What are the exact words?  Here’s a formula to follow:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">1) Start with praise and appreciation.  “Hey Jim, you’re a great guy and I’m really glad we met.”</p><p class="calibre_5">2) State very clearly what’s on your mind so there’s no doubt. Again, lead with the positive: “We seem to get along (or: ‘I enjoyed our time together’ if it’s after a date), but I don’t think we’re a great <span class="italic">romantic</span> match for each other.” </p><p class="calibre_5">3) Re-state your appreciation, and if you really would like to stay friends with him, give him the option to do so.  If not, don’t: “I’d value your friendship, so if you’d like to stay friends, I’d appreciate that.  If not, I understand, and all the best to you.” For extra bonus points, close with more praise: “I’m sure there’s a girl out there who’d be very lucky to find a guy like you.” </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              The effect that an artfully gentle turn-down like this has on a man is that he gets to feel good about himself and harbor no hard feelings – and <span class="italic">you</span> get to look like a superstar.  Additionally, it’s easier for you to communicate this information because now it’s not as difficult a conversation as before.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_18"><span class="bold">When you decide to move on, always give the man the courtesy of closure.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_2"><span class="bold"> </span></p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Some completely obvious guidelines for date etiquette</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              We hold these truths to be so self-evident that clearly none of you need to be told about them.  The <span class="italic">really</span> obvious ones I'm not even going to elaborate on:  Be punctual.  Show up.  Return his communication in a timely manner.  Don't get sloppy drunk.  </p><p class="calibre_5">The following are worth mentioning because even though they're still obvious, they're useful to keep in mind.  So for the sake of completeness, here they are:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Honor the interaction by turning your phone off.</span></span>  You've made plans to meet.  You have cleared your schedule to make the meeting possible.  So it only makes sense for both of you to honor the time and energy you have put into making the meeting happen.  This means that you will do your best to minimize distractions and focus your attention on him.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Unless you have young children, chances are there's nothing requiring your immediate attention while you're out on a date.  And if you do expect odd phone calls, do your best to minimize them beforehand.  Every time you pick up the phone during a date with a man, you are essentially saying that this other thing is more important than he is.  If that's what you intend to convey, no problem.  If not, keep the phone off.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's a story that illustrates that.  Dan was on a first date with a lovely young lady named Brigitte.  It was a beautiful summer evening in Boston's Botanical Gardens, and they were getting along very well.  One moment, as they were holding hands, their eyes locked, and they drew closer together, face to face.  Right then Brigitte's phone rang.  For a moment, they both froze, as Dan said to himself, "Please please <span class="italic">please</span> don't answer it." That's when Brigitte reached into her handbag, whipped out the phone, looked at the caller ID and said, "It's my mom," and proceeded to talk to her for a few minutes.  Dan waited for Brigitte's conversation to conclude, said, "I have to go now," and left right then and there.  He never called Brigitte again.  As Dan put it, "There is no bigger buzzkill than going for that first kiss with a woman – and her mom calls and she picks it up."  Don't pull a Brigitte.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Stay focused on your companion.</span></span>  There will always be distractions in the environment where you meet with a man.  Do your best to stay focused on your date in spite of those distractions.  Not only is a wandering attention inconsiderate, but it also disrupts the rhythm and flow of a date, especially if the date's going well.  A good rule of thumb is that something that keeps you from interacting with your date for more than 10 minutes is best avoided entirely.  Some examples of these distractions: shops; TV screens; other people, especially friends you bump into or other men you could appear to be flirting with; uncomfortable footwear; and visiting the ladies' room.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Let him speak uninterrupted.</span></span>  When your date is speaking, let him speak.  Once he's done, he will stop and signal that it's your turn.  While he's talking, resist the temptation to chime in with your helpful comments, witticisms, or even empathy ("Oh my god, that happened to me last week, too").  If he's started a story, let him finish it, no matter how long-winded it seems – especially if <span class="italic">you</span> asked him to tell the story.   </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Allow yourself to be led.</span></span>  I wrote this book specifically with career women in mind.  So you are probably used to directing things, managing things, fixing things and generally getting stuff done.  You have mastered some principles of masculine energy, and more power to you for that.  What I'm asking you to do is to tone down that masculine energy when you're on a date and allow your feminine energies to flourish some.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There are many good reasons for this.  First, as we touched on before, a man is most likely interested in you not because of how good a man facsimile you are but rather because you are a woman, the very source of feminine energy and the complement to his masculine energy.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Second, it allows you to assess accurately the man's suitability as a potential partner.  This is your chance to let go and allow someone to take care of you for a change, so embrace that opportunity.  And it's his chance to showcase his ability to take care of you.  The more you allow him to take over and put on his show, the more useful data you are getting on him.  Does he open the car door for you?  Does he take your hand as you were crossing the street?  Does he offer to pay for dinner?  Does he offer his arm as you were walking in the park?  </p><p class="calibre_5">              These may seem like small things, but they tend to be accurate indicators of a man's trustworthiness and leadership ability.  If he doesn't do these things, he may not be the right man for you.  And if you walk in front of him when crossing a street or offer to pay your share of dinner, you are denying yourself this very useful information.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Now both you and I know that you're perfectly capable of crossing a street on your own and paying your own way.  That is not the point.  The point is that human courtship is a dance.  And as in ballroom dancing, it's the man's job to lead.  The point of dancing is not to get anywhere – it is to dance together.  And for the partnership to have a chance of success, you must allow yourself to be led.  If you feel that you could do a better job of leading the dance, you may be with the wrong partner.  It's also possible that you need to relax, let go of the reins, and just for a moment, surrender to the idea of letting him lead.  Just see where it takes you.  It could be a lot of fun.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Getting physical and the art of tantalizing</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Let's be frank: a big reason why you bother dating at all is to find someone you can get intimate with physically.  Touching, massage, cuddling, rolling around naked with someone and having sex are all great fun.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Now because of your privileged position as the woman, you are usually the gatekeeper and pacesetter when it comes to physical intimacy.  And it doesn't take much to get a guy physically intimate with you: a hair flip accompanied by a smile usually suffices.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              As we described, most men are ready to capitalize on a sexual opportunity when it presents itself, so there's not a lot of art involved in getting a man to kiss you, or even to get him in bed.  All you have to do is ask.  The art is getting what <span class="italic">you</span> want, <span class="italic">with whom</span> you want, on <span class="italic">your</span> terms.                </p><p class="calibre_5">              So first we need to figure out what you're on the market for: a roll in the hay, a fling, or a boyfriend.  Then adjust the method depending on your desired outcome.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              The method is blissfully simple, and you know it already.  It's called <span class="italic">teasing</span>.  This means giving the man a little of what he wants, then withdrawing.  It's the physical manifestation of one overarching idea which could be the subtitle for this book: <span class="italic">always leave him wanting more</span>.  This is so important that I'm going to say it again: always leave him wanting more.  And I'm going to put it in a box like this:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Always leave him wanting more.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              I believe I've made myself clear here.  Of course, men are going to string me up by the privates for telling you this, but it's true: men secretly love to be teased (or tantalized, to use a word with a more positive connotation).  Yes, sometimes we get exasperated with it, but deep down inside, we wouldn't want it any other way.  Especially a smart, well-to-do Good Guy will welcome the challenge of dealing with a woman who has the self-control and savvy to be a master tantalizer.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Now I can just hear some of you saying, "No!  I refuse to play such silly games.  I'm not going to torment men, especially the ones I like."  Well, alright, fine.  However, as we discussed already, if you're dating, you're playing a game whether you like it or not.  There are rules – albeit fuzzy, unwritten ones – moving towards an outcome, so you're already involved in a game by definition.  I just want you to play it well so you enjoy the process and get something positive out of it.  And nobody's asking you to torture anyone.  We're just asking you to demonstrate a little bit of self-discipline.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              As much as I wish I didn't have to recommend this course of action, it's just so much better than the alternative.  Tantalizing is the opposite of giving a man all you've got all at once on the first request.  That's just giving away the store and relinquishing all your power and leverage in the dating process.   It's the difference between burning up the fuel in your car's tank little by little, versus setting the whole thing on fire at once.  The former method is likely to get you more mileage. </p><p class="calibre_5">              Again, moderation is key, since it's easy to overdo the tantalizing.  You withdraw the favor from the man just long enough to <span class="italic">whet</span> his appetite, not obliterate it.  Tantalizing is an implicit promise of future fulfillment, so if you delay the fulfillment too much or don't intend to deliver any at all, you may end up being resented as a Tease (bad thing) versus celebrated as a Tantalizer (good thing).  Once again, the middle path of the Tao is best.  Do it without overdoing it.</p><p class="calibre_5">              There are scientific reasons why this works.  When you give a man a little bit of what he wants, you're creating a positive stimulus.  This gives him a little dose of feel-good neurotransmitters.  While he awaits the next stimulus, he's building <span class="italic">response potential</span> – basically, a damming-up of neurotransmitters waiting to release.  Anticipation creates response potential, but only up to a point, after which it decays back to normal (often causing resentment in the process).  So you don't want to delay too much, remembering that <span class="italic">gratification</span>, not delay, is still the key ingredient in delayed gratification.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Now, when you deliver the next timely stimulus, he gets a <span class="italic">bigger</span> jolt of neurotransmitters than he did the first time.  So you're really doing him a favor by tantalizing him, since he gets to have <span class="italic">more</span> fun than he would have otherwise had.  Moreover, when you give too much positive stimulus too soon, you risk blunting his response (through a phenomenon called <span class="italic">habituation</span>), which we'll discuss more in the next chapter.  Do you feel better about the whole tantalizing thing now?</p><p class="calibre_5">              When it comes to getting physical, the man will usually take the lead, so you tantalize by granting or denying permission to his advances.  Feel free to take the physical lead on occasion yourself.  The rule is simple: you may only take a step forward after you've taken one step back.  Depending on how fast you want things to progress, you can go two steps forward, one step back; three steps forward, one step back; four forward, three back – whatever suits your fancy.  Test it out for yourself and find out what works best for you.</p><p class="calibre_5">              As a woman, I have no doubt that you're already a master at this.  But <span class="italic">just</span> in case this all sounds too abstract, here are some simple examples to clarify the whole step-forward, step-back protocol:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Massage his arm, then his shoulders; then go back to the arm before getting to the neck.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Kiss him on the neck, then on the cheek, then go back to the neck before getting anywhere close to his lips.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">• Touch him on the chest, then the belly, then go back to the chest before venturing any further south. <span class="bold">  </span></p><p class="calibre_5">              </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">So you want a second date</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              A frequent question I get from my female readers is "How do I get the second date?"  My answer: wrong question!  You, the pursued party as decreed by nature, the embodiment of the divine feminine, the wellspring of infinite compassion, source of more devotion than he's ever received, should never have to worry about that.  And if you've been putting into practice what we've discussed so far, <span class="italic">he</span> will be the one begging to see you again.  Your job is to draw him out and evaluate whether he's a Good Guy – and a potential match for you.  You are the evaluator.  You are the picky buyer.  You are in the driver's seat.</p><p class="calibre_5">              That said, I still want to make sure that you get the second date, so <span class="italic">leave him wanting more</span> (ah, that again).  Remember the legend of Scheherazade in the <span class="italic">1001 Arabian Nights</span>?  She would tell a story to the bloodthirsty King Shahryar each night and cut it off right at the cliffhanger, leaving the king in such a state of suspense that he had to grant her a day's reprieve from execution to hear the rest of the story the next day.  For you it's not your life on the line, but it is something fairly important: your fulfillment.  So play your hand well and be the cliffhanger.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Whenever I give you an idea, I also like to give concrete examples of how to use it, so here are some suggestions:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Leave open conversational loops.</span></span> Wow, I just thought of something incredibly important to tell you, but I'll have to share it with you later.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              What did I just do?  I opened a conversation topic – without quite finishing it.  That's an open loop.  The unconscious mind of your listener will crave closure and want to hear the rest.  For example, you'd say, "That reminds me of a trip I took with my sister to Carnaval in Brazil – it was <span class="italic">sooo</span> much fun... but we can get back to that later."  Missing information is mystery, and mystery increases your attractiveness.  So open some loops with the promise of closing them later – and your King Shahryar (minus bloodthirsty intent) will want to come back for more.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Leave open physical loops.</span></span>  If you give good hand massages and you massage both his hands, you close the loop.  If you just massage one hand, he will wonder when the next hand gets the attention, and you'll have an open loop.  If you kiss him good-night on the cheek but not on the lips, you're creating an open loop.  Next time, if you kiss him on the lips but keep your mouth closed, you're creating another open loop.  You get the idea: leave him wanting more.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              You're overdoing it when you're sabotaging your own fun purely for the sake of form.  If you're dying for a torrid makeout session with the man of your dreams and you know you're not going to see him until you come back from your monthlong business trip, by all means go for it.  You can be savvy without turning into a nun.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Hint at future shared activities.</span></span>  When you find out things you have in common, describe what it would be like to do it together: "Oh my god, we should definitely go do a salsa class together!  I really enjoy dancing, and love it when a man leads well on the dance floor."  Now he's imagined himself having a good time dancing with you, holding you in his arms and twirling you around, and if it doesn't happen, it's a <span class="italic">perceived loss</span> for him.  People are much more motivated to prevent loss than they are to go for gain, so he's now more likely to want to see you again.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Give him a chance to shine.</span></span>  Did he say he could beat you at air hockey?  That he makes a mean lasagna?  Bring it on, you say – on the next date.  You're giving him a chance to show you how cool he is (guys love that) <span class="italic">and</span> ensuring yourself a subsequent meeting, you crafty woman.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              What you don't want to do too often is to issue the man a challenge.  That's one of the emasculating behaviors we just covered.  Challenging is a function of the <span class="italic">masculine</span> – the kind of thing his guy buddies are for.  If you challenge him, you risk compromising the yin-yang polarity.  In the meantime, you <span class="italic">are</span> craftily setting up an opportunity to make him look good.  When he looks good, he feels good, he attributes that good feeling to you, and he will want to see you again.  And even if you're the world air-hockey champion, when you let him win (by the smallest of margins, of course), you both win in the long term.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;

border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              So I would imagine that if the <span class="italic">Tao Te Ching</span> were to answer the 'when' question we posed at the beginning of this section, the answer would be simple, succinct, and come mostly from within you.  It may even sound like this: <span class="italic">you should only have sex when you really want to.</span></p><p class="calibre_5">               Assuming that you're clear with your own motivations and that you've done your homework and picked a Good Guy, that guideline should suffice.  It may sound simplistic, but consider this.  There are people out there having sex when they <span class="italic">don't</span> want to.  And there are plenty of people <span class="italic">not</span> having sex when they really want to.  Those policies aren't necessarily aligned with your fulfillment.</p><p class="calibre_5">              Notice also that the 'when you really want to' policy exists in the <span class="italic">now</span>.  We're all for foresight, but you simply don't have access to the future – all we have is the present.  Also, dwelling on the past and the way things unfolded the last time and the time before isn't going to be helpful either.  It's you, your guy, your desire, and your best judgment <span class="italic">right now</span>.  So quit overthinking it already.</p><p class="calibre_5">              It's also free of any notions of guilt, shame, and opinions of third parties.  The ancient Taoist masters thought of sex as sacred communion between two consenting adults.  Practiced properly, it is a path to improved health, longevity, and spiritual development.  This simple, straightforward formulation, plus the absence of the concept of sin in Taoist thought, is in contrast to the complications that certain religious traditions heap upon sexual intimacy.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Whatever religion you were raised in and however old you are today, it's never too soon to relinquish all those extra complications that get in the way of your fulfillment.  Let's face it: sex is fun, and you enjoy it.  A lot.  And there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  In fact, it means you're a healthy, vivacious woman with the forces of nature coursing freely through your veins.  Amen to that.</p><p class="calibre_5">              At the same time, sexual energy is a powerful force.  To ensure that it's a source of fulfillment in your life, it's important to use it judiciously.  It's a bit like a tiger: let loose untamed, it can cause damage; tamed, it can serve you.  That's why we're saying <span class="italic">when you really want to</span> as opposed to <span class="italic">whenever you want to</span>.  That's the difference between the tiger tamed and the tiger let loose, a constructive force and a potentially destructive one.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              So let go of all the arbitrary labels.  Sex isn't right or wrong or dirty or clean – it simply is.  You're not a slut if you've slept with several men (whatever several means to you).  And you're not a prude if you take your time to get physically intimate with someone.  You're just you.  Suspend judgment, and see things simply as they are.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Balancing desire and empowerment</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              It's no news to you that sex is a major motivator of men in their pursuit of women.  So if you were to offer it up too early, you stand to lose some leverage in the relationship.  However, if you're really good at sex, you will probably <span class="italic">gain</span> leverage once you start sleeping together, since he'll be coming back for more.  So the more skilled you are sexually, the earlier you can afford to initiate sexual relations with a man without losing leverage.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              I've mentioned the word <span class="italic">leverage</span> a few times here, so let me make something clear: sex is, above all, a shared experience of joy, not a business transaction.  The joy is tarnished when it's used as a bargaining chip or a tool to manipulate and control.  At the same time, I do want you to be aware of how initiating sexual activity relates to your empowerment and long-term fulfillment in a relationship.  Awareness is good.</p><p class="calibre_5">              If there's a downside to jumping into things too early, there's also a downside to delaying too much – namely, loss of your own fulfillment.  Allow me to illustrate with an example.  Let's say you bought yourself a nice slice of chocolate cake, and you're saving it for a time to really enjoy it.  You think about it at work, imagining how delightful it would be to go home and, after a long day of work, treat yourself to this luscious dessert.</p><p class="calibre_5">              You get home, open the refrigerator door, look at the slice of cake, and think, "Well, if I have it <span class="italic">tomorrow</span>, it'll be even better, because I'll want it that much more."  So you wait another day.  And perhaps another day.  On the third day, when you finally take out the chocolate cake, you notice a little white spot on it – it's started to spoil, and it's no longer good to eat.  You ruefully throw the cake in the trash, and with it, the promise of fulfillment.  The middle path of the Tao here is balancing your own fulfillment with your leverage in the relationship so you get to eat your cake while remaining empowered.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Also keep in mind that you gain some very valuable pieces of information after having sex with a man.  First is whether he's really after you or just wants sex.  If the former, then he'll usually be <span class="italic">more</span> interested <span class="italic">after</span> sleeping with you.  If he was just looking for another notch on his bedpost, his interest will wane.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Second, you get to find out if you're sexually compatible with each other.  It's best to find that out sooner rather than later.  A prolonged and intense non-physical romance can lead to a lot of frustration if you find out late in the game that you're really not right for each other sexually, which is the topic of the next section.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The importance of sexual compatibility</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              We discussed this briefly in Chapter 10 on the three-chakra connection, and it is important enough to bear repetition.  If you aim to have a long-term relationship with a man, it's paramount that you be sexually compatible to one another.  This is the story of the impending divorce or breakup I've heard a thousand times: "Oh, he's so great on paper, and we have everything in common, and he's just the sweetest guy, and I know I <span class="italic">should</span> be hot for him, but there's just no sexual chemistry."  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There is no such thing as <span class="italic">should</span> be hot for him, sister – you either are or you're not.  And it's called chemistry because it has everything to do with chemicals in your body and your genetic design.  Without getting too much into the science here, there are deep-seated reasons why nature determines whether two people are sexually compatible that bear upon the health of their potential offspring.  For example, nature has built-in systems for making siblings sexually unattractive to each other, since their kids could potentially come out with three heads and five limbs.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              This is the Tao operating at its most basic, so heed its call.  If you're sexually incompatible with a guy, there's probably a very good reason for it.  So no matter how wonderful he is otherwise, it's a non-starter.  Find your long-term mate elsewhere.  </p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">Men's secret fears about sex</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              Here's a little secret for you: men feel just as much confusion, guilt and shame around sex as you do.  Most men you meet probably grew up under some religious tradition with myriad restrictions and prohibitions on sexual behavior.  On some level, they probably think sex is dirty.  Moreover, the decent, smart, educated guys you'll be dealing with are often afraid of being sexually aggressive.  Between their sensitivity, respect for women, and fear of being accused of sexual harassment (or worse), they're scared little puppies deep down inside.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              What an extraordinary opportunity for you!  Because if you choose to be the one woman who can make sex feel like a guilt-free, shame-free, fun, liberating, shared experience for him, he will love you <span class="italic">forever</span>.  There's the old cliché about men wanting a woman who's both the Madonna and the whore.  You can toss that one out the window and replace it with what men really want (but may not know it yet): the goddess of love, all-nurturing, all-embracing, all beautiful all the time (refer back to Chapter 2, 'Who You Really Are').  </p><p class="calibre_5">              Guys are scared.  Yet at the same time they're supposed to be in charge of moving things forward, so it's really important for you to give them green lights so they know when it's okay to proceed.  Otherwise, he may just get stuck between his two competing imperatives of 'stop' and 'go'.  Verbal and non-verbal feedback are great, so if you're enjoying yourself and you want more – let him know!  Make the green lights clear and unmistakable in their meaning, e.g. "Touch me there"; "More, please"; touching him; taking his hand or head and putting it where you want it to be.  In fact, this is important enough to deserve its own box:</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><blockquote class="calibre_16"><span class="bold">Clearly communicate to him when it's okay to proceed physically.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5">              Remember again that if you've set things up the right way so far, this is the area you have to worry about the least.  When you feel connected with a man and it feels right, it will all flow.  At that point, you will not need any rule book; trust yourself and flow with the Tao.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><p class="calibre_5"><span class="bold">The importance of sexual know-how</span></p><p class="calibre_5">              One of the absolute best, most useful and productive things you can do in this lifetime is to educate yourself about sexuality.  As a woman, you're basically designed to be a pleasure machine, so the better you get to know the machine, the more fun you'll have.  It's free, it's safe, it's healthy, and it empowers you tons.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              On top of that, sex is a pathway to higher consciousness and ecstatic communion.  The Eastern sages have worked for millennia to figure out how to get the most out of it.  Sadly, in spite of the abundance of information available on sexuality, most people remain undereducated on the subject.  That is why we’ll soon offer the booklet <span class="italic">The Tao of Sexual Ecstasy</span> as an introduction to Eastern and Western practices for enriching your sex life.  So now, not only do you have my full permission to get really good at this, you no longer have an excuse not to.  </p><p class="calibre_5">              There's a difference between skill and experience.  To use an analogy, you can play tennis with a lot of people, but unless you get some proper instruction, there's no guarantee that you'll be any good.  On the other hand, you can gain a lot of skill from a little bit of instruction, putting you head and shoulders above others who may have had more partners.  So don't feel as if you need to sleep with a bunch of men to gain sexual skill.  And if you've already slept with a bunch of men, don't feel as if that means you can't stand to learn more.  Be open to the idea of real development in this area of your life.  Anything worth doing is worth doing exceptionally well, especially when it's this much fun.</p><p class="calibre1" style="margin:0pt;
