By taking into account our motivations, our means, and our opportunities, we can decide which dreams we are meant to pursue.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Lunch-Hour Dreams</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Sometimes starting something new is the best decision to get you closer to your closing argument. But other times, what you aspire to do or be can distract you and taunt you with its unattainability. When you consult your dreams, it is imperative that you be honest and aware of their achievability, because this is what will inform how big of a role they play in your life. It is more than okay for something to remain simply a “daydream” so you can stay focused on your day job. No one <a></a>taught me this better than Philip Papadis.</p><p class="calibre_9">Philip Papadis was a classmate of mine through elementary school, junior high, high school, and law school. I knew from the way he was always prepared in class and seemed to do better than I did on the pop quizzes that he was a smart and conscientious person. He was small and slight in stature, and I don’t recall him playing any sports in high school. I don’t even recall him playing church sports, which is where those of us who loved sports but were not good enough to make the high school teams went.</p><p class="calibre_9">After we graduated from law school, Philip and I were roommates for a summer that we spent studying for the bar exam. Three years of law school doesn’t get you much of anything, except the right to take the dreaded bar exam. Back then, the exam was three days of torture. Day one consisted of an everlasting list of multiple-choice questions. Quite candidly, the law does not lend itself very well to multiple-choice (or as I like to call it, multiple-guess) questions. Days two and three were essay questions.</p><p class="calibre_9">Philip studied so much that summer. He put a lot of pressure on himself, as if the weight of more than just his career rose and fell with the outcome of the exam. He left nothing to chance as it related to his preparation for the bar exam. He had a routine. He was early to rise to study for the essay exam questions. He would take a break for lunch and then spend the afternoon taking practice multiple-choice exams. In the evening he scanned the television in our rented house on <a></a>Wheat Street in Columbia, looking for the Chicago Cubs. I can still see him crouched down in front of the television, catcher’s mitt on one hand, gently hitting his other hand into the mitt as if he were waiting to receive the pitch from the pitcher on television. He was twenty-five years old but was enjoying himself like a child living out some dream.</p><p class="calibre_9">I had a different routine. I was in a fantasy baseball league with some of my friends from law school. We would meet before the season and have a “draft” of all available Major League Baseball players. Each team was judged and scored based on batting average, home runs, steals, and runs batted in. Pitchers were judged and scored based on earned run average, wins, strikeouts, saves, and “whips,” which are walks plus hits divided by innings pitched. But that was about as much math as these law students were capable of doing. There were trades and waiver wires on top of the daily exhaustive review of the box scores in the newspaper.</p><p class="calibre_9">Trust me when I tell you managing a fantasy baseball team requires a tremendous investment of time and energy. My parents always taught me, “If you are going to do something, you should do it to the very best of your abilities,” and “Anything worth doing is worth doing right,” along with a host of other platitudes that essentially meant the same thing. I certainly did not want to disappoint my parents by giving short shrift to my responsibilities with the fantasy baseball team, so consequently and regrettably, I was not able to spend very <a></a>much time studying for the bar exam, taking practice exams, or doing anything other than checking box scores and scouring the waiver wire. That was my routine.</p><p class="calibre_9">Philip and I had very different priorities, but our respective routines would collide once a day. Every lunchtime, without fail, when Philip would break from his studies, he would come to wake me up. (I was still asleep because my parents also stressed the importance of getting sufficient rest!) And when Philip would come into my bedroom, it was always the same colloquy:</p><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3">Philip:</span> “Hey, Trey, are you up yet?”</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3">Trey:</span> “Umm, no, Philip, I am not up. It’s barely noon. Who is up at this hour? And by the way, when you get to the evidence portion of the bar exam material, you will find a section on circumstantial evidence. An example of circumstantial evidence might be that when someone is in a dark room, with their eyes closed, lying down in bed, they are asleep!”</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3">Philip:</span> “Oh, okay, well when you get up, let’s go down to the school and play catch.”</blockquote><p class="calibre_9">So, I would get up, put on my tennis shoes, grab my glove, and then walk down the street to a nearby playground at a middle school to pitch to Philip.</p><p class="calibre_9">It was always his dream to be a Major League Baseball <a></a>catcher. It did not matter that Philip didn’t even make our high school baseball team. It didn’t matter that Philip was about the size of a sixth grader fifteen years after he finished the sixth grade. Both of us knew he was never going to be a baseball player at any level. But it was his dream, and it was harmless and innocent. For me, it was just a walk down memory lane to the old ball fields at Hillbrook Park in Spartanburg, a daily opportunity to connect to my boyhood. For Philip, it was more than that. It was a present dream, a present fantasy for just a small part of the day. For about an hour, reality would be suspended and his dream would rise, and then it was time for him to take more bar exam practice tests.</p><p class="calibre_9">Philip’s dream of being a Major League Baseball catcher is one of the most vivid memories I have of that summer of misery preparing for a three-day exam. The sound of that baseball popping into his glove and the sight of him crouched down in the den of a rented house waiting to receive the pitch from a pitcher on television. That’s what I think of when I think of Philip. I think of the power dreams have over us—the power of dreams to suspend reality, even if it’s for just a few moments during the day.</p><p class="calibre_9">And that’s about all I can do now—think wistfully of those old days with that undersized catcher. Philip died suddenly, unexpectedly, at the age of forty-five. It is with a mixture of joy and sadness that I reflect on Philip and his baseball dream. It was never going to happen, and the logical part of me says, “Why waste the time?” Then again, it actually did happen. <a></a>Maybe not the way others may have drawn it up, but his dream came true every single day that summer over the lunch hour, at least in his mind. And maybe that is all that matters. I do not know what comes after this life. But if there is a heaven, I hope Philip is there. And I especially hope he found someone to play catch with.</p><p class="calibre_9">At the end of that summer in 1989, Philip passed the bar exam, and so did I. He went on to become an attorney, staying with the career choice he decided on in college. He raised a family and was able to provide for them. He was good at what he did, even if it was never what he dreamed of doing most. The power of dreams is that they give us a reason to hope, even against all mathematical possibilities.</p><p class="calibre_9">An outsider might look at Philip’s story and say he didn’t follow his dreams. In my judgment, that person would be wrong. He did not wholeheartedly pursue his dream of becoming an MLB catcher because the probabilities were so low, bordering on nonexistent. He knew that. But he did keep that dream quietly alive while pursuing other dreams much more in the realm of possibility.</p><p class="calibre_9">I used to lament those who seemed to lack the self-awareness to know that what they aspired to and dreamed of was never going to happen. The chances of becoming a world-famous actor or actress are incredibly small, no matter how many parts you get in your local theater. The chances of becoming a professional athlete are infinitesimally slight no matter how many times you are the first person selected for the kickball <a></a>team during recess in elementary school. But I don’t lament people’s openness about their wildest dreams anymore. Nurturing dreams is important, no matter how irrational they are, so long as they remain free and innocent and only occupy the hour during lunch.</p><p class="calibre_9">There is a difference between those lunch-hour dreams, largely unobtainable and out of reach, and goals that are challenging but still within your grasp. Self-awareness helps you understand the difference and apportion your time accordingly.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Means, Motive, and Opportunity</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">If you have ever watched any crime show, you have probably heard the phrase “means, motive, and opportunity.” These are three aspects of a crime that must be, or should be, defined, explained, and proven for the jury to reach a verdict. These are also the factors that can help us measure the attainability of our dreams and make self-aware decisions. Ideally, our decisions will not involve crimes, but the consequences are still high nonetheless. By looking at each category and answering a few key corresponding questions about yourself, you will be able to identify dreams you should confidently pursue.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Means</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">What are your talents and abilities? What are you good at? What means do you have to accomplish your goal?</p><p class="calibre_9">Each of us is born with natural dispositions and talents as part of our genetic code. And then we choose whether to nurture those talents over the course of our lives. We can also develop skills in areas in which we might be lacking natural talent. Knowing your means—the capabilities you have and the ones you can develop—will help you find success, whereas not knowing your means will likely end in embarrassment or worse.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Motives</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">What drives you? What are you passionate about? What is the fuel behind your dreams and aspirations? What do you want to accomplish?</p><p class="calibre_9">What motivates you can be identified by thinking about how you’ve advanced so far in life. Think about times when you were excited to complete a task. What gave you the energy and drive to do so?</p><p class="calibre_9">It’s important to identify both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Intrinsic motivation is when you do something because it is inherently interesting and enjoyable. My wife likes doing word puzzles. I do not understand it. Just write the word correctly and stop making me guess what word the letters <span class="italic">e, o, g, n, m</span> spell.</p><p class="calibre_9">She liked the challenge of unscrambling letters and doing some version of Wordle long before there ever was a Wordle. For years we subscribed to the local newspaper simply because she enjoyed doing the morning puzzles. I found that to be a <a></a>very expensive reason to subscribe to a newspaper, but I dared not say a word because it brought her joy. Most days, I had no idea whether she got the word or not, although seeing her sit at the kitchen table for hours with a perplexed look on her face and a pencil in her hand was some circumstantial evidence she had not quite figured out the word “gnome.” There was no prize at the end, no public acknowledgment of her skill and perseverance. She is modest so it’s not like she paraded around the house singing the national anthem to herself in some made-up medal ceremony. She simply enjoyed it, for herself, by herself.</p><p class="calibre_9">Extrinsic motivation is when you do something because it leads to a separable outcome.<sup class="calibre6"><small id="filepos247389" class="calibre7"><a href="#filepos260758"><span class="calibre8"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">[*]</span></span></span></a></small></sup> I will often go to the golf course late in the afternoon and have a match against myself. I enjoy golf, yes, but my primary motivation is to get better so that I can beat my friends the next time we play together. My motivation is extrinsic in that I am desiring a specific and external outcome: bragging rights.</p><p class="calibre_9">Often, our intrinsic and extrinsic motivations overlap, but it’s important to identify both, and do so separately, so we can clearly understand the why behind our decisions.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Opportunity</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">What are the opportunities currently available to you? Do <a></a>you have free time, or is your schedule full? Are you capable of creating either the time or the opportunities to pursue something worthwhile and new?</p><p class="calibre_9">Just like means, opportunities can arise naturally, or they can be sought and developed. But it takes wisdom to know when to pursue opportunities, when to make opportunities, and when to let a closed door remain a closed door.</p><hr class="calibre5"/><p class="calibre_3">—</p><p class="calibre_9">There is a verse in the book of Psalms that says to “make a joyful noise unto the Lord.” Whoever wrote that never heard me sing. Some noises are too much, even for God.</p><p class="calibre_9">Even so, my parents thought it was a good idea for me to be in the church choir. I did not think it was a good idea chiefly because choir practice was on Sunday afternoons, and that was one of the seven afternoons I had set aside each week for sports. But I was not yet in that season of life where I made my own decisions, and I was summarily overruled. If I was going to be forced—against my will—to be part of a church choir, I figured, I should at least have a leading role, right?</p><p class="calibre_9">The church choir was holding auditions for a musical. When it was my turn to audition, I sat beside Mr. Ronald Wells, the minister of music, on a piano bench in the choir room of our church. He played a note on the piano and asked me to sing that note, and so I did. Or at least I tried to. This is what I remember most vividly: He reached his arm as far away from that piano key as he physically could while still <a></a>being on the same piano, and, playing another key, he said, “No, Trey, you sang this. I played this,” striking the original key. We tried it again. The result did not change. He needed the wingspan of a wandering albatross to reach what I did versus what I was supposed to do. He did not specifically say that the sound I made while attempting to sing did not occur anywhere else in the world, but that’s only because he was a minister, and they’re supposed to be nice. I am sure he thought it.</p><p class="calibre_9">I went home and told my folks that I had tried out for a role and was not optimistic about my chances. They responded that I needed to “practice” my singing, as if a singing voice could be acquired with sufficient effort and desire. I did practice. I practiced a lot. Neighbors began moving away. My sisters began calling the cops. Glass began breaking. It was awful. The more I tried, the worse it got. It did not matter how much I <span class="italic">wanted</span> to be a good singer; it was <span class="italic">never</span> going to happen. Yes, I know people advise us never to use the word “never,” but that word was actually invented to capture the probabilities of me ever becoming a good singer.</p><p class="calibre_9">It is hard to be cut from a volunteer church choir. But that’s what almost happened. I almost undid two thousand years of Christian teaching with my audition for a singing role in a church choir.</p><p class="calibre_9">The sad, unmistakable reality is that I cannot sing. I wish I could. I would give every penny I have to be Bono’s backup singer, but wanting to be good at something and being good <a></a>at something are two different things. I had the motivation, but I had neither the means, thanks to God, nor the opportunity, thanks to Mr. Wells. I may want my closing argument to include that I was a good singer, but there is no evidence to support that closing argument. There are numerous witnesses, Ronald Wells being the first, who would not corroborate my claim of being a good singer.</p><p class="calibre_9">Now, my wife, on the other hand, has the opposite issue. She is remarkably talented. She can sing and play the piano and the harp. She can read music and understands the difference between pitch and tone, melody and harmony. When she’s forced to sing in public, her talent makes everyone wonder why she doesn’t sing more often. When she was in high school, she went on that very same church choir tour I auditioned for and, despite her modesty, was essentially forced to be the lead singer.</p><p class="calibre_9">Soon after we were married, she would be asked to sing by local groups, clubs, or churches in our area. Immediately after she accepted the invitations (because she cannot say no to people), a change would occur within her. She was full of dread, angst, and anxiety, which would only get worse as the singing date drew closer. She would get as nervous as Lindsey Graham in a spelling bee. Why? Because she does not like to sing in public! It’s just that simple. She is great at something she does not enjoy. She has the means and plenty of opportunities, but no motivation or desire.</p><p class="calibre_9">So, what does it look like for means, motive, and <a></a>opportunity to align? What are those moments when what you want to do matches up perfectly with what you are made to do? I’ve seen and experienced this numerous times in my life. And there was one time when I almost messed it up for someone else.</p><p class="calibre_9">I remember interviewing lots of young women and men when I was the circuit solicitor in South Carolina. One interview, and the result thereof, stands out more than all the rest. We had an opening for a domestic violence prosecutor in magistrate’s court. Domestic violence cases are challenging for myriad reasons, and the magistrate’s court is considered a lower court than the state general sessions court. It’s an important court, but the perception was that this was an entry-level prosecutor job—and a very difficult one at that. So it was a challenge to recruit and retain prosecutors for that position.</p><p class="calibre_9">Cindy L. Smith applied, and my top deputy solicitor, Barry J. Barnette, and I were interviewing her for the position. Cindy was very nice, but she struck me as painfully shy. When I say “shy,” I mean her email address included the names of her two cats! It seemed to me that she used her cats’ names as her email address because she did not like talking to humans. And it is very hard to be a prosecutor if you don’t like talking to people.</p><p class="calibre_9">During the interview, her passion for helping victims of domestic violence was evident. I recall telling my deputy solicitor after we interviewed Cindy, “She won’t ever be a great <a></a>prosecutor, but she does have a heart for domestic violence victims, and sometimes desire is more important than talent.” We gave her a chance. We put her in magistrate’s court prosecuting first-time interpersonal violence offenders, and I put it out of my mind. <span class="italic">Hopefully she will survive, get along with the domestic violence investigators, work well with the folks at the Safe Homes/Rape Crisis Center, but that’s about it.</span> Or so I thought.</p><p class="calibre_9">And then the calls started coming in. First, it was cops calling me to ask if I’d gone downstairs to watch the new prosecutor in court. And then it was the judges who called. “Have you had a chance to see your new prosecutor in action?” And then the call that undoubtedly piqued my curiosity: “Gowdy, have you seen Cindy Smith in a jury trial? She’s better than you are.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Cindy went from “shy” interviewee to a top prosecutor, trying the most significant cases in our office, oftentimes right alongside me. She was fantastic. Part of it was a natural ability that I frankly had incorrectly assessed when she interviewed. But most of it was that she made herself into one of the better courtroom lawyers I had ever seen. She took what she loved, and she decided to become great at it. Once we hired her, she had the opportunity, the means, and the motivation to do what she was arguably born to do.</p><p class="calibre_9">Often, the three elements do not align. You have the motivation, but not the means or the opportunity. You have the means and the opportunity, but not the motivation needed to <a></a>propel you forward. But if and when all three align, that is when you are clearly on your path toward your closing argument; that is when the case begins proving itself.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Aligning Ability and Desire</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Crafting the self-awareness to assess our means, motivations, and opportunities takes time, trial and error, and maybe a few embarrassing auditions. But once we start an honest and open dialogue with ourselves, we will more clearly see where we are now and what we need to do to get to where we want to be. Sometimes that means becoming better at what we are passionate about. Sometimes that means creating opportunities where none exist. Sometimes that means accepting that you will never be Bono’s backup singer because you cannot even entertain a captive prison audience in need of visitors on a church choir tour. Sometimes that means staying exactly where you are and investing in what you already have.</p><p class="calibre_9">I can safely tell you based on my own experience that if you do not like conflict, you will likely not enjoy politics—not currently, at least. If you like contrast but not conflict, you might make it as a trial lawyer. If you like small children but not teenagers, you should not teach junior high school. These things are simple and obvious, but I am struck by how few people spend any amount of time honestly interviewing themselves about both their abilities and their interests and <a></a>how the two align—especially when it comes to vocation.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">Here are a few questions to answer for your audition:</span></p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">What do you consider your gifts and talents?</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Do you enjoy what you are good at or can you come to enjoy it?</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">How do you assess whether you are good at something?</blockquote></li><li value="4" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Do you love some line of work or vocation? Are you currently good at it, or can you become good at it with work, training, and opportunity?</blockquote></li><li value="5" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Does it matter to you whether you enjoy what you do for a living?</blockquote></li><li value="6" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">How much time are you willing and able to devote to the dreams that aren’t in the realm of possibility? Can you pursue that dream during your lunch hour like Philip?</blockquote></li></ul><p class="calibre_9">Once you know what you are good at and what you like, you can measure the attainability of your goals and apportion the time you deem appropriate to every dream. It did not take me long to figure out that I would never be a singer. One failed audition and I was done. It’s okay if what you really <a></a>long for never comes true. Many of the things we dream for or about do not come true, and yet they are still worth pursuing, in proportion.</p><p class="calibre_9">“Don’t quit your day job” is a phrase often used to criticize someone for a poor performance or attempt at something. I don’t want my central advice here to come off with the same tone, so I’ll say it a little differently: Find your lunch-hour dreams. Don’t be afraid to explore and fail and audition, because that is how we find out what we are truly capable of.</p><p class="calibre_7"><a href="index_split_013.html#filepos261356"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">SKIP NOTES</span></span></span></a></p><blockquote id="filepos260758" class="calibre_5"><a href="#filepos247389"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">*</span></span></span></a><span class="calibre3"> Richard M.
