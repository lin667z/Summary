</blockquote></blockquote><a></a></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_8"><span class="calibre2">Checks and Balances</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_15"><span class="calibre1">When you are considering starting something new and pursuing a goal, dream, or aspiration, there will inevitably be a lot of fear and other emotions that come up. While I am a big proponent of logic-centered decision making, I have learned to appreciate the value that our intuition and emotions play in our lives. It took me a while, but I’ve come to see that fact and feelings go hand in hand, and both are now a vital part of my decision-making process.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Three Branches of Decision Making</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">I am of the opinion that everyone has a natural bent toward making decisions with their head (logic), their heart (emotions), or their gut (intuition). All three play a very important role in our lives, and none should be minimized to the point of having no power. Just like our three branches of government, they provide checks and balances, and they are best when they co-exist with some friendly, constructive friction.</p><p class="calibre_9">Our logic sometimes fails to take into account our emotional well-being or what we instinctually feel is the right choice. Our gut instincts alone may result in rash decisions not guided by logic or empathy and not tempered by the wisdom of time. And our feelings are often unreliable narrators. They need to be balanced by the voices of logic and intuition.</p><p class="calibre_9">As we consider starting a new venture, logic should be driving the car, our intuition can be in the passenger seat and help with navigation, and our emotions can sit in one of the captain seats and be in control of the music. If you let either intuition or emotion take the wheel, you will more often than not find yourself lost or at a dead end. Logic keeps us on course to the final destination, but it in no way should be the only factor considered in decision making. That would make for a lonely road trip—and a lonely life.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Navigating Fear</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Not always, but often, our intuition takes the form of fear. I have lived with fear for as long as I can remember. Fear is an exacting opponent. It never sleeps, and it’s always whispering something. Fear used to drive my life, but I’ve managed, slowly over the course of time, to make it a passenger. I choose to let it ride with me in the form of intuition, but I never let it drive the car. Not anymore, at least.</p><p class="calibre_9">First, I had a fear of being abandoned by my parents. I have no idea why I feared that. My parents were great, loving, <a></a>protective people. They would never abandon me. My fear was irrational, but that did not make it any less real or debilitating. We had a Kmart in our hometown, and our family of six would periodically make the trek there. I had no interest in following my mom and three sisters to the girls’ clothing section, so I would peel off with my dad when we entered the store. Sometimes I would have trouble keeping up. I would lose sight of him and, rather than stay put, knowing full well my father had not left me, I would panic. I would go to the front of the store, find the store manager, and have them blast out on the intercom system, “Would the parents of Trey Gowdy please come to the front of the store?” Then the poor manager of Kmart and I would stand there waiting for my parents to come get me. My mom would come running. My father would come walking. This happened more than I care to admit.</p><p class="calibre_9">To this day I have irrational fears. I can laugh at myself for harboring them, but they are no less real. I don’t need my mother to go to Kmart with me anymore. My present fear is that I will actually have to go to a store—any store, not just a Kmart—and run into someone who wants to talk about politics.</p><p class="calibre_9">I also cannot stay at home by myself at night. Terri rarely goes on trips without me, but when she does, I have a friend come stay at our house, I go stay with a friend, or—I am embarrassed to admit—I check myself in to a hotel. I’ve done that plenty of times. It makes literally no sense. But I just <a></a>cannot stay at home by myself at night.</p><p class="calibre_9">I can analyze it all I want. I can reason with myself. I can get home security systems and every other means of personal protection you can conjure. But I still can’t stay in my home at night by my lonesome without a five-foot, four-inch, small-framed, first-grade schoolteacher, who sometimes forgets to lock the doors. By the way, Terri thinks it’s because I watch so many British crime dramas at night, but that couldn’t possibly be it, could it?</p><p class="calibre_9">Professionally speaking, my fear has always been the same: a perceived lack of preparedness in me by others. This is worse than just a general lack of preparedness. That we can control. My fear is that others will <span class="italic">perceive</span> me as being unprepared, and the perception of others is often out of our control. I spent more time than I would ever want to admit anticipating what the other side (be it in the courtroom or congressional hearing room) would argue or come up with. Of course I wanted to do a good job—that’s why we prepare. But my great fear was that others would <span class="italic">perceive</span> me as not having anticipated an argument or being caught flat-footed and lacking the imagination to have foreseen an argument.</p><p class="calibre_9">What role does fear play in your life? What are you particularly afraid of, and how does that impact your decision making? Can you turn fear into an ally while also concocting an antidote to its debilitating form? Therein lies the key: Use your fears as much as they use you. When you are aware of your fears and can voice them, you can begin to find the good <a></a>in them.</p><p class="calibre_9">Fear makes us pause; that can be good.</p><p class="calibre_9">Fear makes us cautious; that can be very good.</p><p class="calibre_9">Fear keeps us from doing things we instinctively are uncertain about. That can be helpful when we try something new or different or tinged with risk.</p><p class="calibre_9">When fear is riding with us and not driving us, we can listen to its argument but ultimately be in control of the situation. We can distinguish the rationality and irrationality of fear’s direction. Fear doesn’t have to be a weakness if you use it as a way of understanding the weight, consequences, and risks of a decision. To do that turns fear into a valuable ally that then transforms into intuition. When you can tame fear, you can live alongside it.</p><p class="calibre_9">If you cannot tame fear, it will become a dictator in what is meant to be a democracy among your head, heart, and gut. And if we aren’t careful, it will pen our closing argument for us—and because fear has such a strong voice, it will write the narrative for our lives centered around itself.</p><p class="calibre_9">I’ve mentioned the fear of failure, the fear of being abandoned, and the fear of violent crime. But fear manifests itself in many forms. Fear of rejection keeps us from meeting other people or taking opportunities that could change the trajectory of our lives. Fear of being embarrassed or being thought of as unintelligent keeps us from sharing innovative thoughts and ideas that could revolutionize or shift the way people think. Fear of losing people keeps us from developing deep <a></a>relationships.</p><p class="calibre_9">If fear is left untamed, we will begin seeing it etched into the various building blocks of our lives, building a prison, decision by decision, instead of a path to that desired final destination. Interview your fear. Argue with it. Cross-examine it. Dictate the terms to your fear so it can frame your decisions but not derail them. When you envision the closing arguments of your life and that final picture, make sure fear is not in the receiving line.</p><p class="calibre_9">How do we make sure our gut, intuition, and fear responses aren’t driving the car? We bring in the checks and balances of logic and emotion. To effectively balance fear, we need to focus on the numbers (logic), and we need to focus on others (emotion).</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">1. Focus on the probabilities over the possibilities.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When I was younger and my older sister was overcome with fear about something, we would sit down and assess the likelihood of her worst fears coming true. In one particular case, she was about to head off to an outdoor summer camp, and she had just finished reading a book about the notorious serial killer Ted Bundy. She was afraid that he would escape from prison and come to her church camp. We sat in her room and separated the possibilities from the probabilities. We applied reason through numbers and came up with a worst-case-scenario plan, then accepted that we weren’t ever going to need that plan. (By the way, a pretty good plan <a></a>would include not reading books about serial killers right before you are going to an outdoor camp in some remote part of North Carolina, but I think she learned that lesson.)</p><p class="calibre_9">It’s important to consider all possible outcomes of our decisions, but we shouldn’t live our lives in fear of the one percent. We should not live our lives in fear of Ted Bundy coming to our church camp, or losing our job after one simple mistake, or moving to a new city and not making any friends. Through confronting your fears with logic and numbers, you learn to defuse the fear with the facts.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">2. Focus on others through compassion and understanding.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">We can also fight fear by focusing on other people. We are often most courageous—most able to overcome our fears—when we choose to defend someone or something we care about.</p><p class="calibre_9">My wife laughs at the fact that I can stay alone if literally anyone else is in the house—even an infant—but cannot stay if it’s just me. It doesn’t make sense to her that my fear of being alone would be eliminated by someone so young that they could do nothing in the event of a catastrophe. So I’ve done what I encourage you to do and interviewed that particular fear, and what I found was that having someone, anyone, present is enough to get me to stop focusing on every noise I hear and instead focus on whoever else is with me and possibly in need of protection. The thought of defending others against an intruder chases that particular fear away.</p><p class="calibre_9">I’ve observed this phenomenon in other people as well. For <a></a>instance, my wife’s response to the pandemic was vastly different from mine. She would wake up each morning and pray for her first-grade students, who she was no longer able to see on a daily basis. Then she sat at the kitchen table, watching the phone and waiting for her students or their parents to call and ask for help. She checked in with my parents and others to see if there was anything she could do for them, and then she wrote notes and cards to people in the community to offer some bit of happiness and hope in the midst of something no one had ever gone through before. She would maybe sit down for a minute at night and watch the Hallmark Channel. I’m sure she wanted to know what was going on as much as the rest of us but, more than receiving knowledge, she wanted to give, to help others.</p><p class="calibre_9">My wife isn’t fearful because she is always focused on other people. She forgets to lock the door, she doesn’t know the alarm code for our house, she couldn’t find a gun if you paid her a finder’s fee, and then she wouldn’t know how to use it if she did find it. She spends her time thinking about others and doing for others, so that doesn’t leave a lot of room for thoughts of fear. The only two things I know she’s afraid of are bugs and that our local cable provider will drop the Hallmark Channel. Other than that, she is one of the most courageous people you will ever meet. She’s tiny, and she won’t ever win a physical fight, but she wins the war against the most powerful opponents of all: fear, darkness, and negativity.</p><p class="calibre_9">My wife’s response during the pandemic helped me <a></a>understand the different ways to evaluate and respond to fear. While I was reading morbidity and mortality graphs, she was helping people. While I was assiduously surveying every conceivable symptom of the coronavirus, she was writing cards. I needed to change my mindset and think outwardly. In the process, my definition of family began to change. It now includes neighbors to whom I used to only wave early in the morning or late in the day; it now includes doctors and nurses who I will never meet; truck drivers, grocery store workers, police officers, and people who deliver food. And when I think about my “family,” I become more courageous and less fearful.</p><hr class="calibre5"/><p class="calibre_3">—</p><p class="calibre_9">When fears arise about starting something new, focus on the numbers, the percentages, the probabilities, and then focus on others. Fear is natural and doesn’t indicate that you need to abandon your new endeavor; it simply means you have a navigator who is looking out for you. As long as you don’t surrender the wheel to your fear, and you keep it in its place by way of logic and compassion, it can be a trusted companion you can consult as you make decisions in your life.</p><p class="calibre_9">And then there is hope. I live in a state whose motto is “While I breathe, I hope.” It was on the state seal above the judge’s bench in every courtroom I ever appeared in, and yet I never fully appreciated it until 2020, as the world watched and waited to see the full effect of an airborne virus on life as <a></a>we knew it. When you are young and healthy, you do not dwell on breathing or hoping much. You have the two greatest gifts of all: youth and time. But they both fade. And then you wake up and realize two-thirds of life is in the rearview mirror. Or you realize that something as simple and essential as breathing is not guaranteed.</p><p class="calibre_9">All of this helped refocus my attention on that state motto, to reflect on the people who first brought that motto to life for me years before. It was the crime victims and their families that first made that motto real to me, especially the homicide victims. We have the gift of life and that alone should provide some measure of hope, particularly because there are others who, through accident, disease, or criminal act, are no longer with us. Being alive truly is a reason to hope.</p><p class="calibre_9">The motto of our state dovetails with the verse you hear at almost every wedding: “And these three things remain: faith, hope, and love.” We should love our neighbors and define the word “neighbor” as broadly as we can; we should have faith that the future will be brighter; and we should enlist hope to help us turn the enemy of fear into a useful companion who helps us navigate our life journey forward.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Punctuation of Emotion</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When starting something new, you will cycle through myriad emotions. Whether you have a job interview lined up or you’re about to ask out the person you like or you have your <a></a>first intramural softball game, you will have nerves and excitement in varying degrees. You will likely feel anxious, hesitant, and uncertain. You will also feel happy, hopeful, and inspired. Which emotions should you listen to? And how much should you take them into consideration?</p><p class="calibre_9">The crime of manslaughter is the killing of another person in the sudden heat of passion. Manslaughter is the law’s acknowledgment that killing someone because an irrational impulse arose within you should be considered differently from killing someone after having thought the act through. There is no other mitigation of murder except this “sudden heat of passion.” There is no allowance for killing in the “sudden heat of <span class="italic">thought</span>” or the “sudden heat of <span class="italic">logic.</span>” But the law does recognize that emotions can overrule and override your otherwise rational thoughts.</p><p class="calibre_9">So, if your emotions are capable of overriding your thought processes such that they can lead you to do something criminal, surely those same emotions can cause you to do other unwise and regretful things. Surely they can cause you to start (or end) a new relationship or quit your job against better judgment. That is the overwhelming power of emotions—sometimes they wreck your best judgment. Something that powerful must be tamed.</p><p class="calibre_9">When possible, let emotions be the by-product of a good decision rather than the driver of decision making. We should look to our emotions to warn, amplify, confirm, delay, and ratify what our minds tell us. They can punctuate, not dictate, <a></a>your decisions. Rather than letting them be the judge, we should call them to the stand as witnesses. I recently heard a football coach say, “We need to play with emotion, rather than allow our emotions to play with us.” That can work, too.</p><p class="calibre_9">Emotions contain important information, and in our quest to make the best decisions, we need to collect all the information we can. Your emotions enable you to be more self-aware, empathetic, and perceptive—all of which are crucial to a successful and significant life. Acknowledge them. Then cross-examine the information your emotions give you, and recognize any contradictions or fallacies that arise from their “testimony.”</p><p class="calibre_9">There have been many times when I let my emotions be the judge of my decisions. The older we get, ideally, the more we recognize the fallibility of our emotions and keep them from overriding logic in the decisions we make. I use the word “ideally” because I still stumble from time to time.</p><p class="calibre_9">As a frequent traveler, I pride myself on never choosing connecting flights. I like direct flights. But one weekend when my wife and I were going to a wedding in Kentucky, I slipped up when planning our flight. We were flying to Kentucky and, rather than drive an hour to the Charlotte airport in North Carolina, I booked a flight out of Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, thirty minutes closer to our house, which connected in Charlotte and then took us on to Louisville, Kentucky—and the reverse on the return. We made it there fine. The wedding was great, and then the next <a></a>day, we hopped on our flight from Louisville to Charlotte. We were literally seated on the plane in Charlotte about to back away from the gate and head toward Greenville-Spartanburg when the announcement came over the intercom system: “We need everyone to deplane while maintenance checks something. We do not anticipate a long delay and will notify you when it is time to reboard the plane.” To think I was so close to taking off and being back in South Carolina with some daylight left to practice my putting, and it all came crashing down because I was on a plane in Charlotte.</p><p class="calibre_9">“Maintenance” and “deplane” were really the only words I needed to hear. I told my wife we would gather all of our belongings, leave the terminal, and Uber our way back to the South Carolina airport to get our car.</p><p class="calibre_9">“Don’t you want to wait and see how long the delay is first, honey?”</p><p class="calibre_9">“No, ma’am, I do not.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“It could be just a few minutes, and we would wind up getting home earlier. Plus, we would save the money for an Uber driver.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“No, ma’am, I do not.”</p><p class="calibre_9">That was all I could say because it was all I could feel. It was like a catatonic chant: “No, ma’am, I do not.” I did not want to wait one second longer, because I was both impatient and unhappy with myself for making such a rookie mistake, a connecting flight. So we took an Uber from one airport to another airport—for the most part in silence because my wife <a></a>was not happy with my not-so-wise decision. I saw her on her phone a lot and wondered what she was doing. Turned out, she was checking the flight to measure my decision against facts, logic, and numbers. <span class="italic">Well, that isn’t fair,</span> I thought to myself. It’s not fair to use logic to evaluate a decision I made based purely on impulse and impatience. She kindly (sort of) let me know the flight I could not wait for had, in fact, already taken off and would, in fact, beat our Uber driver to where we were going.</p><p class="calibre_9">“Are you happy? The plane you could not wait for has already been fixed and taken off.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“Yes, I am happy, as a matter of fact. I am out a lot of money. I opted for a far less safe mode of travel. And I am going to get there even later than I would have had I listened to my beautiful wife. But amazingly, I am happy.”</p><p class="calibre_9">In this instance, I let my emotions have the final say. Had I first collected information from my emotions, I would have learned some valuable information:</p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">I was really just angry at myself for booking a connecting flight.</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">I was wondering why so few people were on board with my idea of Monday weddings, having already sacrificed a Saturday.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">I wanted to be moving. I didn’t like being still because it made me feel powerless and restless. Let’s be honest: We all know people like that. They value movement more than direction. They would rather drive around hoping something “jogged” their memory than stop for a second and consult a map or pull up a navigation app.</blockquote></li><a></a></ul><p class="calibre_9">Had I cross-examined my feelings, I would have uncovered that:</p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">While I was angry at myself that I had booked a connecting flight, there was nothing I could do about it at that point. All I could do was learn my lesson and be extra careful in the future not to book a connecting flight.</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">While I felt like my weekend was being taken away from me, I didn’t have anywhere I needed to be. There was no emergency calling me home, only my golf clubs and the putting green, and both would be there the next day and the next and the next.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">While moving would make me feel better, it would in all likelihood not get me home any sooner than staying put and waiting out the delay. It was just movement, not direction.</blockquote></li></ul><p class="calibre_9">Had I let my emotions—irritation, impatience, restlessness—be my witness rather than the judge of the decision to find a new mode of transportation, I would have seen the <a></a>inconsistencies and fallacies in their testimony and listened to my beautiful wife. In hindsight I should have stayed in the terminal, sat by my wife, and mumbled a lot while they fixed the plane.</p><p class="calibre_9">The subtle message of my airport fiasco is this: Movement isn’t always purposeful or constructive. Yes, I “started” something new with my Uber ride. We were moving. We were changing. But while the movement may have assuaged my boredom, it was not the wisest decision.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you are starting something new, your emotions will add liveliness and color to your decision. Your enthusiasm as you decide to start a new job will be a witness to the suitability of your decision. Your uncertainty about taking the next step in your relationship may warn you of problems you’ve been ignoring. The boredom that you feel when you are home alone may confirm your intention to go out and start new friendships. The sadness you feel after finishing school might delay your decision about what to do next. Listen to your emotions; they contain important information to help you navigate every decision in your life based on your whole person. When you consult your intuition and emotions as you approach decisions logically, then you will have more information to build out your road map fully as you start something new.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_8"></div>
