Knowing when to leave can only be determined by honestly assessing both your current situation and who you want to become in the next season of your life.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">At What Price</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">In 2009, toward the end of my time as circuit solicitor, the job of prosecuting crimes in state court for a decade had begun to take a toll. Not a physical toll—the job is not physically taxing—and not an emotional toll—sadness and sorrow are part of life. What I felt would be best described as a spiritual toll.</p><p class="calibre_9">Prosecuting violent crime cases one after the other, seeing images of all manner of abuse and depravity and evil, exacted a heavy price. The repeated exposure to the worst elements of humankind was negatively affecting what was left of my soul. <a></a>There are very few happy endings in the criminal justice system. And “closure” is usually a word uttered by those who haven’t buried a loved one or survived a personal trauma.</p><p class="calibre_9">I encountered preachers from time to time in the state criminal justice system, usually as defendants or in court on behalf of a defendant. Rarely did I see “ministers” there on behalf of a victim. I remember one particularly heinous case, which involved not only the sexual assault of a child but also the random murder of a woman who had no connection with the defendant at all. This crime combined the worst of human nature into one single person—the ability to hurt, in a horrific way, the most vulnerable among us and then the ability to take the life of a stranger because it was convenient.</p><p class="calibre_9">But that did not keep folks from the defendant’s “church” from coming to court to “support” him. A pedophile who kills a young mother had half the courtroom full of supporters. The victims’ side of the courtroom was empty. That did not and does not sit well with me.</p><p class="calibre_9">And yet I loved the challenges of the courtroom and piecing together a prosecution. I felt the most professionally alive when giving voice to the abused, injured, and dead. There was purpose and meaning in doing it. I was doing for others what they quite literally could not do for themselves, and I was helping those who survived pursue justice and accountability. I think I did a good job for the victims and their families and friends. I know how hard I tried to.</p><p class="calibre_9">But loving something and being good at something are not <a></a>always enough. Sometimes even a job you love and derive satisfaction from comes at too steep a cumulative cost for you or those you care the most about.</p><p class="calibre_9">Some jobs, no matter how rewarding, have a shelf life. It does not mean you were wrong to decide to start. It just means you have to know when it’s time to leave.</p><hr class="calibre5"/><p class="calibre_3">—</p><p class="calibre_9">The challenge of being a domestic or interpersonal violence prosecutor is invariably that someone hurts or kills a person they claimed to “love.”</p><p class="calibre_9">The challenge of being a child abuse or child sex abuse prosecutor is at least twofold: (1) There is the loss of innocence you experience when the most vulnerable are hurt, terrorized, and abused; and (2) your mind begins to perceive threats to your own children where rationally they do not exist.</p><p class="calibre_9">The challenge of being a homicide prosecutor is you are always dealing with death—and it is often the kind of death we fear the most, the kind where the front door of our lives is kicked in, without a moment’s notice, no time to say goodbye, no time to make amends, no time to utter a petition. Whatever was the last thing you said to those you care the most about will have to suffice for all of time. The kind of death where your last vision is filled with malice, not love. And those who loved you know that your end was terrifying and hate-filled.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you prosecute homicide cases, it is that terror-filled <a></a>death that you find front and center in nearly every file that touches your desk. The best prosecutors force themselves to experience what the victim experienced and what those who loved the victim are currently experiencing. To be an effective “voice for the voiceless,” you have to know what they would say and how they would say it. To speak “truth to power,” you must be able to relate to weakness. To be effective at prosecuting murder cases, you have to be able to take the jury to the crime scene, to the final act of malice, and essentially re-create that scene as if it were occurring now. To do that well requires thinking about it, dwelling on it, perhaps even obsessing about certain aspects of a case, and reliving it in your mind for months before court.</p><p class="calibre_9">As a result, you find yourself dwelling on the fact that a person could inflict so much violence on another person, oftentimes a victim the perpetrators claimed to care very deeply about. There is just so little “hope” or “optimism” in criminal court generally and in homicide cases specifically. The better you are at being a violent crime prosecutor, the less hope and optimism you will have. People talk from time to time about “leaving their work at the office” or “not taking the job home with you.” I was never good at that. I never wanted to be good at that.</p><p class="calibre_9">I prosecuted a man for killing an older couple in a quiet little community in Spartanburg not far from where my children went to elementary school. The assailant broke into their home while the couple was sleeping side by side in their bed. <a></a>Stop right there and let that sink in. Don’t merely read the words; create the image. Try to put yourself in the position of that couple, as a prosecutor would. You are in the sanctuary of your own home, asleep in your own bed, beside the person you love the most. You are in the quiet season of life, having already worked and sacrificed and raised your family. You have done absolutely nothing to provoke anyone to do anything to you. You have been good. You have been kind. You have even been kind to the very person who is standing over your bed as you sleep, with a hammer in his hand. You gave him a ride to the grocery store when he needed one. You paid for his groceries when he had squandered his money on drugs and alcohol. You treated him with respect when you saw him in the yard or the driveway. And all of that goodness resulted in nothing more than a drug-addled man in your home standing over your bed armed with a hammer.</p><p class="calibre_9">One image from the hundreds of photographs taken at that particular crime scene is forever etched in my memory. The image is of the husband’s broken, battered body lying on the bed with his arm extended toward his wife. A husband reaching out—even in death—trying to touch and protect the person he loves the very most in life. Love was trying to show itself in the midst of carnage.</p><p class="calibre_9">The Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 13:13, “And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.” Maybe so, in some places, but love wound up losing its battle with hate and depravity in that bedroom that night.</p><p class="calibre_9">Multiply that crime scene by hundreds. Add in the murder of children. Add in the random, inexplicable murders committed by a stranger against a stranger. Gratuitous, mindless killing. Day after day after day. You want to be a violent crime prosecutor? That is what it’s like. And if you want to be good at it, you have to feel it yourself as deeply as you can.</p><p class="calibre_9">When Sundays rolled around, I would be sitting in church with my wife and our children hearing about the love of God, how God is in control of everything, how God can use all things for good, and whatever other platitudes are usually offered by those who have not been the victim of murder or rape or child sexual assault. The message I was hearing was not lining up with those crime scene photographs.</p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">If God is as powerful as you say He is, surely He could have stopped this. Surely He could have found another way to accomplish whatever purpose needed to be accomplished. I mean, He’s God after all, right? He can do whatever He wants to do. He can intervene when He wants to intervene. And yet time after time after time, for reasons I cannot ascertain, He elects not to do so.</span></p><p class="calibre_9">I was increasingly unable to reconcile what I was seeing and living at work with the faith I had grown up with. I asked God to give me a better understanding. I talked to friends whose opinions I valued. But I could not then—or even now—understand having the power to prevent acts of unmitigated depravity against innocents and not exercising that power.</p><p class="calibre_9">There was a quote I used to keep under the glass on my <a></a>desk at the Circuit Solicitor’s office. This quote has been attributed to different people, but my best research indicates it was likely uttered by a philosopher named Solon and chronicled by Plutarch. Solon was asked, “What city is best to live in?” He responded, “That city in which those who are not wronged, no less than those who are wronged, exert themselves to punish the wrongdoer.”<sup class="calibre6"><small id="filepos306017" class="calibre7"><a href="#filepos329080"><span class="calibre8"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">[*]</span></span></span></a></small></sup> I chose a paraphrase that simply said this: “Justice will be achieved when those who are not injured feel as indignant as those who are.” I liked that quote because there was something quasi-spiritual in it, and this was a spirituality I could actually relate to.</p><p class="calibre_9">If we are to treat others as we would like to be treated, then should we not also feel what others feel who have been mistreated? Can you put yourself in the stead of the person wronged? To do that in homicide cases is impossible. You cannot know what it is like to be dead, and to dwell on that is destructive, and yet you must if you want to be the most effective advocate, the best prosecutor for those victims who actually lived what you fear the most.</p><p class="calibre_9">Nonetheless, the decision to leave the job as circuit solicitor was not an easy decision to make because I was realizing my dream to prosecute crimes that victimized people. At this point in my career, I had experience and I had confidence in my ability to do a good job. In many ways, I was in the exact <a></a>place I had felt called to be in for so long. And yet, living this dream was adversely affecting other important areas of my life. The dream was exacting too steep a price.</p><p class="calibre_9">When that happens to you, leaving is something you must begin to consider.</p><p class="calibre_9">Sacrifices are inevitable; you sacrifice going to some parties or football games to make better grades; you sacrifice sleep to go to the gym, or your favorite food for a better result on the scale; you sacrifice watching a show you love on TV to put in a few extra hours of work at night. You rightfully sacrifice momentary desires for a better future outcome all the time.</p><p class="calibre_9">But when you begin to consistently sacrifice important parts of your being to realize a goal, and the future looks like more of the same with scant prospect for a reprieve, it may be time to leave. There will come a time in your life when the sacrifices are no longer worth what you once longed for. There are questions you can ask yourself to determine whether this is where you are in your own life:</p><ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Is the job, relationship, educational experience, or overall situation consistently taking more from you than it’s giving you?</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Is your well-being, whether physical, spiritual, or emotional, adversely impacted by staying where you are?</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Are the people closest to you being negatively affected by your decision to stay where you are?</blockquote></li><li value="4" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Are there ebbs and flows to your sacrifice, or is it seemingly constant?</blockquote></li><a></a><li value="5" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Has anyone of value or significance in your life raised concern for your health in relation to what you are currently doing?</blockquote></li></ol><p class="calibre_9">When we decide to leave is usually when a ghost may show up, a ghost that can play a friendly or unfriendly role in our decision making. For me it was this dreadful sense that I was abandoning my dream job before it was completed. I was also haunted by the thought that I was abandoning the victims who currently or in the future would need a good advocate. So I rationalized by telling myself things like “Anything worth doing requires some sacrifice” or “Of course it’s hard, but it’s worth it at the end” or “This is just a rough patch, but it will get better.” And I began to rethink or doubt my decision to leave.</p><p class="calibre_9">The question then became: Can I reconcile peace of mind with doubt, or navigate the penumbra that exists between the two? Peace is some acceptance, some reconciliation that the decision has indeed been made and is final. Peace can be logic straining to be heard through the allure of what used to be your dream or goal. Constructive doubt makes you prove your case. It forces you to really be sure this is the right decision. Destructive doubt keeps hinting that you are making a mistake but never gives you a different or better option.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Retiring Dreams</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When you are at a crossroads trying to determine whether to leave, part of your hesitation may be due to the fact that what you are doing now was once your greatest aspiration. That was certainly true for me as I was considering leaving my position as circuit solicitor. Stepping away often means leaving a dream behind. It can be tantamount to the end of an era or the death of a desire that once kept you feeling alive. It can even feel like a self-betrayal, turning away from something you once claimed to hold dear.</p><p class="calibre_9">At this moment of decision, you need to make certain you are the keeper of your dreams rather than the other way around. Your goals and aspirations should be liberating, not debilitating. Your dreams should not be full of dread and angst. They should make you better, not more cynical.</p><p class="calibre_9">One of two things happens with our dreams when we make healthy decisions: They evolve with us, or we retire them for our betterment. If you allow them to become chains, you will suffer under the weight of them.</p><p class="calibre_9">Dreams transition and transform as we move through the seasons of life. I encourage you not to keep them on pedestals, pristine and polished. They are part of you; don’t think them divine and untouchable. Other parts of you change, so why not your dreams too? Take them down, examine them, take them apart, look at their pieces, perhaps even improve them. You are the author of those dreams; you craft their story arc. <a></a>Write, edit, rewrite; keep tweaking. What you thought was your dream to become a nurse turned out to be a desire to help people in need, and it manifested itself in becoming a therapist. The dream that began as a desire to play golf on the LPGA tour was, at its core, a love of golf, and it evolved into becoming a volunteer coach of a high school golf team. What started as a dream to be a doctor ran into organic chemistry and calculus, and it wound up manifesting itself in becoming a part-time EMT saving lives. It is okay for your dreams to grow and evolve as you do.</p><p class="calibre_9">My dream to prosecute crimes that victimize people was one that I reluctantly but correctly had to consider retiring. The much broader goal behind that—a love of fairness and a desire for a just result—could stay and evolve with me, but it would manifest itself differently in my future. The battles with defense attorneys were over. I would no longer put the pieces of a puzzle together using evidence and persuasion. I would never again feel the challenge and exhilaration of empowering a victim to be heard. All of that would end, but so too would some of the darkness that had clouded my soul.</p><p class="calibre_9">Letting go of a dream can be excruciating. It can feel like failure. But letting go of an old dream is not a failure; it’s a forward movement—progress wrapped in remembrance. And by retiring certain dreams with pride and nostalgia, we can focus more of our energy and time on the new goals that will bring hope into our lives.</p><p class="calibre_9">When we retire a dream, it’s good and healthy to reflect on <a></a>the ways we accomplished it and how it served us well to pursue it for a season. These are not reasons to stay, just good things to remember. Hold the good and acknowledge the not so good as you recognize the shelf life of that particular dream.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Statute of Limitations</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">On Mother’s Day in 2009, after church and during the subsequent celebratory lunch, the two people who can get me to do things no one else can get me to do conspired against me. Terri and my mom had each independently concluded that it was time for me to do something else for a living. Sitting at a table in the restaurant of a country club, I knew there was a golf course right outside the window behind me, but my attention was straight ahead. My mom and Terri both suggested it was time to move on. The price I was paying to be in the criminal justice system was too high.</p><p class="calibre_9">Later, when serving in Congress, I had friends whose spouses were essentially de facto chiefs of staff. But Terri has never entered those decisions uninvited. She trusted me to think it through and arrive at a defensible decision, especially as it related to work. For Pete’s sake, she let me drive to the Atlanta airport to interview for a job in Colorado soon after we were married! She is not a meddler.</p><p class="calibre_9">But this time it was different. She believed it was time for me to leave the courtroom. The job had not simply impacted <a></a>her husband but also our children. Our eight-year-old daughter would drag her pillow into our room at night and lie down on the floor because she overheard some conversation about a “bad person” when I was on the phone with a colleague. Terri was a stickler for children sleeping in their own rooms, but even she relented eventually. Our son is older than our daughter, but even he was just eight years old when I became the circuit solicitor in 2001. He was two years old when I joined the U.S. Attorney’s Office in 1994. Having a father as a prosecutor was really all he knew. From 1994 to 2000, even at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, he would go to work with me on Sunday afternoons. We had a deal. He would ride with me to work in Greenville and I would stop at a drive-in hamburger place called Checkers so he could get his beloved french fries. The years go by, children get older, and there is no doubt that I projected the worst qualities of the people being prosecuted onto broader society, and it no doubt impacted what I was and was not willing to let him do in his youth.</p><p class="calibre_9">I knew Terri was right; it was time to do something different.</p><p class="calibre_9">Being a prosecutor had been part of my identity for so long. It had been my dream ever since I somehow passed the bar exam and worked for that federal judge in Anderson, South Carolina. I found a great sense of purpose and value in my role as both a state and federal prosecutor, so to leave would be more than just getting a different job. It would be assuming a different professional identity altogether. That <a></a>Mother’s Day lunch helped me realize what I’d been avoiding for too long: Work was jeopardizing other priorities and exacting too steep a price for those I cared about the most.</p><p class="calibre_9">While my wife and mom were very helpful in telling me when to leave, they did not offer much by way of advice on what to do next. So now I had to figure out both how to make my exit with grace and what the next chapter of life would be. The questions are separate but inextricably linked: whether to leave, when to leave, how to leave, and what to do next.</p><p class="calibre_9">The first challenge was how to leave a job I was elected to carry out before my term was up. It’s one thing to have that conversation with your mom and your wife; it’s quite another to have it with an entire community. Explaining the reality of where I was in my mind was not a viable option, practically speaking or otherwise. The simple truth was that the job had significantly and adversely impacted my faith. That is a selfish thing to share with others. The spiritual journey or faith of my constituents is none of my business, and my own cynicism should not impact them. There is a verse in the Bible that says: “Work out your salvation with fear and trembling” (Philippians 2:12 NIV). It doesn’t say anything about holding a news conference and lecturing others about reconciling God’s omnipotence with dead children.</p><p class="calibre_9">Moreover, there are scores of women and men who can navigate their work with no discernible impact on their other beliefs. I think of pediatric oncologists, cops, and prosecutors who have seen the same things I’ve seen, perhaps even worse, <a></a>but reached a different conclusion about staying or leaving. I think of special education teachers who may constantly ask God why. I cannot speak to what others go through any more than they could understand the impact my work had on me. And trying to explain it, in my hometown surrounded by people who really do believe “all things work together for good,” did not seem a viable option to me, someone who no longer really believed that to be true.</p><p class="calibre_9">As far as I could tell I only had two options: tough it out for another two years or find an honorable exit, a parachute everyone would understand. And so, after much debate and a search for better alternatives, I decided to run for Congress.</p><p class="calibre_9">My primary reason for running for Congress was not a desire to legislate or a passion to fix the tax code. It was my belief that a run for Congress, successful or not, would be an honorable exit from a difficult job I no longer felt I was able to do. Secondarily, I figured the twin themes of fairness and justice could manifest themselves in a different sector of government.</p><p class="calibre_9">In June 2009, I announced I would be running for Congress and, if successful, would be leaving the Circuit Solicitor’s Office. While I was excited for the challenges of another race and opportunities to learn and participate in the legislative branch, mainly I was happy that I had a good reason to leave. Even now as I think back on that decision to leave prosecution, I know it was the right decision to make, but it was still one of the hardest decisions in my life.</p><p class="calibre_9">What followed turned out to be a long year of campaigning coupled with the voice of doubt relitigating that decision to leave. During the year I ran for Congress, my area of South Carolina was devastated by multiple murders. Was I really leaving at the right time?</p><p class="calibre_9">On June 27, 2009, less than four weeks after I stood in the front yard of my own home and announced a bid for Congress, a peach farmer in neighboring Cherokee County, South Carolina, which was also in my district as a prosecutor, was shot to death in his home.</p><p class="calibre_9">Four days later, on July 1, 2009, an eighty-three-year-old mother and her fifty-year-old daughter were bound and murdered in Cherokee County. The daughter was in town to visit her mother. That was all, a daughter visiting her mother, and they both were murdered.</p><p class="calibre_9">On July 2, 2009, a father took his fifteen-year-old daughter to work with him at a local store. It was clear, at this point, that there was something awful happening in Cherokee County—there was a murderer on the loose killing people indiscriminately in their homes. So, this father made sure his daughter would not be home alone. The hand of fate had this serial killer come into that family-run store and kill the father and shoot the fifteen-year-old girl, who died from her injuries two days later.</p><p class="calibre_9">On July 6, 2009, the police encountered a man they suspected of being that serial killer across the North Carolina state line. A shoot-out ensued, and the police killed the serial <a></a>killer. There would be no trial, no defense attorneys trying to create doubt in the minds of the jury, but there would also be no chance for the families of those forever impacted to know the one thing families all want to know, which is: Why? Why my husband? Why my wife? Why my child?</p><p class="calibre_9">The next day, on July 7, 2009, in Spartanburg County, a man beat and shook a ten-year-old child to death. He was her mother’s boyfriend, a volunteer firefighter and a paramedic. He had previously broken the child’s arm, but this time he took her life.</p><p class="calibre_9">On July 8, 2009, in Spartanburg County, a man put an eight-year-old girl, who was going swimming at a neighborhood pool, in a headlock, placed a gun against her head, and shot and killed her. He shot her four times in the presence of other children. The child was the daughter of a man his estranged wife was seeing. A man shot and killed a child to “get back at” a man who was dating his estranged wife.</p><p class="calibre_9">In twelve days, seven people were murdered, including three children. Twelve days. Seven people lost the only thing that really matters in the final analysis. A wake of agony, pain, and misery for those who loved the victims created a residue of grief that will never abate.</p><p class="calibre_9">For someone struggling to reconcile what he heard on Sunday mornings with what he saw every other day of the week, it was too much. It was too late. If I was leaving to preserve some semblance of understanding as to how all of this works together in the physical and spiritual realms, I was too late.</p><p class="calibre_9">The last case I ever prosecuted was in November 2010. I had won the congressional election, but I had not yet taken the oath of office, so I was still the circuit solicitor. I decided to take on the prosecution of the man who killed Meah Weidner, that ten-year-old girl whose mother’s boyfriend beat and shook her to death. It seemed like the perfect example of why prosecuting was my initial dream and why it was also necessary to leave this dream behind. The boyfriend was convicted. It would be considered a “win” for prosecutors and cops, I guess, if that word can even be used in a homicide prosecution. And yet a ten-year-old girl was still dead. Still killed by a man who claimed to love her mother. Her family left to grieve. So there are no victories. There is only enduring.</p><p class="calibre_9">Tim Scott tells me, from time to time, that I am “cursed with a good memory.” He means it as a compliment. He knows having a good memory is helpful in most facets of life, but it can come at a considerable price.</p><p class="calibre_9">Now that I am more than a decade removed from any courtroom, my beloved hometown of Spartanburg is a memory collage of crime scenes. I love this town and I won’t leave, but there are reminders of old cases everywhere I turn. Heading out of town to Columbia, South Carolina (where our daughter attended college and law school), I pass two murder scenes, including one where a mom was simply unloading groceries from her car when she was kidnapped, carjacked, sexually assaulted, and killed twenty years ago. But I still look <a></a>to the right off the interstate, through a narrow stand of pine trees, at the house every single time I drive that part of the interstate. The grocery store where I shop on Saturdays is where I would sometimes run into her mother, a still grieving mom and grandmother, trying to raise a dead daughter’s son. Driving toward Greenville, I pass multiple crime scenes—including a still unsolved multiple homicide at a bank on the interstate. And immediately I think of the image of three people sitting dead in a small room, their lunch hours transformed from simply cashing a check to being shot execution-style in a bank. It’s been well over a decade, but I still look.</p><p class="calibre_9">Even driving to the mountains of North Carolina recently with my son to play golf, I found myself in a rural and beautiful part of northern Spartanburg County. I should have been admiring the hardwoods and catching glimpses of the mountains rising on the horizon, but I was looking for the little side street where a husband cut his wife’s head off with a sword because she was in the process of leaving him. I was thinking back to the trial and how senseless it all was. She is dead. He is serving life without parole. In every direction there is pain, grief, and death. Many can move on and put the images out of their minds, but those “cursed with a good memory” cannot.</p><p class="calibre_9">Ironically, as I still bump into victims of crime, family members of victims who were killed, and even old, grizzled cops, it is their faith that sustains them the most. It is their <a></a>faith that saw them through their own valley of the shadow of death. The images that cause me to doubt cause them to be renewed in their faith.</p><p class="calibre_9">I wound up not being able to outrun what I was trying to leave. I had, in fact, already lost what I was trying to preserve. I had left the U.S. Attorney’s Office to run for circuit solicitor because I wanted to go to that venue where crimes against people, crimes that shock the conscience of a community, are prosecuted. I wanted to seek justice for those who lost everything, for those who could no longer defend themselves. And I did that. I did what I always wanted to do. But the job exacted a heavy price. It took my peace of mind, it shook my faith, it robbed me of optimism.</p><p class="calibre_9">In the aftermath of decisions that take too much from you, it’s wise to look for an exit, preferably an honorable one. The motivation to protect your well-being, your family, or other important parts of your life and being, is never a wrong motivation. But there is a larger cautionary tale. Be careful what you wish for. You may just get it.</p><p class="calibre_7"><a href="index_split_017.html#filepos329446"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">SKIP NOTES</span></span></span></a></p><blockquote id="filepos329080" class="calibre_5"><a href="#filepos306017"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">*</span></span></span></a><span class="calibre3"> Plutarch, essay, in </span><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">Plutarch’s Lives vol. 1,</span></span><span class="calibre3"> trans.
