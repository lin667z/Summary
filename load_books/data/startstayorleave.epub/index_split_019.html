Counsel and advice from people who know you and love you are essential. Gaining the approval of the crowd—whether that be your social media followers, the company you work for, or acquaintances who have yet to prove themselves as friends—at the expense of yourself, your time, your energy, and your well-being is rarely a good decision.

Brand-new to Congress, we were sitting at a restaurant in Washington, D.C., and even back then I could tell something was weighing heavily on him. He is cautious and not quick to trust, but I figured I would at least attempt to help. We were trying to navigate the early decisions—committees, <a></a>leadership positions, hiring staff—at the same time but not necessarily together. Not yet at least. And he had a lot more to navigate than I did.</p><p class="calibre_9">As one of only two Black Republicans in the House at the time and the most visible of all the freshmen in that historically large class, Tim Scott was being pulled in a thousand different directions. He was popular, and leadership had huge plans for him. The gist of it was that Tim felt external pressure because of the expectations of others. That night at dinner, he was feeling overwhelmed by the weight of it all. So I decided to offer some unsolicited advice to help him sort out the various options before him.</p><p class="calibre_9">“Can I ask you a question?” (Who says no to that question?) “How many of the people asking you to do things were with you while you were knocking on doors in the Charleston heat this past year?” He laughed and said none.</p><p class="calibre_9">“How many of the people asking you to loan your name to this or that know what it feels like to run against well-funded and renowned opponents?”</p><p class="calibre_9">He responded, “None, I guess.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“Tim, do not ever let other people spend the capital you worked so hard to acquire. You earned it; you spend it. If you want to do TV, do it. If you don’t, don’t. If you want to be on a committee, do it. If not, don’t. I don’t care what you do, just make sure you, and not others, are spending the capital you worked for.”</p><p class="calibre_9">There is a difference between being a Republican member of Congress who happens to be Black and being a Black Republican member of Congress. He wanted to be a congressman. Period. He did not want to lead with anything other than his hard-earned credentials. Other people wanted to use his clout and image for their own benefit. In politics people will use you as much as you allow them to. That’s true in many areas of life, though it may manifest more subtly outside the political sphere.</p><p class="calibre_9">What Tim needed was someone to validate his appropriate selfishness. Selfishness is something we are taught to avoid. But when it comes to your name, your imprimatur, your image, you should be selfish. Do what gets you to the closing argument you envision. Make decisions in accordance with your best interest and the best interest of those dearest to you. As much as you can, don’t look to the gallery for approval.</p><p class="calibre_9">I would point to this January 2011 dinner as the beginning of what became one of the most consequential relationships of my life. When someone trusts you with the gift of providing counsel and advice, you owe them advice that is in their best interest, not yours or anyone else’s. This is how you gain trusted confidants who will aid you in decision making. And just so the record is clear, that dinner in January 2011 may be the only time I have ever offered Tim Scott advice that was worth taking. He, on the other hand, has been one of my life’s most trusted advisers.</p><p class="calibre_9">There is something beautiful about a relationship where you know that the person offering you counsel has your best interest at heart. When you find that person, keep them close. Sometimes people offer you advice that is good for you and good for them. Sometimes, hopefully rarely, people will manipulate you by offering advice that is really intended just to benefit them. You are lucky if you have a person in your life who, when you turn to them, will give you their counsel solely for your betterment.</p><p class="calibre_9">I am reluctant to say Tim Scott is a Nathan, because in reality he is a senator and therefore is more like King David (minus the conspiracy to murder Uriah and adultery with Bathsheba). Our relationship is probably more akin to David and Jonathan—two people trying to navigate life and willing to do almost anything to help each other.</p><p class="calibre_9">Outside pressure will come from people you love and from strangers. It will come from people who need something from you and people who want to see you fail. But none of these people know you the way you know yourself, and you have to remind yourself of that when you are at a crossroads. They don’t have the full picture of the desires, consequences, dreams, burdens, risks, feelings, and fears that come with this decision; you are the one who knows those things best. No one is truly an expert on your life except you. It’s fine to get second opinions, but you will be the one living with the costs, benefits, and consequences of those decisions. So decide for yourself.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Expert of Your Life</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">I was sitting in my home office in Spartanburg, having just come home for August recess in 2011. Our son, Watson, who had just graduated from high school, came in, and I could tell by the look on his face he was troubled by something. “I think Palo Alto is too far from home” was what came out of his mouth. Palo Alto is home to Stanford University, where we were about to drop him off to start college. We had visited earlier in the spring for a tour of the campus. It is a beautiful campus, and Stanford has a tremendous academic reputation. It was his dream school…with the operative word being “was.”</p><p class="calibre_9">I sat in my office thinking of all the things he had sacrificed during the first seventeen years of his life. I thought of the social events he skipped so he could study. I thought of the family trips we took, him lugging that backpack with all of his books in it. Before I could get up to have an “Are you sure?” conversation with our son, his chief ally came into my office to join us. His mother had a pretty simple analysis of what had just happened: “You may have a different opinion, but he has earned the right to say no.”</p><p class="calibre_9">And the irony was not lost on me, for she had experienced the same thing in her own life and then with our daughter, Abigail. Terri grew up in the theater with her parents. She could act, she could sing, and she could dance. She was a born performer. She had everything you needed for a career <a></a>onstage—except a desire. So, of course, because God has a sense of humor, He sent her a daughter who could match her mom in terms of theatrical ability. Abigail was in school plays and community theater from a young age. Not only did performing in front of crowds not seem to bother her, she relished the pressure of live performances. Abigail could have done whatever she wanted in school or community theater, and she did. She did exactly what she wanted. She decided to leave. She stopped performing. As parents you wonder whether you should push your kids, force them to use their talents. You wonder why God or genetics would have given someone an ability only to squander that ability. And then you remember that others thinking you are good at something is very different from you liking that something.</p><p class="calibre_9">I don’t know if I should have tried one more time to get Watson to go to Stanford. He chose Clemson, had a wonderful time majoring in philosophy, then graduated from law school, and seems to have no regrets. It is, after all, his life. I don’t know if Terri and I should have “forced” Abigail to participate in more theater, sing more often, or take advantage of her acting skills. I know she graduated from college and law school and will soon embark on a career as a trial lawyer, which is acting and performing on a different stage. I know that every time she believes she needs some money, I get to witness one of the best acting performances in the history of the world.</p><p class="calibre_9">We could pressure and cajole our loved ones into walking <a></a>down different paths, but at the end of the day, they are the keepers of their own decisions. I am proud of my children for not going along with their parents’ wishes when it meant sacrificing themselves in a way they didn’t want to, even though we had their best interest in mind. Their choices were the right ones for them, not us.</p><p class="calibre_9">And there is a lesson here for all of us. Sometimes people will disagree with a decision we have made. Sometimes <span class="italic">everyone</span> will disagree with a decision we have made. There is a category of decision making where I have adopted a mantra: “You are probably right, and I may regret this decision, but I have earned the right to be wrong.” Our son earned the right to attend the school he wanted to attend, not the one his father picked for him. Our daughter earned the right to end her theatrical career. After all, she had to walk onto the stage, not me. I earned the right to leave a job some people would never have left willingly. It is your life. And while you should strive to make the best decisions and rely on the wise counsel of those who have your best interest in mind, from time to time, it is okay to say, “I’ve earned the right to be wrong.”</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Someone Else’s Final Image of You</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Shortly after Donald J. Trump won the 2016 presidential election, I received a call from Tim Scott. He could barely get the words out because he was overcome with emotion. “Now is our chance, now we can finally do it; you can be on the Fourth <a></a>Circuit Court of Appeals.” I could not help but think back on my dad’s story about Donald Russell, the man for whom the courthouse in my hometown was named. He had made it all the way to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. It was the pinnacle of a lawyer’s career. It was the top of that pyramid I used to think about.</p><p class="calibre_9">Sure, confirmation would be rough. It’s hard to wash the D or the R off and move from politics to the judiciary, but there were a surprising number of supportive Democrats back home in South Carolina. All of the pieces were in place as well as they would ever be in place. A Republican president, a Republican-controlled Senate, two supportive home-state senators, and two openings on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The symmetry was inescapable. The kid who grew up thinking Donald Russell’s career was the pinnacle of a life well lived would have a chance to be on the very same court Donald Russell served on.</p><p class="calibre_9">The only thing missing was…my interest. What had once been a faraway dream and my idea of a validated life well lived was no longer what motivated me. Speaking of honorable exits, what could be a more “honorable” exit from Congress than to be a federal judge?</p><p class="calibre_9">It was not just my wedding pastor’s expectations for my life that had changed; it was my own. After Tim called, I realized I had finally scaled the toughest mountain of all, which was to let go of the images and expectations others create for me. I <a></a>once had a dream of becoming a federal judge. I left it where I should have left it long ago: in the past.</p><p class="calibre_9">In the pyramid version of life, that would have been a very fine topping. Not quite Donald Russell but pretty doggone good. Federal prosecutor, state solicitor, member of Congress, and Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals judge. <span class="italic">That</span> would make up for not making it into the pages of my high school yearbook. <span class="italic">That</span> would be even better than what the pastor predicted. But the pyramid was gone.</p><p class="calibre_9">I stood in the kitchen of my home in Spartanburg listening to my most trusted adviser—Terri. Yes, a judgeship would be retirement security. Yes, it would be safe, in that there would be no need to find clients or make payroll. But I had reached the point in life where who I worked with and was around meant more to me than what I did. People, not positions. What I did was less important to me than who I did it with. I wanted to be around familiar faces, even if it meant teaching a college class rather than being a judge. I would rather stay home in Spartanburg than travel to Richmond, Virginia, where the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals sits and hears cases once a month. I already had what I wanted, which was a life that my wife and parents and children could be proud of. And beyond that, I was going to teach college classes with Sheria and Mary-Langston, and play golf with my friends, and stay home with Terri. And all of that was finally enough. Financial security is great. Peace is priceless. What I did to support my <a></a>family was no longer the single most important part of life. Who I surrounded myself with every day was.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you are imagining the final photograph of your life—who is in it and what you accomplished—make sure that you know beyond a shadow of a doubt that you are the one who orchestrated that photo. Make sure it accomplishes your vision and not someone else’s. You are the author of your life, so make sure your decisions reflect that.</p><p class="calibre_9">President Trump’s White House Counsel, Don McGahn, called twice to make sure I was not interested. Then he called one last time. I can take you to the very spot where I was, standing close to a window so I did not drop a call from the White House Counsel.</p><p class="calibre_9">Don said, “We are going to have to find someone else for these slots, but I want to make absolutely sure you really do not want to pursue this.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“Thank you, Don,” I replied. “And please let the president know how grateful I am, but I do not want this anymore.”</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_20"></div>
