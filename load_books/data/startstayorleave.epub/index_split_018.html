He told me not to answer my phone for a while. <span class="italic">Okay,</span> I thought<span class="italic">, that’s a weird request, especially for someone who just called me on my phone</span>. Mick is not prone to flights of fancy or sensationalism. “Can I ask why?” I said. “Yes,” he replied, “but I’m not going <a></a>to tell you. Something is going to happen, and you do not need to be part of it. You are friends with many of us, and you are friends with leadership, and you do not need to be caught in the middle of this.” That sounded very ominous.</p><p class="calibre_9">I followed his advice, but in truth, no one called. In the days to come, the Freedom Caucus was born. Mick Mulvaney and Jeff Duncan, members of Congress from South Carolina with whom I shared counties, were charter members. It seemed as if battle lines were being drawn between House GOP leadership and a group of conservatives who wanted to take the conference more to the right. The traditional methods of argument, debate, negotiation, and relationships were not working, and thus was born the group that ultimately brought down Speaker John Boehner a year later, in the fall of 2015.</p><p class="calibre_9">In January 2015, I had an inkling that my time in Congress might be drawing to an end. The Benghazi Committee was in full swing, there was a presidential race coming, and there were fissures seething within the Republican conference.</p><p class="calibre_9">Even so, I arrived at the airport in Greenville, South Carolina, to fly to D.C. for my swearing-in to the 114th United States Congress. There was a snowstorm on the East Coast and my flight was canceled. I hated to miss the swearing-in, and, perhaps even more important, it was also the day we voted for Speaker of the House. Missing votes is not great, but bad weather is a better excuse than oversleeping or playing golf, so it would not be the end of the world, I thought. And <a></a>then the calls began to come: Was I going to make it in time for the Speaker’s vote? What began in 2013 as a mild insurgency against John Boehner was in full bloom. The Speaker’s staff was calling. I thought to myself, <span class="italic">If they are calling individual members to make sure they will be in attendance and voting, this is going to be very, very close.</span></p><p class="calibre_9">As with the previous Speaker race, anyone who wanted to run for Speaker could. No one did except John Boehner. He was the nominee, and I failed to see the benefit of more floor drama once that was decided. Again, if you want to get rid of Boehner, do it in the primary election, not the general election. Do it when we meet as a Republican “family” behind closed doors, not when the only people it emboldens are folks on the other side. But fame had become entrenched as the ultimate political virtue by then. You aren’t going to get on cable TV criticizing Nancy Pelosi—there is too much competition. You need to criticize your own team publicly if you want to break through the news and jump-start your online fundraising. You don’t become famous by opposing the other side; you become famous by fighting your own.</p><p class="calibre_9">Even though I drove to Charlotte that day to try to catch a flight to D.C. in time for the Speaker’s vote, I didn’t end up voting for John Boehner for Speaker of the House in 2015 because I was not there in time. Instead, I put out a statement I drafted on my phone at the airport saying that, had I been there, I would have voted for Boehner. That wound up being the single most disliked move I made among my constituents <a></a>back home. Think about that for a second. I cast countless votes from 2011 to 2014, each of which was almost guaranteed to make someone—probably lots of people—mad. But the single most disliked vote I cast was actually one I did not cast because I was not there. Boehner won with 216 votes, which is less than half of the House. This time 25 Republican House members voted for someone other than Boehner.</p><p class="calibre_9">It took until April 2015 for the anger to die down in my district. When I was home for Easter recess and met with constituents, only one brought up the January vote/nonvote for Boehner. Before that, my nonvote vote dominated every district meeting I had. And that is par for the course. People are upset, time passes, anger cools, there are other battles to wage, and we move on. And everyone did move on…until right before the August 2015 recess.</p><p class="calibre_9">August recess is a strange time in Congress. Something always seems to happen right before we go home for a month to meet with constituents or have town halls. Some fellow Republican has an idea on how to make life miserable for their colleagues by changing the conversation from what the Democrats are doing to some Republican purity test. In July 2015, I was sitting at my desk in the Rayburn House Office Building when Kevin McCarthy called. There were rumblings that someone would file a preferred resolution to take down the Speaker and make us vote all over again on John Boehner. The wounds had barely healed from January 2015, and here we were again, one year from a presidential race with control <a></a>of the House, Senate, and White House on the ballot, and the single best use of our time was to relitigate the Speaker of the House?</p><p class="calibre_9">I told Kevin, “I cannot do this again.” Kevin said he was trying to keep it from happening but to be prepared to vote.</p><p class="calibre_9">I turned away from my phone and toward my computer and began typing my announcement that I would not run for Congress again. Manufactured drama after manufactured drama. I thought this might be that definitive sign I had been looking for. I was not certain that I could survive a Republican primary the following year if I had voted for John Boehner for Speaker twice in the course of seven months. And I was not going to stick around to find out. <span class="italic">Announce that you are done. Don’t quit. Don’t resign. Don’t bail out. Just let the district back home know that you will save them the trouble of pushing you out the window. You will jump yourself.</span></p><p class="calibre_9">I had already planned for this to be my last term. It had been building for some time. I did not enjoy politics anymore and the Benghazi investigation was unrelenting. I wanted to conclude that investigation and then not seek reelection. But Benghazi was not over at this point, so it would be foolish to announce that while still trying to chair a committee. In some lines of work, announcing you are leaving might not carry consequences. But politics is different. The moment you announce you are leaving, you are irrelevant, marginalized, and soon forgotten. It’s a very transactional line of work. If you are gone, you cannot help those who are still in the game, and <a></a>therefore you are no longer relevant. My plan had been to finish the investigation into Benghazi before March 2016, which is when the filing season opens for Congress in South Carolina. Finish the work I was assigned, announce I am not seeking another term, and leave for good in January 2017 when the new member from this district is sworn in. That was the plan. But it depended on finishing the Benghazi investigation in a timely fashion and it depended on not having some emergency in the interim. Continuing to vote time after time after time on Speaker was a political nightmare.</p><p class="calibre_9">I asked my director of communications, Amanda Duvall, to step into my office. She was a wonderful director of communications but an even better person. I cared what she thought professionally and personally. “Please don’t do this,” was her response to what I had written. “Not like this. This is a reaction. Wait and do it on your terms.” I respected her judgment tremendously. But I was not going to try to live through another Speaker vote, and I was increasingly frustrated—perhaps even angry—at those Republicans who find their fullest and strongest voice when criticizing other Republicans. Of all the things to discuss when each of us is home during the month of August, how does it benefit the larger goals to be relitigating a Speaker vote?</p><p class="calibre_9">McCarthy called me back, several hours after his first call, with the news that he had somehow, some way managed to avoid a vote on Boehner right before we went home to our districts for August recess. My announcement was drafted <a></a>and sitting in the drawer of my desk. But it was not needed. Later that fall, Boehner announced he was leaving. He was resigning the Speakership and resigning from Congress.</p><p class="calibre_9">Later in the fall of 2015, I was at dinner with Tim Scott, and I shared with him that I was not going to run again in 2016. I had been gone from home for nearly five years, and I was ready to be back in South Carolina full-time. I did not thrive in an environment of constant conflict, especially when that conflict was often among people who are supposed to be like-minded. The media headwind was getting worse. The internecine bickering was getting worse. I just did not enjoy being in Congress, and I was getting to the point in life where I wanted to prioritize other things.</p><p class="calibre_9">I told Tim the story of Norman Starnes, a Lexington, South Carolina, man who killed two friends, buried them in a remote part of South Carolina, urinated on their graves, and then led the search for the “missing” men. What does that have to do with Congress? Norman Starnes represented himself in the subsequent death penalty trial. He was his own lawyer, which means I had to meet with him and the judge frequently before the trial began. And once the trial began, I had to meet with him daily in the judge’s chambers. When is the last time you had a conversation with someone you were trying to put on death row? And yet there was no acrimony. There were disagreements about the law and the relevance of certain facts but not the mindless bickering that had become our modern political environment and certainly no <a></a>underhanded tricks. There was, quite literally, more civility in that death penalty trial than in some aspects of Congress—even when dealing with my own side of the aisle.</p><p class="calibre_9">So I shared with Tim the plan: finish the investigation I was assigned by the spring of 2016 before filing for reelection opened, do not file for reelection, and head back home at the end of the term.</p><p class="calibre_9">Tim said he understood, but he asked me to do one thing for him: Pray about it. I said I would, but I don’t think I ever did. I may have asked Terri to do it, but my mind was made up, and I was pretty sure God would understand why someone would rather be in South Carolina playing golf than fretting over Speaker votes in D.C.</p><p class="calibre_9">I did understand Tim’s request. Washington can be lonely, and politics is often isolating. Having a true friend is rare. Tim and I were lucky in that not only did we have each other, but we also had Kevin McCarthy and John Ratcliffe and Sheria Clarke and Mary-Langston Willis Don and others who were true, earnest friends. Still, there was then—and remains now—a bond between Tim Scott and me that is hard to put into words. So, as we approached the holidays in 2015, he put my decision in very personal terms.</p><p class="calibre_9">He said, “I am on the ballot in 2016 myself. I am seeking my first full term as an elected United States senator. I am asking you as my friend to stick it out for one more term. Just one more. Let’s run together, let’s campaign together, let’s <a></a>serve our state and our country together one more time. And then I promise I will never ask you to do that again. This town can be a lonely place. Let’s stick together.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Tim Scott has done so much for me, my family, and our state. I did not want to run again in 2016. But because some decisions must take into account personal relationships and commitments, I did it anyway. We kept our word to each other. Not only did we both run in 2016, but we ran together, even debating our general election opponents together at the same time on the same stage. And he kept his word and never again tried to talk me out of leaving Congress.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Finally Leaving</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">I knew my fourth term in Congress would be my last because I knew my third term <span class="italic">should have been</span> my last. Tim Scott was the only non–family member who knew what the final plan would be. And I could not announce it to others because, as noted above, as soon as your co-workers know or perceive you are leaving a job, it impacts how they view you.</p><p class="calibre_9">Heading into that fourth and final term in office, I applied for a position on the House Intelligence Committee. That committee is actually the hardest committee in Congress to get on, widely viewed as conducting some of the most significant work in the House. There is no steering committee when it comes to the House Intelligence <a></a>Committee. The Speaker and the Speaker alone decides who will serve. Speaker Paul Ryan, who replaced John Boehner in the fall of 2015, put me on that committee as a reward of sorts. The Select Committee on Benghazi had been a very difficult assignment, and I believe he wanted to offer me a less controversial one.</p><p class="calibre_9">Less than one month into this new “less controversial” assignment on the House Intelligence Committee, it was announced that the committee would be investigating whether Russia interfered with the 2016 election and who, if anyone, conspired with them. What had been a noncontroversial committee would soon become the new tip of the spear for political fighting. Chairman Devin Nunes would investigate what happened, and he tasked Tom Rooney, Mike Conaway, and me to interview dozens and dozens of witnesses. It was almost as if it was fate’s way of saying, “It does not matter what committees you are on or what role you play on those committees. Controversy, acrimony, and political infighting will follow you there.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Before I publicly announced I would be leaving at the end of the term and not seeking reelection, I owed Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan the courtesy of telling them. Kevin, I knew, would understand. We had spent a lot of time around each other, and he would not question the decision. It was Paul I was worried about. I thought he would do something similar to what Tim had done, which was to make a personal appeal for me to stay.</p><p class="calibre_9">In January 2018, I made an appointment with Paul and walked into his office. I thanked him for everything he had done for me and said, “I’m not running again.”</p><p class="calibre_9">I thought he would say, “Wait a minute, I picked you for the opening on House Intelligence and you are leaving after one term? I supported you for chairman of the Oversight Committee and you are leaving with five years left to serve as chairman? There is a vacancy coming up in the chairmanship on House Judiciary and you are leaving? You were one of the ones who talked me into running for Speaker, which I did not want to do, and now you are leaving?”</p><p class="calibre_9">That’s the reaction I was dreading.</p><p class="calibre_9">He did not say any of that.</p><p class="calibre_9">He asked, “How did you know it was the right time?”</p><p class="calibre_9">I answered him the same way I did everyone else, which was, “I don’t like it, and I’m not good at it.” That is enough to get you through a conversation at the grocery store but not enough for the Speaker of the House. Paul’s response was, “Don’t tell me you aren’t ‘good’ at it. You have chaired two committees in less than four terms. You got a chairmanship way before I did. I had to wait years and years to get the chairmanship of Budget. You are one of the few people I stop and watch when you come on C-SPAN for a floor speech or committee work. Don’t tell me you are not ‘good’ at it.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“Okay, Paul. I do not like it and I do not want to be good at it. It is relativism. The end justifies the means. Your friends betray you. The media is a daily headwind. I do not want to <a></a>be good at this, not anymore.”</p><p class="calibre_9">We talked about how much politics and Congress had changed since he first came to Congress in 1998. I reminded him of how much things had changed even in the short seven years I had been there. When I was running for Congress in 2009, I read everything Paul Ryan wrote. He had a road map for entitlement reform, he had a road map for fiscal responsibility, and he had a road map for healthcare reform. He burst onto the scene when President Obama brought some members of Congress to the White House for a roundtable on healthcare reform. There was this young-looking member of Congress from Wisconsin, holding his own with the leader of the free world. Paul did not need notes. He did not need a staffer whispering in his ear. He was the smartest kid in the class, and the rest of the class knew it.</p><p class="calibre_9">I reminded him of something that happened in my first six months of Congress, long before Paul and I knew each other very well. We had a contentious vote coming up on a short-term budget resolution. Many folks back home in South Carolina, including the leaders of the various conservative groups, opposed a yes vote, but to vote no would be to have a government shutdown, so GOP leadership in the House advocated for a yes. I was merely months removed from a courtroom and now in the throes of a difficult political vote guaranteed to make people upset no matter what, so I caught up to him as we were walking from the Capitol back to the Longworth House Office Building where our offices were. Honestly, I do <a></a>not think he knew my name. Why would he? He was the smartest kid in the class, and he didn’t even know I was attending the same school. “I’ve got a problem back home and was wondering how you might handle it,” I said. “A lot of the conservative leaders in my district want me to vote no, but you and others in the conference are recommending a yes vote. What am I supposed to do?”</p><p class="calibre_9">He gave me some reasons for a yes vote and then, before he bounded up the stairs, said this: “Get me the names of your constituents and I will call them.” So I wrote the names and phone numbers of six conservative leaders in my district on a piece of paper and dropped it by his office. And he called every one of them to explain why he was recommending a yes vote. And at the end of those conversations, five of the six now recommended a yes vote themselves and the sixth one didn’t care—he was just so appreciative that someone like Paul Ryan would take the time to call.</p><p class="calibre_9">That was 2011. In the fall of 2012, Paul Ryan was the GOP nominee for vice president of the United States. Later he would chair the Ways and Means Committee and then accept the job of Speaker even though he did not want it.</p><p class="calibre_9">My, how things had changed. He was, to me, still the smartest kid in the class, but the class had changed. Smart wasn’t enough anymore. Even as I sat in his office telling him I was leaving, there were those same rumblings within the GOP conference among that group that didn’t think he was tough enough, didn’t fight hard enough, or wasn’t <a></a>bare-knuckled enough. I do not think Paul Ryan changed one bit in the seven years I had been working with him up to that point. But what some members of the Republican congressional conference wanted had definitely changed. They did not want Boehner. They did not want McCarthy. They did not want Ryan. Or maybe it was just more profitable for their own political ambitions to oppose whoever was in charge?</p><p class="calibre_9">How did I know it was time to leave? When everything changed. When what was once valued was no longer valued. When the expectations of co-workers changed and not for the better. When fame became the singular and ultimate political virtue.</p><p class="calibre_9">I left Paul Ryan’s office knowing, or at least sensing, that I was not the only one leaving the House at the end of the term. Paul Ryan would be leaving too, but he was going to announce it in his own time and in his own way. And leave he did. The chairman of a congressional committee who also had a highly coveted assignment on the Intelligence Committee left. More to the point, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, third in line to the presidency, left too.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Own Your Decisions, Own Your Regrets</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">We’ve all heard people muse that they have “no regrets” in life. I find it astonishing that people can find nothing in their lives they would not do over, do better, or do differently. There is a certain arrogance to believing you have lived a life with zero <a></a>decisions you would reconsider.</p><p class="calibre_9">To me, having regrets is one of the most universal human emotions. Regrets are a natural part of self-reflection. To not have any regrets, to me, implies a lack of introspection. I regret things I have said and done. I regret things I have not said and not done. I regret correct decisions I made for incorrect reasons and some things, quite candidly, that I would do all over again.</p><p class="calibre_9">One of those regrets is not doing better in high school and college. I regret it for two reasons. Number one: It would have brought pride to my father. But a close second is that I spent a lot of life playing catch-up. Even though I was supposed to read <span class="italic">The Catcher in the Rye</span> in high school, I did not. There is a season when learning should be a full-time job, and that is high school and college. I am still trying to make up for the books I was supposed to read when I had the time to do it. At my age, I fall asleep reading <span class="italic">Goodnight Moon,</span> let alone <span class="italic">Moby-Dick</span>. Oh, to have read it at the age of seventeen. (Well, actually, it’s a pretty long book, so maybe I would have fallen asleep then too. Who knows?)</p><p class="calibre_9">The question is not so much whether we will have regrets but what we allow those regrets to turn into. Regret can be a teacher. Regret can help one to be a better parent or spouse or friend. Regret can sometimes even morph into what we simply call remembrances—remembrances of our old self that inform and better our current and future selves.</p><p class="calibre_9">Do not let regret beat you down and fill you with shame, <a></a>guilt, or self-pity. The past is the one thing we are guaranteed never to be able to change. Let it teach you, let it remind you, let it inspire you. Do not ever let regret imprison you.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3">How to turn regret into remembrance:</span></p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Be honest with yourself about what happened. Don’t sugarcoat it, avoid it, or deny it.</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Reflect on what you learned about yourself and/or others during the experience.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">Erase “if only” from your vocabulary. Those words hold you in an endless thought pattern that goes nowhere. Replace them with “next time” or “now that I know.”</blockquote></li></ul><p class="calibre_9">We cannot pursue every opportunity in life. We have to say no to many opportunities, and in doing so, we leave those paths permanently in the rearview mirror. We should not waste time looking down paths we can no longer take. Rather, we should focus on the lessons we learned on the road we actually traveled.</p><p class="calibre_9">When we consider past decisions, it is well-nigh impossible to separate the various threads of life from one another. A poor vocational decision may turn out to be one of the best relational decisions you’ve ever made. A poor educational decision may result in a spiritual blessing. To fairly judge the decisions we have made, we must consider all of life’s spheres and spectrums.</p><p class="calibre_9">The decision to leave the Circuit Solicitor’s Office was the right decision. The decision to seek an honorable exit, one that did not require a lot of explaining, was probably also the right one. I cannot tell you whether running for Congress was the correct decision in hindsight. I met people who will be friends until the day I die. I met the man who will preach my funeral. I met the two women who will read the Bible at the service. I met people I will stay in contact with until Terri takes my cellphone away from me at the old folks’ home for cheating at Wordle.</p><p class="calibre_9">I cannot imagine life without some of the people I met from 2011 until 2019. Some were members of the House and Senate. Some were staff members on committees. Some were waiters and waitresses at local restaurants. Some were police officers protecting the Capitol. And that was just in D.C. Back home in South Carolina, I met people I never would have encountered had I not been in Congress: business leaders, concerned citizens, students, people who agreed with me some, and people who did not agree with me at all.</p><p class="calibre_9">And yet the role in which I met them sapped any desire to ever be in public service again. It made me even more cynical about government and political discourse and especially the D.C. print media. It is one thing to navigate life knowing who your opponents are, what the rules of the game will be, and that a referee will make sure things are fair. It is quite another when the hardest blows are struck by those with your same jersey, when winning by any means seems to be the only <a></a>goal, and when the referee is biased. Hopefully those aspects of our politics will change one day. But it’s not likely in my lifetime. And even if they do change in my lifetime, I am done.</p><p class="calibre_9">Sometimes we make the “wrong” decision in life, and it turns out okay. Sometimes we make the “right” decision in life, and the results are not what we want or expect. To call these regrets is too simplistic. It’s just a mixed verdict. I gained lifelong friends and a love for our country in Congress, and I saw people who acted like friends strike the hardest blows. I ultimately lost any desire to be part of the government of our country.</p><p class="calibre_9">I don’t know what to call that. So, let’s just call it Congress and be done with it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_19"></div>
