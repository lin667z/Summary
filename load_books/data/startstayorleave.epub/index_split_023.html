</p><p class="calibre_3">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</p><p class="calibre_9">Terri, Watson, and Abigail, thank you for being the joy of my life.</p><p class="calibre_9">Mom and Dad, thank you for valuing education and hard work and providing more for your children than either of you had growing up.</p><p class="calibre_9">Laura, Caroline, and Elizabeth, thank you for being the best sisters any brother could have.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to the women and men at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, the 7th Circuit Solicitor’s Office, and the 4th Congressional District Offices for your service to our state and country.</p><p class="calibre_9">Scattered among the pages of this book you will see some of my favorite colleagues from Congress, but I want to say a special thank-you to Tim Scott, Johnny Ratcliffe, and Kevin McCarthy. When people ask what I miss about Congress, it is you.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to the families who trusted me to prosecute cases involving their loved ones. There is a bond forged in pain and loss that transcends time and tenure in office.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to the women and men in law enforcement for <a></a>giving me what I always wanted: a job I could be proud of at the end of life.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to my friends, some of whom are mentioned in this book and many of whom I have had for decades, for the depth, breadth, and texture you added to my life.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to Cindy Crick, Missy House, Mary-Langston Willis Don, and Sheria Clarke for sticking with me these many years.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to Esther Fedorkevich for relentlessly telling me to do this. And to Tori Thatcher for making the process so much fun.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank you to Mary Reynics and the entire Crown Forum team for giving me a chance to write about what I really wanted to write about and not what others perhaps may have expected me to write about.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_24"></div>
