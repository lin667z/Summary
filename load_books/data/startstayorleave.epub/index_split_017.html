When you are considering leaving something, it is important to assess the environment you’re in and decide if it is an environment that will lead to your growth or draw you off course. When we leave environments that don’t serve us or reflect our values, we take a step toward growing into who we are trying to become.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Election Season</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When I thought about running for Congress for the first time, the primary drawback wasn’t going to Washington each week, even though I later grew to loathe airports, middle seats on planes, and sleeping on a pullout couch. It wasn’t learning about healthcare, foreign policy, or the tax code; learning is fun, especially when it involves areas wherein you have no previous experiences or knowledge. The primary drawback <a></a>was the fact that there was already a Republican member of Congress representing my district, and I just did not want to run against an incumbent again—certainly not one I knew.</p><p class="calibre_9">In May 2009, while I was still trying to decide what my next career move would be, someone sent me an article listing all 435 members of Congress and ranking them based on some measure of “effectiveness.” Admittedly, it is hard to measure “effectiveness” as it relates to members of Congress, but one publication at least tried to, and our congressman was ranked fifth from the bottom. While I’m not sure I agreed with the metrics, being ranked fifth from the bottom, regardless of metric, certainly isn’t ideal, nor does it bode well for the area you purport to represent.</p><p class="calibre_9">The media, and perhaps the public, judge “success” for a member of Congress based on how many bills they sponsored, passed, and signed into law. This is a terrible way to judge success for myriad reasons. What if your entire time in Congress was spent in the minority? You will never have a bill signed into law, but that cannot possibly mean that every member of Congress who serves in the minority is “ineffective.” Moreover, conservatism, at least in part, is supposed to be about limited government at the federal level. So how can getting bills signed into law be good when one of the tenets of your political orthodoxy is fewer federal laws? When I look back on my own eight years in Congress and reflect on what was most “effective” or “consequential,” it was a program at local schools that almost no one even knew about. It wasn’t <a></a>bills signed into law or committee hearings or media appearances. It was recognizing young people who had overcome tragedy and obstacles and still managed to achieve. I know that now. But this was then, and I did not know what it meant to be an “effective” member of Congress.</p><p class="calibre_9">I went to a lunch event in Spartanburg where our current congressman spoke. It was clear from his talk that he was focused on issues the rest of the district was not. I remember thinking to myself walking to my truck after that lunch event in 2009, <span class="italic">Next year will be a tough year for incumbents. Bob [Inglis] will need to do a better job with his stump speech or he will draw a slew of opponents.</span> And a slew of opponents he did draw.</p><p class="calibre_9">Healthcare was dominating the national discussion. President Obama had been in office less than one year and the Tea Party had emerged in some states as a reaction to the president and his legislative agenda. The Tea Party was rising to oppose not only the incumbent Democratic president but also to oppose Republicans deemed insufficiently conservative, whatever that means and however it is defined. They were trying to shake up the status quo. It was a good time to be a challenger and a bad time to be the incumbent. A woman who was active in the Spartanburg County Tea Party movement announced she was running for Congress in the Republican primary in 2010. A man closely connected with the Greenville County Tea Party movement announced that he, too, was running. A Republican state senator announced that <a></a>he, three, was running. Someone, I thought, is going to beat Bob Inglis in the Republican primary for Congress in 2010. The question then became who that someone would be.</p><p class="calibre_9">So I stood in my front yard in June 2009 with Terri and our two children and announced what I thought to be that honorable exit from the courtroom I was looking for: Congress.</p><p class="calibre_9">I was far from the only primary challenger who could beat Bob Inglis, but I was the one he spent the most amount of time talking about. At several election events, he mocked my decision to leave the courtroom. At one event, with my wife in attendance, Congressman Inglis turned his back to the audience and spent his allotted speaking time simply training his ire on me. There was one event in a church near Traveler’s Rest, South Carolina, where Bob leveled the two worst accusations you can level against me: He said I was sitting there in my “fancy suit” with my “twenty-five-dollar haircut.” Wait a dadgum minute, mister! You leave my hair out of this! That is negative campaigning!</p><p class="calibre_9">I liked Bob Inglis as a person, but he was going to lose that congressional race. South Carolina is a run-off state, and after the first primary day in early June 2010, it was just Bob and me and a two-week sprint to the run-off election. Two weeks later, Bob lost the run-off by nearly 70 percent to 30 percent. It was not close. It was never going to be close. The winds of change were blowing through the nation and our district.</p><p class="calibre_9">There were most assuredly moments during the <a></a>congressional race when I wondered whether I had made the right decision. Some people call it regret, some call it second-guessing. I understood full well what I was leaving, but I did not have a clear idea of what I was running for or trying to start.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Lay of the Land</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">At congressional orientation, the historically large freshman class elected in November 2010 listened to speakers from leadership and got to know one another. There were some very high-profile members of that freshman class, like Kristi Noem and Sean Duffy and Jon Runyan. But the most well-known member of the freshman class of 2010 was another guy from South Carolina named Tim Scott. I had heard about Tim—we all had—but I had never met him.</p><p class="calibre_9">I remember doing no talking and lots of listening during orientation. I honestly believed myself to be the least qualified person in that class. That is not modesty; that is a pretty objectively accurate assessment of the freshman class. During the campaign, Bob Inglis remarked that my newness and inexperience would mean that I would have trouble finding the bathrooms in the House office buildings. And he was right—it took me longer than I care to admit.</p><p class="calibre_9">Because the House is so committee-centric and the vast majority of your time is spent on committee work as opposed <a></a>to any other part of the job, picking the right committees is vital to your congressional service. Most members of Congress are on two committees, some serve on three, and only the unluckiest of all are drafted for four committees.</p><p class="calibre_9">You can have the greatest ideas in the world, but if you are not on the right committees, those ideas will go nowhere. Some committees are highly coveted because the work is substantive but also because fundraising is good on those committees. (Before anyone gets too cynical about the role fundraising plays in politics, let’s be frank: Money is the lifeblood of a campaign. You need it to introduce yourself to the voters, you need it to express your positions on the issues, and you need it to defend yourself against opponents who are seeking to define you. There is a reason the candidates with the most money usually win. A solid week of television ads in my district costs about $60,000. For a week! And you need to be on television for months to have your ads be effective. I could go on, but you get the point. Fundraising, no matter how distasteful, matters.)</p><p class="calibre_9">So the most important decision you make initially is which committees you will serve on. And then you have to actually be picked for those committees. Who decides which members are on which committees, you ask? Both parties have steering committees, which consist of members elected from within the large caucus, who in coordination with leadership (Speaker, majority or minority leader, and the whips) populate the committees. If you want good <a></a>committee assignments, you must help the bigger team (pay your dues), have some reason for that assignment (your background, your district, your areas of expertise), and have some relationship with leadership or others on the steering committee.</p><p class="calibre_9">I wanted to be on two committees: (1) Judiciary and (2) Oversight and Reform. Those committees had investigative components to them and having a legal background would be helpful. But neither is a good fundraising committee, and neither was considered an “A” committee by other members of Congress. The Financial Services Committee, on the other hand, was a great fundraising committee and was considered either an “A” committee, or at least a solid “B+.” Financial Services was not my background or my area of interest. So immediately I had a choice: Do I pick the committee with the work I want to do or do I pick the committee most likely to help me get reelected? I opted for the work I would enjoy the most rather than the committee with the easier fundraising path.</p><p class="calibre_9">My three committee assignments were Judiciary, Oversight and Reform, and Education and the Workforce. Two of those committees (Oversight and Government Reform, and Education and the Workforce) were not highly coveted at all. Serving on committees, fundraising, and meeting with constituents is where the majority of my time in Congress was spent, but I would be remiss if I didn’t share the nonwork side with you as well, as that certainly made up the environment of the job just <a></a>as much.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Life Outside Work</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">To understand the nonvoting or non-committee side of Congress, you have to know how the calendar works. The House calendar is published well in advance. You know in November 2010 what the calendar will be for the entire year of 2011. You know when Congress is in session, when first votes are for each week, and when you will be in your district on what the media calls “vacation” but the members know as “in-district workweeks.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Most months I had to spend between nine and twelve nights in Washington. One of my earliest tasks was deciding where I was going to live, sleep, and shower for nine to twelve nights a month in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world. After looking briefly for a place of my own, I couldn’t justify spending a lot of money to rent an apartment I would use, at best, half the nights of the month. So I wound up doing what many other members did, which was sleeping in my office.</p><p class="calibre_9">After spending several months looking for a small apartment or a room within a house, I switched my efforts to looking for something to sleep on in my office and a shower to use in the House office buildings that did not resemble the movie <span class="italic">The Shawshank Redemption</span>. I tried a couch. It was terrible. I <a></a>tried an air mattress. It was like sleeping on a raft in the Pacific Ocean during a tsunami. Plus, you could hear, see, and occasionally feel mice in the building. I named the one I saw each night my first year in Congress “Leonidas.” I wound up purchasing a pullout couch. It brought back memories of vacations at the beach as a kid when my parents relegated me to sleeping on the pullout at whatever beach house we rented.</p><p class="calibre_9">As disquieting as the mice were, it turns out they were not the only thing keeping me up at night. The biggest headwind I faced in Washington was the D.C. media, typically patting itself on the back for “speaking truth to power,” claiming “democracy dies in darkness,” printing “all the news that’s fit to print”—just never getting around to being fair or really even faking fairness.</p><p class="calibre_9">People still ask me, “How did you work with (fill in the blank),” with the blank being whichever Democratic legislator they disliked the most. Democratic legislators never claimed to be fair. Like defense attorneys in criminal trials, they believed they had a job to do. And since winning is the only thing that matters in politics, you almost anticipated members’ relativism and therefore were not surprised by it. That is the nature of politics. Do whatever it takes to win. My expectations were not high, and therefore I was rarely disappointed by my Democratic colleagues and what they did or said. Truth be told, there were Democratic members of the House who were far more fair than the media, the group that claimed to be free, bold, fair, and whatever other self-laudatory <a></a>platitudes the D.C. print media used to described itself.</p><p class="calibre_9">The media is a different story for a longer book, but I will hit the highlights here, because I found that they contribute more to the negative atmosphere on Capitol Hill than the members they accuse of hyper-partisanship. The media purports to be society’s judge, that neutral, detached, dispassionate keeper of all things true. They simply call balls and strikes as they see them. That is what they say, at least. It’s just not what they do.</p><p class="calibre_9">I had some good judges in the courtroom and a couple of not-so-good judges. Some judges know the rules of evidence better than others, some judges are so scared of being reversed on appeal that they are paralyzed in their decision making, some judges lean toward the prosecution, and some lean toward the defense. But I never had a judge I thought was openly biased and unfair. Not until I was exposed to the D.C. print media. I could count the reporters who were fair and made an effort at evenhandedness on one hand. That was the headwind in D.C.—not the Democratic opposition but the media opposition, masquerading as fairness and complaining when you called them out.</p><p class="calibre_9">I survived the first term, rafts floating in the Pacific, mice, and all. But the media likes to imprint a narrative and then go in search of the facts to support that narrative. The media’s analysis was no more complicated than this: <span class="italic">Well, he’s from South Carolina, a Republican who beat another Republican in the primary. Therefore he must be a Tea Party guy who dresses up like Samuel Adams on the weekends.</span><a></a> I lost count of the number of times the D.C. media referred to me as a Tea Party congressman or said I was fueled to victory by the Tea Party.</p><p class="calibre_9">The reality, as usual, was different from the media narrative. I do not recall a single Tea Party group endorsing me in the primary <span class="italic">or</span> the general election in 2010. Yes, that is correct: Even in the general election, I did not get the support of the so-called Tea Party organizations. The truth as I lived it was one thing. The narrative as the lazy D.C. print media wanted to write it was another. <span class="italic">Here’s just another Tea Partier in Congress carrying around his pocket copy of the Constitution, talking about the gold standard, and beating up the reasonable Republicans—</span>with “reasonable Republicans” being defined as those who lose, those who die, or those who vote with the Democrats.</p><p class="calibre_9">I don’t care if people are members of the Tea Party or not. Many of my friends were. But I was not. And even when confronted with that truth, the D.C. media continued to write the narrative as they wanted it to be rather than as it was—a trend that would continue unabated for all eight years. One of the challenges of life is to know when something is worth fighting about and when it is not. Not every slight warrants your response. Not every insult requires you to defend yourself. Not every factual inaccuracy requires a press release “setting the record straight.” But when slights, insults, or inaccuracies begin to influence the broader narrative or even begin to challenge or jeopardize your desired closing argument in <a></a>life, you must push back. Candidly you should do that even when you may be the beneficiary of an inaccuracy. Your story, your experience, your life should be just that—yours. It should be fair, accurate, and proportional. When others, due to laziness, negligence, or malice, decide to inaccurately describe you for their own purposes, you should give some serious thought to defending not simply yourself but what is objectively true.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Familiarity Breeds Something</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">My second term was easier because there was a routine and familiarity. Speaker John Boehner asked me to serve on the House Ethics Committee. Actually, he didn’t ask. He told me I was serving on the House Ethics Committee—probably the least coveted committee because it generated no legislation, drew no attention, and was a net-negative fundraising committee. And yet I loved it. It was as close to my old job as Congress would get. There were real investigations, cloaked in confidentiality, and something remarkable happened when we entered the Ethics conference room and began working. The party labels were shed.</p><p class="calibre_9">The committee was equally divided among Republicans and Democrats, so we had to work as a unit, and nearly every vote was unanimous. House Ethics did not investigate allegations of criminality but rather allegations of violations of House rules. Reputations were on the line. Jobs were on the <a></a>line. There were glimmers of fairness behind those closed doors.</p><p class="calibre_9">During my second term, a new investigation appeared on the horizon. On September 11, 2012, four Americans, including our ambassador, were killed in Benghazi, Libya. The State Department launched its own internal investigation, called an Accountability Review Board, and House and Senate congressional committees also began looking into the American presence in Libya, the security profile before the attack, how the administration responded during the attack, and the administration’s handling of the aftermath.</p><p class="calibre_9">As you may recall, the attacks in Benghazi occurred in September 2012, which was less than two months before the 2012 presidential race between President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney. When Speaker Boehner called me to ask me if I would be on the select committee for the investigation, he never mentioned Secretary Clinton’s name or the looming elections. He cited his belief that the Obama administration was not being responsive to congressional requests for information. In particular Speaker Boehner was very displeased that the administration had withheld the so-called Ben Rhodes memo. This was a memo White House official Ben Rhodes authored in the immediate aftermath of the attacks in Benghazi that couched the administration’s response in decidedly political terms. This memo advocated for blaming an anti-Muslim video for the attacks in Benghazi, despite a dearth of evidence to support that theory.</p><p class="calibre_9">That was it. Those were the reasons Boehner gave me: a failure to produce a memo that Boehner found important and a feud between two GOP chairpersons about how to handle the role the military played or did not play in the events that unfolded in Libya. That was 2014. I had been in Congress for three years and was arguably the least well-known member of my historic freshman class. But I was not going to remain unknown for much longer.</p><p class="calibre_9">Benghazi at its core, to me at least, was a homicide investigation. Four people were killed. Why? How? By whom? What preceded the terrorist attack? What could have been done during the attack to limit the losses? Where was the world’s largest and most powerful military for thirteen hours? Did politics impact the manner in which these attacks were discussed and explained in the aftermath? Those were all important questions, which regrettably paled in comparison to the question on the minds of most others, including the media: How did this all relate to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton?</p><p class="calibre_9">That investigation, which spanned two years, proved just how different congressional investigations are from the criminal investigations I had done in South Carolina. There were few tools to access the information needed. Witnesses were hard to find and even harder to compel to cooperate. As it related to the investigation, most people in D.C. fell into one of three groups: (1) Let’s protect Secretary Clinton. (2) Let’s negatively impact Secretary Clinton. (3) Let’s figure out what actually happened in Benghazi and let the chips fall wherever <a></a>they fall. That third group was, frustratingly, not very large.</p><p class="calibre_9">The seeds of my eventual decision to leave Congress were planted, watered, fertilized, and given growth hormones during that investigation. It began as an “investigation” that in theory would mirror closely the work I had done previously. And yet there is nothing similar between congressional investigations and those done by prosecutors who work for the executive branch. There were leaks and rumors. There was daily opposition. We had inadequate access to documents and witnesses. There were groups who wanted to raise money on both sides of the investigation. And the media bemoaned an investigation into a Democratic presidential candidate while they simultaneously made the investigation all about a Democratic presidential candidate. And that was even before her email arrangement became public knowledge.</p><p class="calibre_9">I learned three things during that investigation. First, I learned that the things most members of Congress long for are, in actuality, unfulfilling. Chairmanships. Media attention. Notoriety. Fundraising. All of it was present, and all of it was underwhelming. Second, congressional work is always impacted by the politics. There is no pursuit of the truth in politics. There is a pursuit of the facts that help you electorally, and there is a desire to mitigate, ignore, or keep locked away the facts that do not help you. Third, I relearned an old lesson from my eighth-grade Sunday school teacher. He used to warn me that it was never your enemies who will cause you the most pain in life but those who claim to be your friends. <a></a>Republican chairpersons continued their own Benghazi investigations despite the fact that Speaker Boehner had empaneled a select committee. They even published their own “reports” despite the fact that Boehner had asked the select committee to write the “final dispositive accounting of what happened.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Investigations, as we have seen countless times since Benghazi, are microcosms of the larger political environment. One day a member demands access to all relevant documents and witnesses, and the next day that same member does everything in their power to hide, obfuscate, or minimize access to all relevant documents and witnesses. One day a member votes to hold someone in contempt of Congress for failing to cooperate with a congressional committee, and the next day that same member votes no on almost identical facts due to the identity of the person withholding information. One day a member of Congress bemoans the national debt and deficit, and the next day that same member votes to raise the deficit and debt.</p><p class="calibre_9">We have convinced ourselves that the future of the country depends on who is controlling the House or Senate, and when you convince yourself of that, there are no limits to what you are willing to do to effectuate that control. It is relativism in its purest, and most lethal, form. And there is no referee to officiate it. The voters overlook shortcomings within their own ranks because it is vital that “we” win, whoever “we” are. <a></a>Members, for a season, will bury differences among themselves because it is vital that “they” win and get out of the minority. Once the “majority” is acquired, the internal fighting begins.</p><p class="calibre_9">On the media side, their version of winning is tallied in clicks, subscriptions, mentions, likes, scoops, and influence. The media wins if there is fighting, acrimony, and partisanship. The media wins if there are leaks, even of classified information. Most members of the media are themselves unelectable. So they do the next best thing, which is try to influence who actually is electable.</p><p class="calibre_9">When I was elected to Congress, I foresaw disagreements and battles with the opposing political party. The media headwind was a little unforeseen, but that was largely my fault. The variable I miscalculated the most in those first two terms of Congress was the internecine fighting—the Republican-on-Republican battles and the role conservative media figures, outside of Congress, play in what members of Congress actually do.</p><p class="calibre_9">My first brush with intraparty fighting came early in the second term, as in the <span class="italic">very first</span>
<span class="italic">day</span> of the second term—the day the House votes for Speaker. The race for Speaker was pretty straightforward for me. In November of even-numbered years, shortly after the election, Republicans and Democrats retire to their respective caucus rooms and nominate a candidate for Speaker. It works something like this: Someone announces an intention to be our candidate for Speaker, <a></a>nominating speeches are given, the candidates themselves speak, there is a secret-ballot election, the results are announced, and typically someone will then move to make it unanimous. Pretty simple. In November 2012, John Boehner was the only person who raised his hand and offered to be our candidate for Speaker. Any member of the House could have run, or any member of the House could have nominated someone not in the House to be our candidate. (You do not have to be a member of the House of Representatives to be the Speaker of the House.) It is tantamount to a primary election to determine the Republican nominee for president. Not everyone is happy. Not everyone agrees with the person who got the most votes. But we have a nominee.</p><p class="calibre_9">In January 2013, Boehner was elected Speaker, but there were whispers that it should have been someone else. Twelve Republican members of the House voted for someone other than John Boehner for Speaker, despite the fact that he had been unanimously nominated a few weeks earlier. And of course, these votes for other Speaker candidates were picked up on by parts of the Republican base and amplified by conservative talk show hosts.</p><p class="calibre_9">What sense does it make to have a race in November 2012, have a winner of that race, and then go on the floor of the House and vote for someone other than the nominee who won? All you are doing is airing your family dispute publicly and empowering the minority. If you want to oppose someone, do it when you can actually effectuate change, not when <a></a>you simply gain attention. But it’s not always or even frequently about obtaining a different outcome. It is often simply about fame. It’s about attention. Attention and fundraising go hand in hand, and fame was about to become the ultimate political virtue.</p><p class="calibre_9">It was in my second term (January 2013 to January 2015) that the seeds of what would later become the House Freedom Caucus were sown. In November 2014, Republicans held another intraparty election, this time for what is known as the chairmanship of the Republican Study Committee (RSC). There was interest in chairing the RSC because that group is a significant proving ground for potential legislation and ideas among Republicans and because chairing that group can often lead to other leadership positions in the GOP conference.</p><p class="calibre_9">My South Carolina friend and colleague Mick Mulvaney ran, as did Bill Flores and Louie Gohmert, both from Texas. Obviously, I supported Mick. He was and is a friend who cared deeply about issues and policy and was a hard worker. He campaigned hard, seeking the support of the members of the RSC. He asked me to be his vote counter on the day of the election, and while we thought it would be a close race between him and Flores, it wound up not being very close at all—Mick lost, by a lot. I was disappointed for Mick. There were rumblings that leadership had put its finger on the scales, thinking Flores might be an easier partner to work with than Mick. I have no idea whether this is true or not, but some <a></a>members believed it, and soon thereafter a small group of conservatives began discussing creating a smaller version of the RSC, to be called the House Freedom Caucus.</p><p class="calibre_9">The beginnings of Republican infighting and the Benghazi Select Committee experience solidified how different this new environment was from my previous job as a state prosecutor. In the justice system, the end does not justify the means. Winning is not the only thing that matters. Fairness has a role to play as well. But Congress was different.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you find yourself in an environment you have miscalculated, or the environment has changed, or your definition of success or growth feels next to impossible to achieve, it’s time to leave that place. I am not telling you to avoid trials, difficult assignments, or challenges; all of those can and often do bring about growth. But the chances of you changing the environment, particularly when the environment is large, are not great. When you are honest with yourself about the health of the environment you’re in and the odds you have of effectively changing the environment, you should give serious consideration to leaving where you are, lest it keep you from reaching that final picture you have for yourself.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_18"></div>
