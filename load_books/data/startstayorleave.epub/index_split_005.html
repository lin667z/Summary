A huge part of wisely deciding to start something new is preparation. You want to be prepared for as many scenarios as possible, whether you’re starting a business, toying with the idea of freelancing full-time, popping the question to your significant other, writing a book, or training for a marathon. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best, but take solace in knowing you will be okay even if everything does go south.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Risks and Rewards</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Among the pantheon of idioms, clichés, and old sayings that cannot withstand logical scrutiny, the claim “no risk, no <a></a>reward” sits near the top. The only saying I can think of that has less real-world validity is, “I hate to say I told you so.” In reality, most people cannot wait to tell us they told us so and how right they were. Similarly, you do not have to assume risk in direct proportion to your desired reward. Some risks are just plain stupid. And some of the greatest rewards in life require little to no risk at all.</p><p class="calibre_9">Instead of thinking about risk, my question, as I analyze whether to start something, is: “What is the worst thing that can happen?” If I were to pursue this goal, make this decision, opt for this choice, what is the absolute worst-case scenario?</p><p class="calibre_9">My follow-up question: “Do I have a plan for dealing with the worst if it does happen?”</p><p class="calibre_9">My thinking is that if I have a plan for disaster, it makes everything short of disaster manageable. If I do not have a plan for disaster, if the worst thing I can imagine is beyond my capacity to handle or mitigate, then I likely have no business embarking in this direction.</p><p class="calibre_9">Maybe this guiding question comes from a slight preoccupation with death. Maybe it comes from having a doctor as a father and growing up constantly hearing, “A possible side effect of this medication is to go into anaphylactic shock.” But for me, considering the worst-case scenario is not dwelling on or obsessing over it; it is acknowledging it and coming up with a plan for coping with or mitigating it.</p><p class="calibre_9">It is uncanny how infrequently the worst-case option manifests itself. Rarely in life will you have that anaphylactic <a></a>reaction to your flu vaccine. Rarely in life will you open a store and have zero customers. Rarely in life will the new home you purchase turn out to be the home every single Halloween and Friday the 13th movie was filmed in. Rarely will you leave an old job to take a new one, only to be fired on your first day and left jobless.</p><p class="calibre_9">But even when the worst does happen, if I have properly anticipated it, I can survive. It may result in a subsequent lateral move or, worse yet, a setback, but it is not catastrophic. If it were indeed catastrophic, I would not have made the decision in the first place, because I would have had no plan for the worst. It’s as close to foolproof as we can come with our decision making.</p><p class="calibre_9">I am not a risk taker.</p><p class="calibre_9">Considering my background, I realize this claim seems slightly absurd. When someone goes to college halfway across the country without knowing a single, solitary soul, that is a risk. When someone chooses a career that requires trying to convince twelve strangers to trust the evidence enough to convict another person, that is a risk. When someone runs for two elected offices, that is a risk. When both offices that someone runs for are currently held by entrenched incumbents, that is a risk. When someone makes a living giving live speeches, writing books others can critique and criticize, and appearing with frequency on live television, that is a risk.</p><p class="calibre_9">And since that someone is me, how in the world can I <a></a>consider myself risk-averse? Because the worst thing that could happen to me in any of those scenarios was not so bad that I could not concoct a safety net to survive failure. And once you have a plan for potential calamity, it liberates you to work toward your goal without stress.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">No Such Thing as a Free (Packed) Lunch</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">This worst-case-scenario decision-making paradigm first appeared in my life in the summer of 1982, when I was seventeen years old.</p><p class="calibre_9">I had auditioned for a singing role in the church choir and had been instantly rejected by the minister of music. So much for Christian charity. Not only did I not get a singing role, Mr. Wells decided to expand a non-singing role in the upcoming performance just so I would not be tempted to sing along with the rest of the choir.</p><p class="calibre_9">The role was called “the rebellious boy.” In this church musical, the rebellious boy wore blue jeans with holes in them while everyone else had to be in khakis with monochromatic shirts. The rebel wore a bandana while everyone else had to have perfectly coiffed hair. I even rolled up a fake cigarette and put it behind my ear, until the chaperones saw it and nearly excommunicated me. I already had the wardrobe. It literally required no “acting” at all. But I still had to go to choir practice on Sunday afternoons to prepare for the choir <a></a>tour at First Baptist Spartanburg. Choir tour at my church involved traveling by bus for ten days to two weeks and visiting jails and prisons in different geographic regions of the country.</p><p class="calibre_9">The trip was drawing nigh. We were about a week from departure when one of the chaperones announced that we would need to bring a bagged lunch for the first part of the trip. We would be on a bus headed to Columbia, South Carolina, and then into Georgia and we needed to have a lunch we could eat while traveling. My mom and dad were out of town, so neither one of them would be making that lunch for me. (Actually, it would not have mattered if my father was in town or not. He was not an option for getting a sandwich.) My three sisters would have then (hopefully not now) rather seen me starve to death than make me a sandwich. I was too busy cutting the sleeves out of my shirts and getting fully “in character” to make my own bagged lunch.</p><p class="calibre_9">When they announced we needed a packed lunch, I was standing off to the side in the choir room with some of my buddies, staring at the single most beautiful creation we had ever laid eyes on: a young lady named Terri Elizabeth Dillard. Imagine if Jaclyn Smith from <span class="italic">Charlie’s Angels</span> had an even more beautiful younger sister. Now add the most radiant smile you have ever seen in your life and couple that with an effervescent personality. You have Terri Dillard! We were all staring at her, which we did quite frequently. She, on the <a></a>other hand, had never noticed a single one of us. Ever.</p><p class="calibre_9">“I think I am going to ask Terri Dillard to make my lunch for me,” I said.</p><p class="calibre_9">My friends burst into laughter. “She doesn’t know you are alive! Plus, girls that look like her don’t make lunches, not for guys like you!”</p><p class="calibre_9">“What’s the worst thing that can happen?” was my response. I kept repeating it to myself. The worst thing that can happen is she says no. But she’s supposed to be a Christian, so it would have to be a somewhat nice “no,” wouldn’t it? We are at church, so even if she says “no,” it would be a quiet “no,” probably followed by some lame excuse, as opposed to just a flat “no, not now and not ever.”</p><p class="calibre_9">The worst thing that can happen when a seventeen-year-old asks Helen of Troy to make a sack lunch for him is not that bad. She says no. You endure a little ribbing from your friends. You avoid eye contact with her for the rest of your natural life. That’s it. That was the analysis I employed. The worst thing that can happen is she smiles and says she can’t do it.</p><p class="calibre_9">If she does say no, I have the fallback of getting one of my friends’ moms to help me out. Plus, my friends will know I am not afraid of anything. If you can walk up to Terri Dillard, who has never noticed you a day in your life, and make a lunch request, you literally can do anything in the world.</p><p class="calibre_9">Thus was born the decision-making paradigm that has sustained me ever since. Map out the possible outcomes. Assign <a></a>some probability to those outcomes. Imagine the single worst outcome, construct a plan to survive that, and you have a functioning decision-making model.</p><p class="calibre_9">As fate would have it, she said, “Sure, I’d be happy to. And I’m so sorry your parents are out of town. That must be so hard for you.” Or some other angelic response that normal people don’t make. Thirty-nine years later Terri still will make a lunch for me if I ask nicely, although, thank the Lord, my mom doesn’t travel as much as she did back then, so she is still a viable option. And do you believe in miracles? Now I can make my own lunch, sort of.</p><p class="calibre_9">The risk of private humiliation among a group of seventeen-year-old boys at church seems pale when compared to the reward of thirty-two years of marriage to Terri Dillard. The reward exponentially outpaced any perceived risk I could identify.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Find Your Mantra</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">“What’s the worst that can happen?” Depending on the tone with which it is said, it may sound more devil-may-care than what it really is, which is an acknowledgment of fear and a desire for security. Will this decision endanger the security of me or my family? Can I recover from failure if I pursue this? What are the potential financial consequences? Have I thought through every possible result from this decision and created a backup plan for if I fail? And by “thought through,” I do not mean that you’ve passingly considered whatever immediately <a></a>entered your mind. I mean that you’ve actively anticipated and carefully reviewed all possible consequences and attempted to develop a plan to meet those consequences.</p><p class="calibre_9">As you continue to rationally work through your decision on whether or not to start something new, I encourage you to have a decision-making mantra, a go-to phrase, a paradigm, a model that prepares you to go into and through the decision-making process with peace and wisdom. If you’re a cynic, like me, this worst-case paradigm might work well for you. Another good one is: “Do not go through life saying what you wished you had done.” It’s simple. It’s profound.</p><p class="calibre_9">“What are you afraid of?” That’s another paradigm some people employ to make decisions. It is certainly more of a liberal arts approach than a scientific or mathematical one. Fear is hard to quantify. But that does not mean we cannot wrestle with it and tame it to some degree. Use your mind and assign some probabilities to what you fear. Don’t merely wait on “finding peace” to go for something, because peace can be an infrequent visitor. And we do not always recognize peace when it does make an appearance.</p><p class="calibre_9">Perhaps it is the lawyer in me, but waiting until you are “certain” is going to be a long wait as well. Certitude as defined how? One hundred percent sure? Beyond a reasonable doubt? We hear the word “certain” and its first cousin, “sure,” a lot. “Are you certain?” “Are you sure?” The standard for decision making in the courtroom, when it comes to taking <a></a>people’s liberty, reputation, resources, and even their life, is not “certainty.” It is “beyond a reasonable doubt.” Judges even remind juries that it is impossible to prove or know anything with total certainty. So “beyond a reasonable doubt” or “firmly convinced” is sufficient for criminal court. If “firmly convinced” is good enough for capital murder trials, it should probably be good enough for that decision to start a master’s program in business or launch that interior design firm dream you’ve always had.</p><p class="calibre_9">Other decision-making mantras include:</p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Everything happens for a reason.”</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Does it really matter in the grand scheme of things?”</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Flip a coin.”</blockquote></li><li value="4" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Go big or go home.”</blockquote></li><li value="5" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Clear eyes, full hearts, can’t lose.”</blockquote></li><li value="6" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Hey, watch this!” (This is the decision-making paradigm most of my college fraternity brothers used.)</blockquote></li></ul><p class="calibre_9">None of these have been as effective for me as reasoning through the worst-case scenario. Some of these models for making decisions may catapult you into an existential crisis so that the decision never gets made (which is in and of itself a decision of sorts). Others may unwittingly set the default <a></a>answer for all of your decisions or choices in life to yes or no. Whatever first-step paradigm you develop must be consistent with who you are, which means you have to know yourself before you choose your mantra.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Sunday Drive</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Starting something new often puts you in a pretty vulnerable position. You’ve probably gotten comfortable where you are, you know what to expect, and you’ve built a somewhat predictable rhythm for your life. There is peace in familiarity. There is security in what is known. When you start something new, all of that changes—what was once steady, stable, and comfortable becomes irregular, uncertain, and challenging. Most of us have a natural predisposition toward comfort, so if we are merely cruising through life with no map and no direction, we will probably remain comfortable—though perhaps never be fulfilled.</p><p class="calibre_9">Comfort calls to mind the Sunday afternoon drivers I used to get behind on the road. Perhaps you have been behind them too. They were always, for me, an older couple who drove well below the speed limit and actually reacted to yellow lights before they turned red. Even when the dadgum light is green, they are slowing down in anticipation of it changing to yellow! They are headed nowhere, slowly. They are comfortable just riding around.</p><p class="calibre_9">But it’s not just older folks on their Sunday afternoon <a></a>drives. We can all get that way in relationships, jobs, and locations. Things are known, and therefore they are comfortable. And we stop striving and start merely settling.</p><p class="calibre_9">Starting something new, trying something different, changing what is comfortable and familiar is looking past the short-term beckoning of the status quo, way on down the road—passing signs warning of uncertainty, unevenness, sharp curves, and road closures—and seeing the end scene you want. That’s where you are headed.</p><p class="calibre_9">You can prepare for the journey that awaits you. You can foresee as many possible outcomes as your mind can conjure—so that you can start this something new with confidence. There will always be unknowns and risks, but through preparation, we can logically assess those risks as we continue to let our dreams pull us forward into that future we desire and aspire to. My decision-making mantra—“What’s the worst that can happen?”—is a thought experiment that doesn’t shy away from risk; it invites risk into the decision and even befriends it. Rather than going into new endeavors blindly, with sheer enthusiasm leading the way, I ensure that enthusiasm and caution work in tandem to lead me more safely to that dream or goal. Acknowledge and assess risk, then consider how you can soften the consequences if the worst were to happen. This preparation will give you the confidence you need to start something new.</p><p class="calibre_9">Sometimes the very worst thing that could happen is not pursuing the opportunity presented to us. Sometimes we let <a></a>comfort win, when we really should have taken the risk. Dreams, goals, and aspirations are powerful forces in our lives, and if we don’t listen to them and nurture them and have confidence in their ability to lead us—with logic in tow, of course—then we may very well miss out on all that life has to offer us. Choosing to play it safe in every decision we make could lead to a comfortable life, but it will ignore and belittle the parts of ourselves that make us come alive, which are our passions and aspirations.</p><p class="calibre_9">I doubt you want the dominant refrain at your retirement party or wake to be: “Gosh, he sure did lead a comfortable, risk-averse, and largely boring life,” or, “She was the best I have ever seen at settling for things and never striving or taking a risk.” To start something new is to take a risk. Period. Embrace it. Analyze it. Confront it. With enthusiasm and caution as your guides, you can sit back and enjoy the ride, bumps and all.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_6"></div>
