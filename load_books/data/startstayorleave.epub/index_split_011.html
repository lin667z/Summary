When we have clear and unshakable priorities, we can put every other part of a decision—those aspirations pulling us, the pros and cons, the risks and consequences—into perspective. Priorities shape which areas of our lives we focus on building and encourage us to stay put even when something new and shiny is calling our name.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Sometimes, It’s Better to Delay Takeoff</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Often, I’ve found, the most dangerous dreams are the ones that consume us with their relative possibility and cause us to take unnecessary and unwise risks. We try to force our dreams into happening, ignoring certain facts and pushing aside our priorities to make room for our singular pursuit. When our priorities and dreams challenge one another, when they are seemingly incongruent or in potential conflict, we should <a></a>proceed in our decisions with extreme caution. I’ve pursued a myopic, single-minded goal before, and I almost lost a lot in the process.</p><p class="calibre_9">I was a year removed from law school and clerking for United States District Court Judge G. Ross Anderson, Jr., when I realized exactly what I wanted to be: a federal prosecutor at the United States Attorney’s Office. Openings in the U.S. Attorney’s Office were rare, but they did occur. Nothing materialized for me during my first year clerking for Judge Anderson. Anytime there was an opening, someone with more experience and better connections was hired, but I persisted. Those doing the hiring at the U.S. Attorney’s Office wanted experienced trial lawyers, and I could not blink my eyes and suddenly become more experienced.</p><p class="calibre_9">The reason I sympathize with young people who face job postings looking for “experience” is because I heard it and lived it so much myself. While I could not expedite my experience, I could most assuredly work on my connections. I met with federal judges and with influential lawyers who might put in a good word for me with the decision makers in the relevant federal offices. I made it clear I would be willing to move anywhere in South Carolina if there was an opening.</p><p class="calibre_9">After some time with no forward movement, I decided to expand the map even more. I wrote to U.S. Attorneys’ Offices throughout the country asking to be considered for any openings they may have. This was not something I did lightly. <a></a>My wife, Terri, was born in our hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina. She went to Converse College in Spartanburg. My parents lived there. Her parents lived there. We both had been members of the same church for our entire lives. Spartanburg was the only home either of us had ever known. It was where we wanted to raise the child we had at the time and any others who might come along. And yet I was willing to leave all of that for this single-minded dream of being a federal prosecutor—no matter what.</p><p class="calibre_9">I remember one night around the holidays in 1993 when I was furiously addressing envelopes to send my résumé to U.S. Attorneys’ Offices all around the country. My wife was at the stove, using the heat to ensure that the glitter stuck to the custom Christmas cards she was making for our friends and family. I remember her being happy and me being in the miserable throes of a lengthy crusade mass mailing résumés to U.S. attorneys I would never meet.</p><p class="calibre_9">But, at last, I got a response! The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado wrote me back and scheduled a phone interview. The phone interview went well, and they asked me to fly to Denver for an in-person interview with the chief of the criminal division. Things were looking promising! I just needed to do well during the in-person interview.</p><p class="calibre_9">I was never closer to realizing my dream of becoming a federal prosecutor than I was when sitting at the gate waiting for the flight to Denver to board. Unfortunately, or fortunately, I had time. Too much time. While sitting at my gate, I <a></a>leaned my head back on the chair and stared at the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">What are you doing? Are you really going to take a job in a state you have no connections with? Are you going to move Terri away from everything and everyone she has ever known and loved? Are you going to tell your mom that she has to come to Colorado to see her grandchildren? You are trying to force this goal of yours into reality.</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">If you do get the job and accept it, everything may be new and exciting for a season, but then what? Is the work alone enough to make up for everything else you are forgoing and leaving? Is it fair to uproot everything so you can say you did what you always wanted to do? Why are you judging yourself based on the one thing you don’t have while ignoring all of what you do have?</span></p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">Count your other blessings. This dream is not worth the price it would exact from those you claim to care about. It is time to either recalibrate success, find another dream, or learn the art of patience. But this is over.</span></p><p class="calibre_9">So I stood up. Gathering my briefcase, I walked back to my car. I drove home. I called the office number for the person I was scheduled to meet with and left a voicemail thanking him for giving me the chance to interview but explained that moving to Colorado was not an option for me at this point. (Yes, I felt like an idiot for saying that, because the job had always been in Colorado. It was there when I applied. It was there when I did the phone interview. And it was there when I scheduled my flight.)</p><p class="calibre_9">When I returned home, I tried to quietly change clothes <a></a>and get in bed. But my wife, who sleeps like a Special Forces sniper with a diet of Red Bulls, woke up and asked, “What happened?”</p><p class="calibre_9">“I can’t do it, baby. I just can’t do it. This is home. I can’t leave our home.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Because life has a sense of humor, the person I was scheduled to interview with in Denver wound up becoming a friend and a colleague later in life. He doesn’t fully recall receiving a late-night phone call from a job applicant who finally understood that a job with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colorado meant actually moving to Colorado.</p><p class="calibre_9">I remember it with brilliant vividness, because it was the night I learned a very important lesson about the power of staying where you are: Rushing your aspirations, hurrying your goals, and forcing your dreams into fruition comes with consequences that could very well put life’s other priorities in real jeopardy.</p><p class="calibre_9">I’ve seen people buy houses even though it wasn’t the best financial move because they had a dream to be a homeowner. I have seen people buy homes they could not afford because it was their “dream” house. I’ve seen people force relationships because the idea of the relationship took priority over the realities of a lifetime promise and commitment. I’ve seen couples have children very early in a relationship only to then realize that, along with the impossible cuteness, from time to time comes some crying and sleepless nights.</p><p class="calibre_9">How can you tell when you are forcing something? How <a></a>do you know when to simply stay put?</p><p class="calibre_9">Sometimes introspection and soul-searching are necessary to determine if you are allowing your stubbornness to overrule logic and your dream has become an outsized priority. Ask yourself: What is the deeper desire behind the surface-level goal you crave? Love? Security? A certain image? Does securing that thing matter more than—take priority over—your financial, relational, or emotional stability? Does prioritizing your dream set you up for more success in the long run, or does it risk everything you’ve worked hard to achieve so far?</p><p class="calibre_9">When you are making a decision and factoring in your priorities, looking around you and counting your blessings is a helpful tool. If you count your blessings and you know they are stronger and more valuable than the dream alone, it’s time to stay.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Compatibility Tests</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">I often replay the decision to not take that second interview and think through what the consequences would have been if I’d taken that job in Colorado. My kids wouldn’t be as close to their grandparents, I would have spent thousands of dollars on plane fares to go back to my beloved home state as often as I had the chance to, and my wife and I would not be as close to the friends who have become like family to us.</p><p class="calibre_9">Some call this dwelling in the past or Monday-morning quarterbacking. I call it wisdom: the wisdom of learning <a></a>without pain being the teacher. Sure, the embarrassing phone call in which I seemed geographically challenged was painful to make, but it pales in comparison to the pain of pursuing my dream at the expense of my wife and the life we have in our beloved hometown. I preferred calling a stranger and backing out of an interview over calling my mother and telling her that her grandchild was moving to Colorado.</p><p class="calibre_9">Decisions almost always involve sacrificing one thing for another. Each option includes something you’ll have to give up. If I had taken the federal prosecutor job in Colorado, it would’ve meant sacrificing my dream of being close to family and raising my kids in my home state of South Carolina. By not taking it, I sacrificed the opportunity to have my dream job at that moment in time.</p><p class="calibre_9">I eventually did become a federal prosecutor, just a couple of years later and in my home state of South Carolina. It was a circuitous path that involved more letter writing, more favors from colleagues, and more patience than I was initially prepared to demonstrate. But I am beyond grateful that I took the longer path and that I stayed where I was rather than taking the job in Colorado. Staying kept my priorities and plans intact while only momentarily delaying one of my dreams.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you get stuck among several great options, it’s important to take a good, hard look at your priorities. Consider every area of your life: relational, professional, educational, personal, spiritual, physical, emotional. How will the decision <a></a>to start, stay, or leave affect the health of any of these areas of your life? What area of your life is most important to you? Is your relational health with your family and friends your top priority? Is your professional growth number one?</p><p class="calibre_9">In different seasons, you’ll find that your priorities shift, and that’s okay. But by focusing on one positive to the exclusion of any negatives, you weight your life too heavily in one direction. Make sure you’re not sacrificing too much well-being in one area to achieve something in another, especially if it’s only for a fleeting season. Sacrifice is inherent in decisions, so consider areas you are willing to sacrifice in and areas where you would not want to compromise.</p><p class="calibre_9">Even if a dream is attainable, even if starting something new is within the realm of possibility for you, it does not mean you should pursue it full force or immediately. You might be wondering, “Why not go after all my dreams if my definition of success centers on trying rather than achieving?” And the answer is: because your dreams are often in conflict with one another. You likely cannot go after all your dreams at once because that would be either impossible or unhealthy. You usually have to choose.</p><p class="calibre_9">Think about the consequences of pursuing a dream, not only for yourself and your loved ones but also for your other dreams, plans, and priorities. If you dream of becoming a world-renowned surgeon and you also want to open a bakery, those dreams will probably conflict. It doesn’t mean you can’t <a></a>achieve both, it just means you probably can’t pursue both at the same time. If you dream of doing a solo trip around the world and you dream of getting married, those dreams conflict; you can’t pursue them concurrently.</p><p class="calibre_9">Dreams, especially attainable ones, can sometimes distort our priorities. When weighing the decision to stay where you are or leave and start something new, take a hard look at your priorities. Which dreams are at the forefront of your picture of the end, and which are in the background? Which dreams need to happen now as opposed to later on? What are the windows of opportunity? Which of your dreams can you pursue concurrently? Which dreams conflict?</p><p class="calibre_9">When I was at that airport waiting for the flight to Denver, I realized that even though it didn’t seem likely at the time, another opportunity to become a federal prosecutor would probably arise. If we moved across the country, however, we’d never be able to get back the years we spent away from family.</p><p class="calibre_9">To prioritize fairly when making decisions, consider the following:</p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Others.</span></span> How would the decision to leave impact others? What would be the benefits and consequences for them? Are you merely imagining those benefits or consequences, or have you discussed them with the impacted persons?</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Opportunities.</span></span> Is this truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity toward your closing argument, or will there be other opportunities in the future, perhaps at better times or under better circumstances? Do your means and motivations align with this dream?</blockquote></li><a></a><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Goals.</span></span> Does this dream align with your closing argument? Does this align with your definition of success?</blockquote></li><li value="4" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Risks.</span></span> What risks are involved in this decision? Are there ways to mitigate those risks? Do the risks only affect you or do they impact others?</blockquote></li><li value="5" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Sacrifices.</span></span> What opportunities are you sacrificing if you pursue this dream at this time? By saying yes to this, what are you saying no to? As a general rule of thumb, the longer the period of commitment, the more you should weigh and balance this factor. Military, contractual, and other obligations carry hard-and-fast time commitments from which it is hard to extricate yourself. Have you considered fully how the decision feels not just in the here and now but even midway through your period of commitment?</blockquote></li><li value="6" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Costs.</span></span> What will this dream cost you in terms of money, time, and effort? Is it worth the cost to you?</blockquote></li></ul><p class="calibre_9">At your current inflection point, or as you approach the next one, think through the options you have and gather the facts about those options, using this list. Be aware that our <a></a>dreams can cause blind spots in our lives. We become emotionally connected to pursuing one dream and, in doing so, we compromise others that may, upon cool reflection, actually benefit us more. We are human and these are decisions that affect us personally; there is absolutely no way we can be 100 percent objective. Our desires, emotions, and fears seep into every decision we make, and that’s not a bad thing. But we need to be aware of them. Gathering the facts will help you see the decision from all angles and, in doing so, you’ll see the whole picture, flaws and all, so you can pave more roads rather than chase dead ends.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Stay True to Yourself</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">One of the people my wife and I love the very most in all of life is Mary-Langston Willis Don. We worked together toward the end of my time in Washington. She was what in D.C. is called a scheduler. Being a scheduler is more than simply filling up the calendar. It is managing the most precious commodity any of us has, which is our time. Schedulers manage the calendars for members of Congress both in their home districts and in D.C. They greet and interact with visitors, they plan all travel, they make sure we get to votes and committee hearings, and they have a close connection with the spouse and family of the member so that time is allotted for family matters as well. Early on in my congressional career, my longtime friend and colleague Tom Graves from Georgia <a></a>said this about schedulers: “Their job is to make sure you don’t want to quit yours.” I grew to fully understand what Tom meant by that.</p><p class="calibre_9">Positions like chief of staff, communications director, and legislative director sound impressive, and they are. But schedulers spend more time with the member of Congress than anyone else on the team. They are there for the worst days. They are the ones you call when the calendar changes at the last minute or you have a crisis and need to take a later flight. Being a scheduler is the hardest and often most thankless job in any congressional office.</p><p class="calibre_9">Once Mary-Langston graduated from college and arrived in D.C., she remained my scheduler despite untold opportunities to leave. It was quite the baptism by fire scheduling for a member on multiple committees who liked being on the first airplane out of D.C. and the last airplane back to D.C.</p><p class="calibre_9">I was on the Intelligence Committee, which was interviewing witnesses by the dozens; on the Ethics Committee, which had very lengthy meetings; on the Judiciary Committee, which is also very time-consuming; and in the throes of another serious investigation. And when the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, then Utah congressman Jason Chaffetz, decided to leave Congress, I was asked to finish out his term and chair that committee too. There were days when my commitments were impossible to navigate successfully: different committees meeting at the same time, different colleagues needing help with their various initiatives. I <a></a>found myself in my office saying to a twenty-two-year-old, “You gotta help me clear some of these obligations off the calendar! This is overwhelming! Yes, I committed to all of them. Yes, I need to do them all. Yes, I am old enough to be your father and should not be so overwhelmed by all of this, but you are going to have to get me out of some of what I have gotten myself into.” Imagine that, an old man who prosecuted murder cases and participated in contentious congressional hearings hiding behind someone his children’s age and asking her to bail him out of the things he overcommitted to doing.</p><p class="calibre_9">After she started I found that I only had to ask her to do things once and then I didn’t have to ask at all. After a couple of months, she could look at the calendar and begin to make changes herself. She did what the best schedulers do, which is make sure their member of Congress is not overcommitted and exhausted. She literally ran my professional life for me. Always pleasant, always professional, and mature way beyond her years.</p><p class="calibre_9">In November 2018, two months before I would finish serving my last term in Congress, I was driving home from the airport in Charlotte when Mary-Langston called. She rarely called. Hers is the texting generation, so a call from her meant it was important. She had received a job offer. She had been asked to go work for the president of a very well-regarded university in a capacity much like the one she had in Washington. I knew the person who offered her the job. He is the <a></a>kind of person you would want your daughter (or someone like a daughter) to go work for. I also knew Mary-Langston had received offers from other members of Congress to stay in D.C. She had received offers from people in the executive branch. To meet her is to know there is something different about her, and I was not at all surprised that she had a string of opportunities. But I was surprised at my reaction to those offers. Reality finally hit me that when I left D.C. for good, she would move on to another job. This young person I had grown so reliant on would not be part of my daily life anymore.</p><p class="calibre_9">As she was describing the job she was offered, I reflected on the day John Ratcliffe and I took her to lunch in Washington to offer her what we believed to be some fatherly counsel about her career ambitions. Everyone in Washington seems to want to be or do something they are not currently being or doing. House members want to be senators. Senators want to be presidents. Schedulers want to be legislative directors. So Ratcliffe and I, as two old, seasoned, and grizzled investigators, decided to find out what Mary-Langston wanted most out of life so we could help her get it. Being a scheduler is no one’s ideal job.</p><p class="calibre_9">We began the conversation by asking her about what her dream job would be. “I just really like helping people, and I want to work with people I respect. That’s about it,” was her response. John and I looked at each other and thought, <span class="italic">What is wrong with her? All she wants to do is help people? Who ever heard of that?</span><a></a> We kept pushing, and she kept trying to change the conversation because she doesn’t like talking about herself. Plus she was probably thinking, <span class="italic">Why would I take career advice from two old men in the world’s least popular line of work?</span> She doesn’t care about money or fame or attention. It’s this authentic, faith-driven desire to help people. After a solid hour of trying to “help” Mary-Langston with her career, John and I gave up. She truly is different, and Ratcliffe and I needed to end that lunch before her kindness and goodness rubbed off on us.</p><p class="calibre_9">That was my only attempt at giving Mary-Langston unsolicited career advice. But now I found myself being asked for direction. “What should I do, Trey? It’s so nice that he thought of me, and it would be a wonderful job.”</p><p class="calibre_9">I couldn’t say anything for a second because I was on the verge of tears. This young person who had become like a member of the family was being offered a job that would take her out of my daily life, which is where she had been for years. That was terrible for me. But maybe not for her. I blinked back some tears and said, “Mary-Langston, you should go interview for that job. He’s a wonderful man. It’s an amazing school. And it’s too good of an opportunity to pass up. I’m going to practice law, and you are not a legal secretary. You should go interview for that job, and when it’s offered, you should take it.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Thank God she did not listen to one bit of my advice.</p><p class="calibre_9">She stayed with me once we got back to South Carolina. I <a></a>don’t think she even took the interview. Mary-Langston decided that staying with her then employer would enable her to live her life’s purpose, which is to help other people. She has helped me with every facet of life after Congress, from TV to speeches to teaching college classes. But along the way she found her life’s passion by starting an after-school program for young girls in Greenville. She is doing exactly what she always wanted to do: help other people. She was right. Ratcliffe and I were wrong. There really are people in life who simply derive joy from helping those in need, and she managed to do that by staying right where she was, in her hometown, with her former boss. And a brand-new horizon opened in an old and familiar setting.</p><p class="calibre_9">Mary-Langston’s decision helped me see the power our priorities play in getting closer to our desired closing argument. She knew, even at her age, what she valued most, and she filtered her other decisions through those values. She may not have had everything mapped out, but her values kept her grounded and headed in the direction of her chosen closing argument.</p><p class="calibre_9">Maybe you do not yet have a crystal clear path or a fully developed dream. Maybe your priorities take the shape of characteristics, like service or integrity or humility. And while those priorities may not seem as tangible as the priority of, say, working for a particular company or starting a family in your home state, they are equally compelling guides as you find yourself at a crossroads. What decision will allow you to <a></a>live a life of service to those in need? What decision will enable you to live the most consequential and honest life? When you find yourself looking at two or more great options, keep your most valued characteristics in your mind as you contemplate your decision. Being firmly convinced of those unshakable priorities upon which you want to build your life and reputation will help you clarify your end picture and make sure that you are on the right track.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_12"></div>
