When weighing the risks and rewards, pros and cons, passions and obligations, we often discover that there is a dream, a hope, a goal, an aspiration pulling us in some direction despite what others might consider a more prudent course. It has happened to me, and I am glad I did not listen to the voices of “prudence,” even when one of the voices was my own.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Dream Job</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">From 1994 to 2000, I had what was my ideal—my dream—job: I was a federal prosecutor. The more proper name is assistant United States attorney. There is really no professional feeling in the world that can equate with standing in front of a judge or jury and saying, “I am here on behalf of the United States of America.” I was never tempted to have a personalized <a></a>license tag when I was in Congress (for many reasons, including the fact that I did not want to be run off the road by those who did not like my votes). I didn’t even have a personalized license tag when I was the circuit solicitor. But by golly I wanted one when I was a federal prosecutor. It was not so much that I wanted others to know what I did for a living but rather that I wanted the daily reminder for myself that I finally had my dream job. It was everything I thought I wanted in a career: challenging work, a laudatory purpose for that work, and the best client anyone could ever have—my fellow citizens.</p><p class="calibre_9">A United States Supreme Court justice had this to say about the role of federal prosecutors:</p><blockquote class="calibre_6">The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereign whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor—indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a <a></a>wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.<sup class="calibre6"><small id="filepos123240" class="calibre7"><a href="#filepos153723"><span class="calibre8"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">[*]</span></span></span></a></small></sup></blockquote><p class="calibre_9">I believed every word of that and there was a feeling of purpose I had earlier on in my career as a federal prosecutor that was unrivaled by any other professional feeling I have ever had.</p><p class="calibre_9">The only thing that surpassed the feeling was the satisfaction of the work itself. On a daily basis, federal prosecutors get to meet with agents from all spheres of law enforcement. They meet with victims and offer some hope that justice may be drawing near. They match wits with talented defense attorneys. They strive to persuade juries by the highest evidentiary burden known to law, beyond a reasonable doubt. They get questioned by trial judges and then later by appellate judges. The legal issues are challenging, and the stakes are as high as you can imagine when freedom and justice are involved. And that word, “justice,” was not merely a word or an aspiration. It was the daily goal. The job of a federal prosecutor is not merely to win, it is to be a minister of justice, as the Supreme Court said. I don’t know that I have ever been prouder to tell people what I did for a living than when I was a federal prosecutor.</p><p class="calibre_9">And I think most people who worked with me—certainly my colleagues in law enforcement and at the U.S. Attorney’s Office—would tell you I did a pretty good job while I was there. I handled hundreds of indictments and grand jury investigations. I tried or co-tried almost fifty cases in less than six years. I tried three cases in one week, which is almost unheard of. There were bank robberies, carjackings, child pornography cases, and even the murder of federal witness Ricky Samuel. Those cases felt important, like I was fulfilling my dreams and helping keep my community safe: prosecuting crimes that victimize people.</p><p class="calibre_9">But, like many other jobs, the reality did not fully align with the aspiration. Actually realizing a dream can sometimes be more mundane than anticipating one. Being a federal prosecutor, as good as it was, still wasn’t exactly what I expected or wanted. What started off as new and exciting became, over the course of time, rote. Well over half of my cases were firearms and narcotics cases. The firearms cases usually involved the possession of a firearm by someone who could not legally have it, but often the gun had not actually been used in the commission of a crime, rather simply possessed. And the drug cases were primarily economic crimes, people selling narcotics, which was similar, to me at least, to how others might embezzle money, rob banks, kite checks, or steal automobiles. None of the defendants I prosecuted were convicted of—or even accused of—selling narcotics to young people or children.</p><p class="calibre_9">After you have done ten narcotics cases, they get monotonous. The legal issues are the same, the witness challenges are the same, and the results are almost always the same: A young man goes to the Federal Bureau of Prisons for some portion of his life while drugs remain every bit as readily available—and in some instances just as cheap—as they were before you tried the case. People have different perspectives on narcotics prosecutions, and I respect those different positions. In my experience, the primary result for a narcotics case was a lengthy period of incarceration for a crime in which no one was killed, assaulted, or otherwise physically harmed—although, of course, the people using the narcotics may well have been harmed by consuming them. But there are also plenty of lawful substances that are not healthy for you either.</p><p class="calibre_9">On the other hand, I also prosecuted people for possession of child pornography, which exploits children in horrific ways. Yet those defendants received shorter prison sentences than people who possessed cocaine base with the intent to distribute. As noted above, five grams of cocaine base equaled a mandatory minimum of five years in federal prison, even if the defendant accepted responsibility and pleaded guilty. That mandatory sentence is one year longer than the sentence of a defendant I prosecuted who was convicted of possessing child pornography. After seeing the images of those young children in that child pornography trial and witnessing the jury’s physical revulsion and anger, the disproportionality in sentencing between crimes that do shocking harm and those rooted in <a></a>poverty and perceived economic necessity began to unsettle me. I began to ask myself, as you may too at some point on your journey, whether this was still my dream job.</p><p class="calibre_9">That lack of proportionality struck me most powerfully in the parking lot of the United States District Courthouse in Anderson, South Carolina. I had just finished a drug trial, and the defendant was convicted and would be sentenced to life without the possibility of parole for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine. The defendant was a major drug dealer with a lengthy criminal history. I felt no sympathy for him whatsoever. But I could not shake the issue of proportionality from my mind. As I walked to my truck, my mind went back to one of the very first cases I had any involvement with in the federal system. My role was insignificant at best, but the facts of the case will stay with me for the rest of my life.</p><p class="calibre_9">I had been at the United States Attorney’s Office for only a few months when a woman claimed that, while she was stopped at a red light in a rural part of Union County in South Carolina, an African American man forced her from her car and drove off with it, her two small sons still inside. It was the kind of crime most of us fear the most: stranger crime with the lives of children in the balance. The carjacking and kidnapping allegations meant this could have federal jurisdiction, since both kidnapping and carjacking could be federal crimes.</p><p class="calibre_9">Early on in the investigation, the local Union County law <a></a>enforcement agents I was talking to were suspicious of the carjacking and kidnapping allegations. Taking a car is one thing. That’s for money. Taking a car that has two small children in it is much more unusual. There had been no ransom request. No calls from the alleged kidnapper. No children left at a gas station or along the road. But the job of law enforcement is to run down all leads, even the ones that seem far-fetched and impractical. They investigated every possibility.</p><p class="calibre_9">And those local cops were right.</p><p class="calibre_9">There was no carjacking.</p><p class="calibre_9">There was no kidnapping.</p><p class="calibre_9">There was no African American man at a stoplight.</p><p class="calibre_9">There was a mother, Susan Smith, who strapped her two sons in the back of her car and let that car roll into John D. Long Lake.</p><p class="calibre_9">Terri and I had a young son when Susan Smith murdered her two young sons. In fact, our son turned two years old the day she strapped those two little boys in a car and let that car roll into a lake. For most people, there is nothing we would not do to save a child. We would risk drowning, risk burning, risk anything for any child. The desire to protect would be even higher if it were your own child. Most parents never move faster than when one of their children is headed toward potential peril.</p><p class="calibre_9">Contrast that with the decisions Susan Smith made. I wondered about the sound of the angelic cooing and babbling of young children in the car while she drove them to what she <a></a>knew would be their death. I wondered how many times the word “Mommy” may have been uttered by one of those children on the car ride to the boat ramp. I wondered if she had second thoughts as she was positioning the car on the ramp leading down to the water’s edge. How she made the decision to actually get out of the car while leaving those two children strapped in their car seats. Whether she heard the sounds of her children wondering why Mommy was getting out of the car, why the car was moving into the water, where Mommy was.</p><p class="calibre_9">She was on the boat ramp watching her two sons drown. That’s where she was.</p><p class="calibre_9">And for more than a week, she let a nation grieve and suffer with her. For more than a week, she led the nation to believe she was a victim, when in reality she was the monster.</p><p class="calibre_9">There were no federal carjacking or kidnapping charges because there was no carjacking or kidnapping at all. This was capital murder. This was a case that would be tried in South Carolina state court by a man who wound up becoming a colleague and a dear friend, then solicitor Tommy Pope.</p><p class="calibre_9">That case is always near the surface of my mind, because even after the passage of nearly thirty years, the depravity is still numbing. But it rose to the forefront of my mind as I walked to my truck in the parking lot of the federal courthouse in Anderson, South Carolina. The man who would be sentenced for these drug charges would serve the remainder of his life in federal prison, without the possibility of parole. Meanwhile, Susan Smith was sentenced to life in prison <span class="italic">with</span>
<a></a>the possibility of parole after thirty years. Susan Smith will be eligible for parole one day—despite murdering her own sons. That is not proportional. That is not right. That is not just.</p><p class="calibre_9">While I had what I thought was my dream job—federal prosecutor—the work had begun to feel less purposeful. I began to wonder if it was possible to still be a prosecutor but handle different kinds of cases, cases where the sentence seemed more proportional to the crime, like homicides, sexual assaults, burglaries, and armed robberies. The answer was yes—that is what state court prosecutors do every day.</p><p class="calibre_9">The position of district attorney, or circuit solicitor as they’re called in South Carolina, is an elected one wherein the prosecutor represents the state in criminal matters. Being a federal prosecutor is like being a neurosurgeon with a particular expertise in one part of the brain, but being a state prosecutor is like being an emergency room physician on a weekend night in New York City. Both are essential and rewarding, but the variety and the scope is much larger in the state criminal justice system. I wanted to go to that venue where crimes that victimize people, crimes that shock the conscience of a community, are prosecuted.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Gather the Facts</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Once I acknowledged that my dream had changed and I was interested in a slightly different career path, I had a decision to make. I sat at the crossroads between an old dream and a <a></a>new one, and thus, the conversation began. Do I leave the United States Attorney’s Office after nearly six years and start a new path as a state prosecutor, or do I stay with what is familiar and comfortable, even if not always exhilarating? I needed to know all the facts before diving in. So, I did what I am asking you to do: I gathered the facts, and I wrote out the pros and cons based on the facts.</p><p class="calibre_9">We have all been encouraged to balance pros and cons. That is not hard. But how do you order, structure, and categorize those facts? How do you know which side of the scale to position them on and what weight they hold? All facts are not equal. It is a fact that I like Mercedes-Benz pickup trucks. I think it would be cool to have the Mercedes emblem on a dirty pickup truck. It is also a fact that Mercedes-Benz pickup trucks have not been invented yet—or not for mass consumption at least. They exist only in a designer’s rendition. It is also a fact that those trucks would be very expensive and probably require the sale of a kidney to afford. That last fact would be pretty high up on the con side of my list of facts about whether to purchase one. It is probably a fact that skydiving is exhilarating and provides a lifetime’s worth of memories. It is also a fact that skydiving requires me to be more than a few feet in the air and involves an airplane, and those two facts alone outweigh any possible exhilaration.</p><p class="calibre_9">In order to make a truly great pros and cons list, you have to gather all relevant information in the most objective way possible. Many times there will be some initial bias in favor of <a></a>or against a decision. We are human and we have instincts. If our initial instinct is to take the job or buy the car, we may be tempted to prioritize certain facts over others. Work to avoid that in the information-gathering stage. The way I have reconciled this in my own mind is to remind myself that I get to make the final decision regardless of the evidence. I can overrule a compelling fact and side with a seemingly smaller, less significant fact or piece of information. So if I have the power to make the decision, why would I not want all the information? Usually, people hide information from the decision maker. You are the decision maker! Why would you hide things from yourself?</p><p class="calibre_9">What this really does, in my own personal process, is buy me time. I know myself well enough to know that patience is not a strong suit of mine; I am likely to make a hurried or impetuous decision. I have to force myself to take time because for me, at least, time equals better decision making. Finding all relevant pieces of information can and should be somewhat time consuming. Some information will be obvious, some information will appear with just a little bit of thought, and then, I tell myself, there are pieces of information that separate the good investigators from the not-so-good investigators. Be the best sleuth or investigator possible and find that information others are not willing to invest the effort and, for me more importantly, the time to uncover.</p><p class="calibre_9">Once you’ve done that, you can start apportioning weight to the facts. This is where self-awareness plays a crucial role. <a></a>Knowing your priorities, abilities, motivations, aspirations, and opportunities will help you position items on your pros and cons list. Know the facts and know yourself.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you are weighing the facts, it’s important to consider benefits, opportunities, risks, and consequences. The word “consequence,” to me at least, has a somewhat negative ring to it. In reality, it is benign. Consequences are merely the results of action or inaction.</p><p class="calibre_9">Notice I did not say that you need to weigh the facts objectively. There is nothing objective about how we prioritize the things we love and fear in life. The gathering of facts should be objective, but the assigning of value to each of those facts is inherently subjective and individualized.</p><p class="calibre_9">So I started my list with the facts I had gathered:</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Pros of starting a new career as a state prosecutor:</span></span></p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">More variety in workload.</span></span> If I won the race, I would be handling more than just firearm and drug cases. I would work on the types of cases many prosecutors are driven to handle, such as armed robbery, burglary, rape, assault, and capital murder.</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">More purpose in what I do.</span></span> I had a nagging sense that the state court system is where most violent crime is prosecuted, and therefore that system needed good prosecutors as much as—or, to my mind, more than—the federal system.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">More possibilities to move up.</span></span> Successfully running for office would capture the attention of decision makers in the state who, when it came time, would select federal district court judges or the United States attorney. Being successful in an election for state prosecutor would open up paths to other positions in the justice system that I might want to pursue one day.</blockquote></li><a></a></ul><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Cons</span></span><span class="calibre3">:</span></p><ul class="calibre_19"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">I had to run for office.</span></span> Having never done that before, this was truly the biggest con on the list.</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">I could fail.</span></span> I was not leaving the U.S. Attorney’s Office to <span class="italic">become</span> the circuit solicitor. I was leaving the U.S. Attorney’s Office to <span class="italic">run</span> for circuit solicitor against a popular incumbent who had been in office for several terms and had no plans to leave office. In fact, he had just switched political parties from Democrat to Republican and solidified his support and had never lost a political race in either party.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">I would lose the security and familiarity of my current job.</span></span> Even before knowing the outcome of the election, I would have to leave my post as a federal prosecutor. Assistant United States attorneys cannot engage in partisan political activity. That means I could not announce my political plans or raise money while employed as a federal prosecutor. I’d have to step off the cliff before knowing if the safety net was below me.</blockquote></li><a></a><li value="4" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">I would have to fundraise.</span></span> How was I going to raise money in a race against the incumbent district attorney? Who would be dumb enough to take a chance on a completely untested newcomer and risk alienating the chief prosecutor for their home county?</blockquote></li><li value="5" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">I would be hard-pressed to find endorsements.</span></span> Other political actors would most likely hesitate to endorse against an incumbent. Incumbents are hard to beat, and they typically have long memories when it comes to who supported them and, more important, who did not.</blockquote></li></ul><p class="calibre_9">The contrast was coming into full view, and the risks significantly outweighed the rewards. Ninety-nine times out of one hundred, I would decide to stay at the United States Attorney’s Office. I cannot tell you the number of times I would leave our home on foot to walk the cart paths of the golf course nearby. Early in the morning or at night with a flashlight, our home golf course was my therapist and my counselor. I would walk and think the decision over, and each time I ended that walk with the conclusion that the risks were too great, the cons outnumbered the pros, and staying was the most prudent thing to do…and yet, I had no peace. I was <a></a>trying to make this decision the old Baptist way—choose something and wait for that thing they call “peace.” But it didn’t come. There was comfort. There was familiarity. There was security. There was settling. But there was no peace.</p><p class="calibre_9">Even when the cons outnumber the pros, sometimes one pro can outweigh all the cons. Sometimes your metric of success makes one factor outweigh twenty objections. This doesn’t mean you should ignore all the objections, though. Look at all the facts. Listen to the fears and advice you don’t want to hear. Ultimately, only you can know the weight of each fact.</p><p class="calibre_9">As peace in my decision to stay in my role as federal prosecutor evaded me, I thought about my mantra: “What’s the worst that can happen?” That, of course, was running and losing. So I began to build safety nets to soften the fall of defeat if that happened. I thought to myself, <span class="italic">I could get a job with a private law firm to make ends meet while I ran, to make sure my family was provided for. And maybe if I did a good job at that law firm, they would let me stay on after the election if I lost. And even if I ran and lost, it would still help me for the next race or the one after, if and when the current circuit solicitor decided to leave office</span>. I even imagined running for circuit solicitor and losing and then getting back in line to be a federal prosecutor again. I tried to conceive of every bad consequence imaginable from an unsuccessful race. Did I have a plan for surviving if any, or God forbid all, of those consequences were visited upon me?</p><p class="calibre_9">Taking into account all the pros, cons, lack of peace, feelings of potential regret, and worst-case scenarios, I finally decided to run for circuit solicitor. And I can tell you with absolute clarity that in hindsight, I was an idiot. Actually, in any sight—hind, forward, or sideways—I was an idiot. The risks were too great and the reward was way too unlikely. But I had thought through all the worst-case scenarios and determined failure would not be unbearable.</p><p class="calibre_9">On those cart path walks, I realized that my dreams had evolved and shifted. I no longer just wanted to be a prosecutor, I wanted to prosecute crimes that victimized people, and I wasn’t currently doing that. Ultimately the pro of purpose and meaning outweighed all of the arguments for security, predictability, and familiarity.</p><p class="calibre_9">Circuit solicitor was the revised dream, the goal that aligned with my desired closing argument in life. It aligned with my own definition of success. I decided to pursue that dream even when measured against the costs, the risks, and the sacrifices.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Seek Outside Perspective</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">I left my job as a federal prosecutor in February 2000 and shortly thereafter announced my run for circuit solicitor. The primary election was in June, so it would be a four-month sprint. Things were going as I expected early on. There was lots of door-to-door campaigning, there were nights spent <a></a>designing mail pieces and other campaign materials, and there were efforts to raise money so I could get those mail pieces out of my den and into the mailboxes of voters. It was lonely. I missed my former colleagues at the United States Attorney’s Office even more than I thought I would. The campaign was hard, but it was not unbearable. What I feared the most had not happened. Yet.</p><p class="calibre_9">And then it did, at a wedding reception of all places. I am not a huge fan of weddings, primarily because the suspense of guessing whether the blissful couple will opt for the unity candle or the mixing of the sand is so nerve-racking. (Kidding, sort of.) In actuality, my main objection to weddings is that they are almost always on Saturdays. There are lots of things happening on Saturdays, and all things considered, it’s a really inconvenient time to put on a suit and go to church. That is what Sundays are for. If I were in charge of starting trends, I would suggest we start having weddings on Monday mornings. There are no sports on television, and you have to get up and go to work anyway, so just make a detour to the wedding. It makes more sense. But alas, it was a Saturday, and Terri made me go to the wedding. Worse yet, she announced we were also going to the reception to follow.</p><p class="calibre_9">We were walking up the front steps of the reception hall, and someone called my name. I looked up to see none other than John B. White, Jr. John, Jr., was a prominent, successful, and well-respected legal and political figure in Spartanburg. I knew he did not support my candidacy for circuit solicitor <a></a>and was working on behalf of the incumbent. They had been friends for a long time, and I understood and accepted that. He approached me and spoke collectively for the opposing candidate and all his major supporters: “We like you, Trey. We think you have a future politically. But this is not the right race for you. We ran a poll. You are losing eighty percent to twenty percent. We don’t want to see you embarrassed. You may want to reconsider your decision.”</p><p class="calibre_9">It was one of the most jarring moments of my life. There it was: hard evidence of my looming demise. Eighty percent to twenty percent is beyond a landslide. It is a career-ending shellacking. I stood there with my mouth open. I was stunned. I had lived in Spartanburg since I was five years old. My father was a pediatrician. My mother had lots of friends. My wife was well known and beloved. Her family was well known in circles where mine was not. I thought we had support. How could I have miscalculated so poorly?</p><p class="calibre_9">I went to find Terri and let her know we needed to go. As in, right now. She thought I had seen a ghost (which I sort of had—the ghost of my dead political career). We got to my truck, and I just sat there. Stunned.</p><p class="calibre_9">In the truck on the way home, I told Terri I was going to drop out of the race. I was so mad at myself for leaving the United States Attorney’s Office, for having done such a poor job forecasting my electoral prospects, and for the embarrassment I would cause my wife, our children, and my parents by quitting.</p><p class="calibre_9">The desire to make pain end is powerful. So too is the desire to avoid pain before it comes. It is ironic in hindsight to consider the months I took to make the decision to run and contrast that with the instant in which I was ready to decide to drop out. Almost all the consequences of the decision to run were already borne, and yet I would have abandoned the race that very moment if I had been by myself in my truck. All because of a fear of failing in a publicly humiliating way. Narrowly losing is one thing. Failing on a large scale is so much worse.</p><p class="calibre_9">Terri prevailed upon me to at least call Dr. Dave Woodard, a political science professor at Clemson University, before dropping out of the race. He is smart and seasoned, and I leaned on him for political counsel for this and later on for many other situations. He is also known for his polling acuity in South Carolina politics. So why hadn’t I bothered to ask him to poll this race before I quit my job at the United States Attorney’s Office? If you know, please tell me, because I sure don’t!</p><p class="calibre_9">On that Saturday night in April 2000 at around 9:30 <span class="calibre1">P.M.</span>, I called Dave Woodard and shared with him the polling information from the opponent’s camp. “They ran a poll, Dave, and I’m losing eighty percent to twenty percent, and literally everyone in Spartanburg County politics, except one, has endorsed the other guy. I hate to do it, but I think I need to drop out of this race and save myself and my family any further embarrassment.”</p><p class="calibre_9">His reaction was immediate and succinct. “Thank God, you are up to twenty percent, Trey! That’s amazing. You were at two percent when I polled you last month! I didn’t want you to know where you were, so I didn’t share those results with you. You are doing great now! Keep it up!”</p><p class="calibre_9">Perspective. That is what I needed. Twenty percent is terrible if you are trying to get to 50.1 percent. But twenty percent is pretty good if you started at two percent. When making the decision to start something new, self-doubt will inevitably creep in. If you’re anything like me, you’ll zoom in on the negative potential outcomes, and as those become more realistic, you’ll have the urge to abandon ship. This is when we need to seek other perspectives and let those we trust weigh in on the matter. We should not look to others to make decisions for us, but sometimes they can offer a perspective we haven’t considered that makes our decision clearer.</p><p class="calibre_9">I wound up with almost 55 percent of the vote in June 2000. I won the primary and, against those initial odds, I was elected circuit solicitor. I believe I made a good decision in starting my career as a state prosecutor. It wasn’t a good decision because it paid off; it was a good decision <span class="italic">and</span> it paid off. Even if I had lost, I wouldn’t count it as a failure. Had I never run, that would have been the ultimate failure.</p><p class="calibre_7"><a href="index_split_007.html#filepos154225"><span class="calibre1"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">SKIP NOTES</span></span></span></a></p><blockquote id="filepos153723" class="calibre_5"><a href="#filepos123240"><span class="calibre3"><span class="calibre_2"><span class="underline">*</span></span></span></a><span class="calibre3"> Justice Sutherland, “Berger v.
