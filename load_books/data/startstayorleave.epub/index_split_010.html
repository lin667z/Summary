But staying isn’t just about not pursuing a particular path; it’s also about taking inventory of where you are, putting in the effort to build a better goal, and giving your initial decisions the gift of time and patience.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Commitment</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Signing up for college classes was something I always looked forward to. Once-in-a-generation genius is required to build a class schedule that does not include any morning classes, has a break to watch <span class="italic">All My Children,</span> and does not interfere with intramural sports in the afternoon, especially doing so without your parents finding out. I spent a lot more time signing up for classes in college than I did actually attending them.</p><p class="calibre_9">I remember the entry in the course catalog like it was yesterday. The course being offered was listed as “BL,” and the class was offered in the Student Union Building, which was <a></a>close to where I lived. It was one afternoon a week and did not interfere with intramural sports or soap operas, so it checked every one of my prerequisites.</p><p class="calibre_9">Bowling would be fun. It would be an easy “A” to bolster a grade point average in desperate need of one. I signed up for “BL,” and on the first day of class, I walked to the Student Union Building. But the bowling alley in the basement was empty, so I looked around for an explanation. It was the right day, the right time, and the right place, so something must be amiss.</p><p class="calibre_9">I found the posted notice indicating the class was meeting across the street in another building. It struck me as weird that a bowling class would not be held where the bowling lanes were, but my deductive reasoning skills were not very good at the time. I walked across the street, found the right room, and walked in.</p><p class="calibre_9">Think back to the worst, most embarrassing thing that has ever happened to you. Think hard. Conjure up the most cringeworthy situation you ever put yourself into. Maybe it was asking a woman if she was pregnant when she, in fact, was not. Maybe it was asking someone how a family member was doing, only to be reminded that the family member actually passed away years ago, and you attended the funeral. Maybe it was assuming the wrong dress code for a party and having to tell people your powder blue tuxedo was an ironic condemnation of societal norms. None of that compares to what I had just done.</p><p class="calibre_9">The “BL” did not stand for bowling, it stood for ballet. In front of me were a dozen young women and a male instructor, all in leotards. I entered, did the most gorgeous pirouette you have ever seen, and began to walk back out the door—all in one continuous movement.</p><p class="calibre_9">“Young man, you are in the right class,” the instructor yelled. Every single eye trained on me. “Are you Harold Gowdy?” he asked. I should have said, “No.” I should have said, “I am having a medical emergency” and left, never to return. But I didn’t. I said, “Yes, sir, but I go by Trey.” Oh, my heavens, what had I done?</p><p class="calibre_9">The instructor was a kind man named Rudy. He said that if I stayed in class, he promised I’d get an “A.”</p><p class="calibre_9">“Well, Professor Rudy,” I replied in a very weak attempt to extricate myself from this terrible miscalculation I had visited upon myself, “I don’t have the right clothes, and I don’t know anything about ballet.”</p><p class="calibre_9">He didn’t care.</p><p class="calibre_9">“None of that matters, son; you can wear what you like, and I’ll teach you what you need to know.”</p><p class="calibre_9">I’m glad I stayed in that class. I still have friends from that class almost forty years later. I still know all five ballet positions, although literally everything on me hurts when I try to do it and somewhere on earth Mikhail Baryshnikov is screaming, “Please stop doing that.” And I have a story that brings endless joy and happiness to Kevin McCarthy every time he tells it.</p><p class="calibre_9">More than amusing my friends or bolstering a grade point average, staying in that class taught me a couple of lessons that have remained with me for forty years. It taught me the importance of commitment, of challenging myself, and of not fleeing when things did not turn out precisely as envisioned.</p><p class="calibre_9">Sometimes the results of a decision are different from what you expected. The new company’s culture is less about autonomy than it is about sixty-hour workweeks. The dog you adopted is more work than you assumed, and the cuteness doesn’t entirely make up for your exhaustion. Sometimes you sign up for bowling and find yourself in ballet.</p><p class="calibre_9">The problem with constantly starting new things is they do not stay “new” for very long. The excitement wanes, the novelty wears off, the freshness can become stale. There is, for many of us, that moment of angst or doubt when what we thought something would be like, whether it’s a job, a house, or a relationship, isn’t exactly the way it turned out. And the temptation is to start something else “new” all over again. But by always eschewing the decision to stay in favor of what’s new, we will not learn or grow in any tangible or long-lasting ways. Staying, even when the job, class, or relationship isn’t exactly what you were expecting, enables you to prove to yourself that you are capable of commitment.</p><p class="calibre_9">I did not stay in that ballet class for anyone but myself. Sure, I did not want to hurt Rudy the ballet instructor’s feelings. Yes, I did not want the young women in that class to <a></a>think I believed myself too good for that class. But in truth no one would have noticed, cared, or remembered. But I cared. Could I stick with something that was unexpected, unplanned, and perhaps even initially unwanted? Could I surprise and impress myself?</p><p class="calibre_9">Rather than proving things to other people throughout our lives, we should value our own opinion of ourselves. I am not a runner, so I cannot relate to marathons, but I am certain there comes a mile of doubt—when you are tired and think to yourself, “I am the one running this dadgum marathon, so if I stop, or walk, or quit it doesn’t impact anyone other than me. Who are they to judge whether I should have stuck with it or not? They aren’t the ones with the blisters or the cramps.” And you are right. It is not for anyone else, just you. But you should care what you think of yourself every bit as much as, and perhaps more than, what others may think of you.</p><p class="calibre_9">Deciding to stay, even when the decision you thought you made is different from the aftermath of said decision, will help you develop an endurance that will be your companion as you travel the twists and turns on your way to your final destination. The more we switch roads, try to take shortcuts, and exit at the slightest inconvenience, the more likely we will find ourselves lost, directionless, and unsure how to get back on track. More often than not, doubling down on our commitments even when the path doesn’t meet our expectations will lead to our desired destination and teach us a lot about ourselves along the way.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Expectations and Experience</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">In your life you will have plenty of opportunities to change course—there is always another option. But there is no guarantee the next option will meet your expectations either. And if you persevere, if you stick with it, if you give it a little more time, you too may wind up with a lifelong memory of the five ballet positions (or maybe even something more practical!).</p><p class="calibre_9">The other advantage to sticking with a job, a hobby, a musical instrument, or a friendship is the gift of experience, which is the one thing you cannot get more of simply by wanting or wishing for it.</p><p class="calibre_9">When looking for jobs early on in our careers, we will often see on job applications or in rejection emails, “We are looking for someone with experience.” I heard that a lot when I was applying to be a federal prosecutor. “We are looking for someone with trial and courtroom experience.” If I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times and my reaction was always the same: “If you do not give me a chance, how will I ever gain experience?” Knowledge we can acquire. Skills we can learn. Persistence we can model. But we cannot rush experience, so if you have a chance, even under your less-than-ideal circumstances to gain experience, that alone is sometimes worth sticking around for.</p><p class="calibre_9">Practically speaking, when I was doing the hiring both at the Solicitor’s Office and in Congress, I was wary of the applicants who seemed to bounce around a lot—even if the <a></a>bouncing was always up or what was perceived as higher. Experience often means consistency, and consistency can mean dependability, and dependability is a fantastic character trait.</p><p class="calibre_9">So by staying, not only can you get the highly coveted experience many subsequent employers or business partners are looking for, but you also gain the reputation of being reliable, and from there it is a very short walk to one of the kindest things anyone can ever say about you in life’s closing argument: that you were loyal, that you stayed when others did not, that you did not abandon ship. Think for a moment who you would call if you needed something in a pinch. Who would drop what they are doing and help you, even if it meant inconveniencing themselves? And now I want you to think about who would call you if they were in that same predicament. Who thinks of you in terms of commitments and resolve and reliability?</p><p class="calibre_9">Yes, there is a reason we love the smell of new cars and we love taking the plastic off the handles of new putters or hearing the sound of opening a new can of tennis balls. But there is also something beautiful about the familiarity of a handshake with a dear friend or hearing someone say, “They should have left me a thousand times for better offers or options, but they stayed with me, and for that I will be eternally grateful.”</p><p class="calibre_9">The only way to get experience is to stay where you are and build the skills needed to excel there. Experience gives you the knowledge and confidence you need to thrive when you do eventually enter something new, and it also is a signal to <a></a>others around you that you aren’t always looking for greener grass—you are in it for the long haul.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Look at the Film</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">In 2016, I went from the end of one contentious congressional investigation, which was the probe into the murder of four brave Americans in Benghazi, Libya, to the beginning of another investigation, allegations of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Speaker Paul Ryan had placed me on the House Intelligence Committee, and that committee was launching an investigation into whether Russia tried to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. It was not what I signed up for or what I wanted, but apparently the fates were conspiring to punish me for something (probably for running for Congress in the first place).</p><p class="calibre_9">These types of investigations require investigators with experience and acumen; they require investigators like Sheria Clarke. Sheria Clarke was an investigative attorney who had served on the House Committee on Ethics, the House Select Committee on Benghazi, and the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Her background and legal career made her perfect to assist the Intelligence Committee with our nascent investigation into allegations of election interference. She applied for a position as a senior legal investigator and then asked for my advice on whether or not to take the job.</p><p class="calibre_9">I knew Sheria was experienced and selfishly wanted her to <a></a>join our team because she was smart and conscientious and we had worked together in the past, so there was familiarity and trust. She would have immensely helped the committee generally and me specifically. But when asked for advice, you have an obligation to provide the best counsel for the person asking, not for yourself.</p><p class="calibre_9">I didn’t think taking the position would benefit Sheria in the long run. D.C. politics is brutal, and contentious investigations make it doubly so. My advice was to pass on it. “It will be tough at first as the excitement grows around this developing investigation,” I told her, “but I think you should pass on this opportunity and stay where you are. You do not need your good name embroiled in what will likely be a years-long political fight.” I know that passing up titles and perceived advancement in the eyes of other Capitol Hill staffers is extremely difficult. She had been on the Hill for nearly a decade and the Hill is a very title-intensive place to work. People tend to judge you based on the title under your name on your business card. So to pass on a title that was considered a promotion could lead people to question your drive, ambition, and effectiveness.</p><p class="calibre_9">But that’s okay. “They are looking at the snapshot,” I told Sheria. “Look at the film of your entire tenure in D.C., not just a frame here or there.” Her closing argument for life included the words “respect” and “faith.” She had served on the House Committee on Ethics and garnered the respect of members of both sides of the aisle. She had survived the <a></a>contentious investigation into what happened in Benghazi, and even managed an excellent working relationship with staffers on the other side of the committee. Words like “fair,” “respectful,” and “professional” were used to describe her. She had already survived one very challenging investigation with her reputation intact. The odds were not in favor of surviving another, no matter her intent or good character. Her faith was the most important part of her being. It is a damning indictment of the current political environment to say that it is tough to rise within the ranks of congressional politics and keep your reputation for faith intact, but it is true.</p><p class="calibre_9">Sheria did not take the assignment. She chose to focus on her long-term aspirations, which may well have been jeopardized by serving on this specific committee. In fact, she wound up leaving Washington altogether. During the eight years I knew her, six of which we worked on the same committees, I never heard a negative word about her from anyone on either side of the aisle. That is focusing on the film and not the snapshot.</p><p class="calibre_9">You too will come to a crossroads. You too will be confronted with an opportunity that others tell you is “too good to pass up” or “once in a lifetime.”</p><p class="calibre_9">When you come to that crossroads, think about what will be best for you over the long haul, not what is best for you in the shorter term. Look at the film, not the snapshot. Commit to building out your big picture, even if it means not doing what others think you should.</p><p class="calibre_9">And you must also reflect on whether leaving gets you closer to your final closing argument in life. It is sometimes easier as we get older to reflect on lasting reputations, what we will be remembered for, if anything, and how we can influence that impression. But there is no reason we have to wait until middle age or beyond to appreciate the word “legacy” or the thought of what we will leave behind. Clearly our youth or early adulthood should not be dominated by thoughts of how it all will end. But the sooner we know the broad parameters for what we want to accomplish, and be, and be remembered for in life, the easier it is to know whether it is time to stay or time to leave.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Staying Is a Form of Moving Forward</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Staying put is not simply a defensive move. In fact, I have found that most often staying enables you to build your future with even more freedom.</p><p class="calibre_9">Wherever you are now, even if your circumstances are not ideal, I would encourage you to at least have a frank conversation with yourself about a couple of things. Are you really leaving what is troubling you? The one thing that follows us no matter where we go is ourselves. We should be honest enough to ask that question: Are you leaving a job, a relationship, a town, or a school because of external factors or is there something you really want to change about yourself, and changing your routine, surroundings, or zip code is a way of <a></a>avoiding the deeper conversation? Are you adrenaline or excitement dependent? By that I mean, have you come to fall in love with the feeling you get when starting over, starting fresh, the smell and feel of newness.</p><p class="calibre_9">Have you really given your current circumstances a fair trial?</p><p class="calibre_9">We have all been at a place I am about to describe: a party, a drop-in, a school or church event, and the person we are talking to is constantly looking around, over our shoulders, around our heads, to see if someone “better” or “cuter” or “more interesting” is coming. Truth be told, maybe we have done it ourselves a time or two. Or maybe it’s not a scene where we have some freedom, but it’s a seat on a plane or assigned seating at work or school and we just know we have nothing in common with the person we are near. Or do we? Did we even give the relationship a chance? Did we judge the exterior and not even stick around long enough to catch a glimpse of what was inside?</p><p class="calibre_9">Just because our current circumstances do not “feel” ideal or do not meet our immediate expectations for happiness, or we do not currently find the responsibilities at work challenging or helpful does not mean it will remain that way. Give it some time. Give it a chance. You are welcome to be “surprised if you change your mind.” I’ve said that a time or two in life myself: “Well, I’ll do it, but I am going to be really surprised if anything changes.” Sometimes things do not change, but <a></a>oftentimes they do. And something advantageous was gleaned because I stayed.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">1. Commit to sticking with it for a certain period.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">It could be one month, it could be a semester, it could be one year or five. But if we are always keeping one eye on the door and one foot out of it, we’ll never be truly present in the lives we are building. There’s always space to reevaluate, but when possible, give your decisions time to unveil all the opportunities therein.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">2. Look for ways to grow your skill set or challenge your potential.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Whether you are learning to cook, are given new responsibilities at work, or are working through conflict in a relationship, there will be challenges that arise that feel uncomfortable or unfamiliar. Turn those moments into opportunities to learn about yourself, others, or the world around you. Time spent learning isn’t wasted—it’s experience.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="italic">3. Determine whether there are pieces of your final closing scene present in your current reality.</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">At this current moment, in every area of your life, what are the pursuits that are helping you build your closing argument? Are there pieces present of what you want to accomplish and what you want your legacy to be in your current <a></a>reality? My guess is yes. And I would encourage you to highlight those areas in your mind and look for other opportunities to further your dream right where you are. By staying in ballet, I was able to retain my dream schedule and learn a lot about myself in the process. I remember more about that class than most I took during those four years.</p><p class="calibre_9">Dreams can only become reality with perseverance, work, and patience. Stick with them until they’ve fully run their course or until your main dream changes. Don’t chase every whim that captures your attention. There are times when no change is the best decision we can make; change isn’t necessarily progress. Staying may be difficult, boring, and thankless, but remember that you are building something that will live beyond you. And that, I’ve found, often makes staying worth it.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_11"></div>
