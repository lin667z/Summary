This is why it is invaluable to have people in your life who you can trust to point you in the right direction when you are heading the wrong way—or at least to spot the obstacles you may have missed.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">You Are the Man</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">We all know both types—the loner and the waverer.</p><p class="calibre_9">We know the loner, who tends to go through life making all of their own decisions, seeking no counsel but their own. They say, “I don’t care if everyone else thinks this is a bad idea. I am going to do it anyway.” Being alone in your decision making does not, per se, mean you are making the wrong decision. But if you are continually unratified even by those who share a common interest with you, then perhaps your <a></a>decision-making calculus isn’t adding up.</p><p class="calibre_9">We also know waverers who are paralyzed by indecision. Whether it is weakness, a desire to please, or a general lack of confidence, they will seek and heed the advice of too many people and change their minds hourly. Often, whoever gets to them last—before the actual decision is made—has the most influence. I was fortunate that the overwhelming majority of the judges I appeared in front of were smart, ethical, and fair. But a couple had a really tough time making decisions and being a judge is a challenging line of work if you do not like making decisions. One judge in particular stands out because whoever spoke to him last won. Period. He did not like displeasing people and he wrestled with his own decision-making ability. So we found ourselves jockeying to be the last person to speak to him because whoever was last was going to win. That is a waverer.</p><p class="calibre_9">The best decision makers synthesize the two approaches. They know their own mind and consult others on their vision. Wisdom is not only exercising the right judgment on your own but also having the discretion to know who is worth listening to and who is not. If you want to make the very best decisions in life, you must know yourself, weaknesses and all. And you should have a Nathan in your life: someone who has the nerve to speak to you before you make significant decisions and the courage to counsel and correct you after you make poor ones.</p><p class="calibre_9">Who is Nathan? Nathan was a prophet chronicled in the <a></a>Old Testament. Throughout King David’s reign, Nathan advised him on several matters, providing essential insight and direction around pivotal decisions. In my mind, one moment of the story stands out, when Nathan’s guidance was sorely needed but he was not consulted.</p><p class="calibre_9">Here’s an overview: King David committed adultery after seeing a beautiful woman bathing from his rooftop. Her name was Bathsheba. Her husband was off fighting in a war, a war in which David himself should have been leading the soldiers when he instead summoned her and slept with her. Shortly after, she sent word to David that she was pregnant.</p><p class="calibre_9">Seeking to cover up the mess he had made, David brought Bathsheba’s husband, Uriah, home from war for a few days, but Uriah refused to go inside his home to his wife because his fellow soldiers weren’t afforded the same luxury. So then David took drastic measures. He sent word to the military commander, saying, “Put Uriah out in front where the fighting is fiercest. Then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die” (2 Samuel 11:15 NIV).</p><p class="calibre_9">It would be hard to imagine a worse series of decisions than those David made in this case.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you are weak, powerless, and without authority, many people are willing to rebuke you. And when you are the most powerful person in the society you live in, it is difficult to find anyone who will tell you the truth. But Nathan was willing to speak the truth, even to the most powerful person in the country.</p><p class="calibre_9">In 2 Samuel 12, we see the essence of a good adviser:</p><blockquote class="calibre_6">The Lord sent Nathan to David. When he came to him, he said, “There were two men in a certain town, one rich and the other poor. The rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle, but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It shared his food, drank from his cup, and even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">“Now a traveler came to the rich man, but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him. Instead, he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him.”</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">David burned with anger against the man and said to Nathan, “As surely as the Lord lives, the man who did this must die! He must pay for that lamb four times over, because he did such a thing and had no pity.”</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_6">Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man!” (vv. 1–7 NIV)</blockquote><p class="calibre_9">You are the man! In our culture, we hear those words at sporting events. We hear them as a phrase of empowerment or an attempt to ingratiate ourselves with those in authority. That is not how Nathan meant it.</p><p class="calibre_9">You are the man! Those four simple words, spoken by a <a></a>prophet to a king, show what a trusted counselor should be willing to do for us and, conversely, what we should be willing to do for others. The best advisers, the ones who can help us make the best decisions in life, tell us what we need to hear rather than what we want to hear.</p><p class="calibre_9">The world is full of enablers. The world is full of sycophants. The world is full of people who want to make us happy, not better. Do you have a Nathan in your life who will not only tell you “You are the man” (or woman) after you have made a dreadful decision but also speak to you before you make the wrong decision? Who is the Nathan in your life?</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Humbling Advice</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">In February 2000, when I left what I thought was my dream job as an assistant United States attorney to run for circuit solicitor, I was also leaving the federal criminal justice system, which is the only criminal justice system I had ever known. Leaving what is familiar is hard, and sometimes you hear the Siren call to return.</p><p class="calibre_9">In 2001, I had barely been sworn in as the circuit solicitor when an opening arose for a position back in the federal system: U.S. magistrate judge. Federal magistrate judges work closely with United States district court judges on both criminal and civil matters. Magistrates are not Senate confirmed or appointed by presidents; rather, they are screened and elected <a></a>by the current U.S. district court judges. In other words, the federal judge I worked under for two years would be one of the people voting. So too would the other judges I had tried cases in front of for the previous six years.</p><p class="calibre_9">There were defensible reasons to make this quick change. Magistrate judges are elected for eight-year terms, and there is a heavy presumption that if you do your job properly, you will be reelected by the federal trial judges for subsequent eight-year terms. Eight years of guaranteed employment. Eight years of a good salary. And I would be back in a prestigious system with which I was familiar. This job promised many of the things that furthered one of my goals, that being security for my family, and therefore it furthered some aspects of my desired closing argument that I was a good husband and father who took care of his family. It also provided familiarity and consistency. This job was known. I would be working with the same people I had been working for. Was it my dream job? Of course not. Was it predictable, reliable, and therefore secure? Yes. And therein lies one of the battles or points of contention we will face in life: Do we settle or do we strive?</p><p class="calibre_9">It is true that I had spent months asking the people of my home county to support me, donate to me, and vote for me in my contentious circuit solicitor race against a longtime prosecutor. It is true that I had asked the voters for the right to represent them in state criminal court as their elected prosecutor. It is true that many people had taken a chance on me. But the opportunity to become a U.S. magistrate judge might <a></a>be the chance of a lifetime. It was security for my family. It was perceived as an honor. It could, in theory at least, later lead to a federal judgeship like the judge I clerked for after law school, and those jobs have lifetime security. Surely, the voters in my hometown would understand why I would leave a job I had only just been elected to serve in and go back to the system I had just left, right? Surely my wife, my parents, and anyone who had put their lives on hold for months to help me get elected would understand choosing the safe and the familiar over the vagaries of an elected position.</p><p class="calibre_9">I decided to go forward and pursue the magistrate judgeship. It would be awkward explaining why I was leaving the job of circuit solicitor after a few months into a four-year office, but what is a little awkwardness compared to providing for your family in the long term? What is a little awkwardness when compared to eight years of job security? Plus, the new job was harder than I thought it would be. Being the elected circuit solicitor is much different from being a simple line prosecutor at the United States Attorney’s Office. I had to hire, train, and supervise more than sixty employees. My office had to process tens of thousands of warrants. Police officers expected their cases to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law even though there was neither the time nor the resources to do that. We have all been warned, “Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.” Well, I got it. And I wasn’t sure what to do with it. And so we begin to rationalize with ourselves. We begin to make excuses within our minds and <a></a>hence we need counsel and advice from someone other than ourselves. Even if we may not <span class="italic">want</span> it, we <span class="italic">need</span> it.</p><p class="calibre_9">It’s been well over twenty years, but I remember my father stopping by my house like it was yesterday. My father is a slow starter when it comes to conversations. I think the word “glacial” was actually invented to describe his pace in getting to the gist of the matter. But not this time. It was clear from the moment he got to my house what was on his mind: “You cannot do this,” he said. “You cannot leave a job you were just elected to. It is not right, and it is not fair to everyone who helped you get elected. You owe it to them to honor the commitment you made.”</p><p class="calibre_9">I was not happy to hear this. <span class="italic">What does a doctor know about the justice system? Surely, he can understand a husband and father’s desire to provide some modicum of security and predictability for his family? This is just my father’s old-fashioned sense of honor.</span></p><p class="calibre_9">To me, it was a choice between being a prosecutor and becoming a judge, and being a judge would be an easier life at this juncture. No, of course it wasn’t exactly what I wanted to do and it wasn’t what I signed up to do, but there is no shame in being a federal magistrate judge. It may be a gateway job to the kind of judgeship Donald Russell had. There was that pyramid again.</p><p class="calibre_9">To my father, however, it was a choice between honoring the word I gave the voters in my home county and pursuing something that was solely more convenient for me.</p><p class="calibre_9">I did not get the validation and support I needed from my father, so I turned to someone closer to my age who knew a little something about risk, security, and the pressure of providing for a young family. I decided to talk to my old friend Ben Gramling.</p><p class="calibre_9">Ben and I had known each other since we were in our late teens. Our wives were best friends in college, and they introduced us to each other (and immediately regretted it). I’ve played more rounds of golf with Ben Gramling than with anyone else on earth. I watched him go from picking peaches in a family orchard to selling homes and small tracts of land to moving to Charleston, South Carolina, to launch a career in real estate development. This guy left home to pursue his dream. He left a comfortable family business to sleep in his car (literally) in Charleston to carve his own path. Surely, he would understand and support me. We spent hours one Saturday riding around roads in Spartanburg talking about this choice I had between staying the elected circuit solicitor and leaving that job prematurely for a job as a U.S. magistrate judge. When I explained the situation to him, he supported me. But he did not agree with me.</p><p class="calibre_9">Ben essentially agreed with my father but for entirely different reasons. Ben was not concerned with how the decision to leave an office early would be received by others. He understood the powerful draw of security and predictability in life. Instead, he argued that, to ever completely realize the full potential of life, you had to take some chances. The real risk had <a></a>been leaving the U.S. Attorney’s Office to run for circuit solicitor. That risk was over. There was not much risk in actually serving out my term. “If the ‘federal judgeship thing,’ ” as he called it, “is what you want, then there could possibly be other opportunities in the future. But once you take that judgeship, you are in essence not getting security but handcuffs. That is not a job you can leave. Not easily, at least.”</p><p class="calibre_9">The next morning was a Sunday. My wife and I were sitting in church, and I leaned over and said, “I am going to drive to Anderson to tell Judge Anderson I cannot take the magistrate job.” (Yes, Judge Anderson lives in Anderson, South Carolina. It’s a small state. What can I say?)</p><p class="calibre_9">“Are you sure that is what you want to do?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre_9">“No, I am not sure,” I replied. “But if I am not sure, maybe I should just stay put where I am and not make any change at all.”</p><p class="calibre_9">So, I got up during the sermon and walked to my truck, and I drove to Anderson, South Carolina, to tell the federal judge, who had done more for my career than anyone, that I was not going to take a job working with him. I was certain he was going to be upset with me. These jobs did not come around very often and were highly competitive when they did. The way I saw it, I was either going to disappoint my father by taking the job or disappoint Judge Anderson by not taking it. It was one of the most miserable drives I have ever made. I do not like disappointing people who have been good to me.</p><p class="calibre_9">I pulled into the driveway of his home in Anderson, and <a></a>the gate to his backyard was open. There he was in the back doing yard work.</p><p class="calibre_9">“What in the $%&amp;* are you doing here, Trey? It’s Sunday afternoon!”</p><p class="calibre_9">“Well, Judge, I need to tell you something, and I wanted to tell you face-to-face,” I said. “Judge, I want to thank you for everything you have done for me, but I cannot leave a job I was just elected to. I can’t leave this soon, even for something as great as a federal magistrate judgeship.”</p><p class="calibre_9">The pause seemed hours long. To say he could be mercurial would be a disservice to the word “mercurial.” And you did not usually have to wait long to figure out what Judge Anderson was thinking. If my father could be glacial, Judge Anderson could be volcanic. So, I braced myself. And then he spoke.</p><p class="calibre_9">“I never thought you should take the magistrate judgeship job in the first place, Trey,” he said. “Being a prosecutor would be much more fun. You should stay right where you are.” I had assumed Judge Anderson wanted me to follow in his footsteps, get back into the federal system, and work my way up to where and what he was: a federal judge. I assumed wrong. He had left the courtroom for the security of a lifetime appointment himself, but at his core, he was always a trial lawyer and, it turned out, that was really what he wanted me to be and do as well. He had traded his passion for security, albeit later in life, but there was still a tinge of regret as he recalled the “good ole days” as a courtroom lawyer versus the more, shall we say, predictable days as a courtroom judge.</p><p class="calibre_9">I was fortunate to have a father who cared enough about my decision making to tell me I was wrong. I was a grown man at that point in life, and he easily could have said, “You can make your own decisions and your own mistakes.” But he did not. He risked an uncomfortable conversation to help me put life in better order. He was a Nathan. So too was Ben Gramling. Ben is a peer, not a parent. He did not care what others thought about my decision or how it would land on an electorate. He just thought it was wrong for me as his friend, and he was not bashful about speaking up. I was grateful for both of their perspectives. Often, new opportunities look enticing. In this case I’m glad my Nathans helped me decide to stay.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Find Your Nathan</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When looking for Nathans in your life, look for three important traits:</p><ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">People who have your best interest in mind.</span></span> They care more about your betterment than your short-term “happiness.” They want to assist you in making sure you reach your desired closing argument.</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">People who know you well.</span></span> They know your strengths, weaknesses, and proclivities, and when you are prone to following fear and emotions too closely.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">People who are honest and courageous.</span></span> You need people who are not afraid to speak their mind, or whose care for you overcomes their fear of confrontation. Sometimes they may even hurt your feelings to protect you from hurting something even more significant.</blockquote></li><a></a></ol><p class="calibre_9">If we are going to have Nathans in our lives, then we need to be people who humbly listen to the wise counsel of others, people who do not get defensive or angry in the face of critique. Do you encourage candor among your advisers? Do your friends, family, and colleagues feel comfortable telling you you’re wrong? Do they feel empowered to speak up when decisions are being made? Once you find your Nathans, you must be willing to consult them.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">What’s the Opposite of Nathan?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Equally as important as figuring out who your Nathans are is evaluating who you do not want to advise you about your life. If you surround yourself with yes-men or yes-women or people who are indifferent to your definition of success, you may well find yourself stranded in the aftermath of poor decisions. The opposite of Nathan is not generally an archnemesis but rather a friend or acquaintance who just wants you to be “happy” in the moment. They don’t want to push back or challenge you in any way. Perhaps they view the job of a friend <a></a>as being a ratifier or a validator or someone who supports you no matter what you do. Support is one thing, and advice is another.</p><p class="calibre_9">Other times, the opposites of Nathan may want to push you down. The truth is, not everyone wants to see you do well. I had a Sunday School teacher in the eighth grade who first told me that: “Trey, don’t ever assume everyone wants to see you do well” were his exact words. I had no idea what he was talking about at the time. But I sure do now. I will let the psychologists explain <span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">why</span></span></span> not everyone wants you to succeed, but I just know the <span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">what</span></span></span>—and the <span class="calibre3"><span class="italic"><span class="bold">what</span></span></span> is that not every person who should have your best interest in mind will have it in mind—they could even be people close to you, people you look up to.</p><p class="calibre_9">The late Elijah Cummings was a colleague in the United States House of Representatives. He was a Democrat from Maryland, and I was a Republican from South Carolina. The circumstances of our service together put us on opposite sides of several issues and investigations, and we could fight for the cameras as well as Ric Flair and Hulk Hogan ever could (I’ll let you decide who is who in the Flair-Hogan analogy). But then there was the other 99 percent of the time we were together. There was never a cross word uttered between Elijah Cummings and me in what many would call “real life,” outside the committee room and away from cameras. There was never a moment of acrimony aside from what the political environment either manufactured or demanded at the <a></a>moment.</p><p class="calibre_9">The first long conversation Elijah and I had left a lasting impression on me. It was late one night in 2011 on a bus in Mexico City. We were there on a congressional delegation visit to talk to law enforcement in Mexico. At this point, Elijah was one of the most powerful members of Congress, having opted for public service after finishing a highly successful career as an attorney. It was his legal career he wanted to talk about in the early morning hours of that bus ride in Mexico, a legal career that very nearly never began.</p><p class="calibre_9">When Elijah was in high school, he let it be known he wanted to study the law and become a great trial lawyer. A guidance counselor at his school told Elijah that he would never be a lawyer. This guidance counselor had already determined Elijah would need to make a living “with his hands, not his head.” He not only set low expectations for Elijah, but he also did something even worse than that: He shared those low expectations with a young, impressionable student already trying to wrestle with the enemy of self-doubt.</p><p class="calibre_9">At this point in Elijah’s story I began to sense it was going to have a happy ending, because Elijah began to laugh. He poked me on the arm and mirthfully said, “Gowdy, you wanna guess who my first client was when I got out of law school? You wanna guess who that first person was to call me looking for legal help when I graduated and passed the bar?” Before I even had time to guess, Elijah answered his own question: “That same guidance counselor, that’s who!” Elijah <a></a>had a deep, rich laugh that made you want to join in his amusement. “Did you take him on as a client?” I asked. “Of course I did, Gowdy, but he paid full freight. I had forgiven him, but I never forgot.” Elijah became a successful attorney and congressman who ultimately would lie in state (or in honor) in the United States Capitol after his death.</p><p class="calibre_9">Not everyone wants to see you do well. Even people who should have your best interest in mind (like a guidance counselor) sometimes don’t, and you must learn how to distinguish the Nathans from the people who are trying to bring you down. Whether people are climbing the ladder, trying to get ahead of you, or projecting onto you the low expectations others placed on their lives, whatever reason they have, it’s not your burden to bear. But it is your caution to heed.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">What Other People Think of Us Is None of Our Business</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Tim Scott, John Ratcliffe, Kevin McCarthy, and I frequently went to dinner while I was in Congress. That was the core group, and we also had a handful of regular guests. We adopted a “no negative” rule at our dinners: We would never bring up something negative that was said or written about us. It was a safe zone. If it’s already been said or written, we can’t change it, so why bring it up?</p><p class="calibre_9">Occasionally a guest would violate that rule, but the violation did not last long. One guest started a sentence with, <a></a>“Tim, I cannot believe what that person said about you on Twitter.” I politely warned our guest that if he finished that thought, I would stab him with my butter knife. He began to finish anyway and Ratcliffe said, “Do not utter another word. We do not discuss those things.” Finally, our guest got the message and survived the dinner with no knife wounds.</p><p class="calibre_9">The way we saw it, we knew each other better than anyone in the media knew us. So why would we entertain the uninformed opinions and presumptions of strangers when we could enjoy one another’s company and talk about literally anything else? When we start letting people who don’t know even the slightest details of our lives, our motivations, or our character determine our worth, or even impact our conversations and decisions, we have lost our way.</p><p class="calibre_9">Whether in the public eye or not, we live in a time when strangers feel entitled to express unsolicited opinions about anyone and everything, and if we don’t learn to filter out the noise, we’re going to lose ourselves in the cacophony of uninformed judgments. Making the right decisions and exercising the right judgment is hard enough without an army of people we don’t know weighing in. When we allow them to alter the weight and balance of our decisions, things go askew. We should not allow the opinions of people who will not even witness our closing arguments impact our decisions.</p><p class="calibre_9">Why do you care what someone says about you on social media? Who do you think knows you better? You or someone with a bad Twitter avatar operating under a nom de plume? <a></a>Honestly, ask yourself, why do you care what others think about you? I used to see House members sitting on the floor of the House for entire voting series thumbing through their social media feeds. They were addicted to what others thought about them. You are rarely as good or smart as people say you are, and you are likely not as dumb or terrible either. If you want objective feedback on your decisions, why not ask people who know you and your motivations? Why ask people halfway across the world who have never had a single conversation with you?</p><p class="calibre_9">You’re not going to change everyone’s opinion of you, and putting your effort toward that wastes time that could be spent with the people who do know and love you. When it comes to strangers’ and acquaintances’ opinions of us, we should mind our business, let them think what they will, and live our lives.</p><p class="calibre_9">In my experience, Nathans are people who come alongside you and build you up, whereas some strangers, especially on social media, are intent on pointing out your faults. Call that cynical or reductionist, but when it comes to who I look to for my sense of self-worth, you will not find me consulting my Facebook friends or the comment section of some news story on a website. You’ll find me at dinner with the people in my inner circle, talking about the things each of us is a respective expert on, which is ourselves and our motivations in life.</p><hr class="calibre5"/><p class="calibre_3">—</p><p class="calibre_9">When I think back on the life of King David, I see a man who needed Nathan’s honesty after making a grave mistake. You will be fortunate—and have the best judgment—if you can cobble together a small group of counselors who will tell you what you need to hear rather than what you want to hear. (Their number should be no more than you can count on two hands.) And you need to make yourself available to them.</p><p class="calibre_9">What David didn’t know was that he actually needed Nathan on the rooftop with him when he first saw Bathsheba. It’s great to have your Nathans tell you what you could have or should have done after the fact. It is exponentially better to have access to that information before you make your decisions. And the way to get what you need is to always leave the door to the rooftop open and unlocked. Or more accurately, to give the key to a trusted few.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_14"></div>
