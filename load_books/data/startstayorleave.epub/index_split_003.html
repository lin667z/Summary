By creating a clear picture in your mind of your final destination, you will be better equipped to make decisions that ensure you reach that desired place.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Writing the Closing Argument</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Federal murder cases are rare.</p><p class="calibre_9">Because people tend to equate “federal crime” with “more serious crime,” they are often surprised to learn that the vast majority of murder cases are prosecuted not in federal but in state court, tried by state prosecutors. Only certain categories of murder warrant jurisdiction in the federal system—such as <a></a>the murder of a federal judge, the murder of a federal law enforcement officer in the line of duty, or the murder of a federal witness.</p><p class="calibre_9">Prior to 1995, there had been only one federal murder prosecution in twenty-five years in the Upstate of South Carolina. Our state is divided into four regions. There is the Low Country near the beach (think Charleston). There is the region called the Midlands, which is where our capital of Columbia is. There is the Pee Dee region, which is largely agricultural. And there is the Upstate, which is a region connecting Atlanta, Georgia, to Charlotte, North Carolina, along Interstate 85. That’s where I live and have worked, and the region I represented in Congress.</p><p class="calibre_9">Just once in a quarter century had there been a federal murder case in my home region. But there would soon be two. The second one involved the murder of one of my own witnesses. I had just turned thirty years old and was still early into my career as a federal prosecutor. I was in a courtroom in Anderson, South Carolina, long before the advent of cellphones. We used pagers back then and my pager was vibrating a lot while I was in court that day. You don’t look down at your pager while you are in federal court, so I waited for a break and what I saw was a series of 911 pages from law enforcement officers. I hurried back to the judge’s chambers, which were adjacent to the courtroom, to use the nearest landline. When I reached one of the federal agents who had been paging me, his response was immediate and direct: <a></a>“Ricky Samuel has been killed.”</p><p class="calibre_9">Ricky Samuel was a young man from Spartanburg, South Carolina, who had been in some relatively minor legal trouble, but he was trying to change the course of his life. His current challenge was a pending federal drug case. The drug amounts were small but, as you will soon learn, even a small amount of drugs can have a significant impact on your life. Ricky was lucky in that he had a mother who loved him very much and was tougher on him than the court system was ever going to be. He also had a new girlfriend, and the thought of going to federal prison for any period of time was not likely to enhance this new relationship. Ricky had a decision to make. He could serve several years in federal prison for narcotics dealing or he could try to reduce his exposure to prison time.</p><p class="calibre_9">The federal drug system works like this: There are mandatory minimum prison sentences for even relatively small amounts of drugs. Five grams of cocaine base, commonly referred to as crack cocaine, equaled a mandatory minimum five years in prison. Fifty grams of cocaine base equaled a mandatory minimum ten years in federal prison. A gram is the size of a packet of Truvia or Sweet’N Low. Ricky was charged with possessing an ounce of cocaine base, and even by pleading guilty and fully accepting responsibility, he would have received more than five years in federal prison. There is no parole in federal court so he would have served the overwhelming majority of whatever sentence was imposed.</p><p class="calibre_9">The only way to reduce one’s exposure to prison time, once <a></a>arrested or indicted, is to cooperate with the government and have the government petition the court for a shorter prison sentence at the time of the sentencing hearing. Cooperating with the government means providing historical information on who one’s drug suppliers were or who were the partners or co-conspirators in the drug ring. Cooperating could also include more active work such as wearing a wire during an undercover drug transaction. In fact, the most significant cuts to prison sentences were often reserved for those who took the most risks in cooperating with the government. Wearing a wire and conducting undercover drug transactions were risky.</p><p class="calibre_9">I had hundreds of conversations with young men, and a few women, who, like Ricky Samuel, had that choice to make: do the time or cooperate and deal with the consequences of being labeled a “rat.”</p><p class="calibre_9">The federal agents and I laid out Ricky’s options for him and his mother, and Ricky made the decision to cooperate with federal law enforcement in their investigation of a large South Carolina narcotics trafficking ring with ties to Florida.</p><p class="calibre_9">In reality, it was not much of a decision. Prison would be hard for Ricky. He was small in stature and had a slightly deformed arm, which would have made self-defense, often a necessity there, harder for him. He was not violent; he was just another young man who stopped his education too soon for the lure of easy and fast money. We shared with him that there were risks associated with cooperation, much like the doctor who goes over the risks before giving a flu vaccine or having <a></a>relatively minor surgery. Yes, there is a chance something bad will happen, but the chances are so small that they tend not to even register. Until they do.</p><p class="calibre_9">We asked Ricky to help us in our investigation into Tommy Pabellon. Pabellon was a drug dealer who had sold cocaine base in larger amounts than someone like Ricky Samuel. Law enforcement’s plan had Ricky, acting in an undercover capacity, purchase cocaine base from Pabellon. It would be what the cops call a “buy bust.” An informant, typically wearing an audio or video wire or both, buys drugs from a suspected dealer with marked money. The deal is set up via phone or pager and those conversations are recorded as well. A short time after the transaction is completed, the dealer is arrested and, more often than not, the marked money is in his possession. These cases are common and not particularly complicated. The evidence consists of the recorded calls setting up the transaction, video and audio surveillance of the transaction itself, and then the proceeds of whatever is on the suspect when the arrest is made.</p><p class="calibre_9">Ricky did what he was told to do. The undercover drug transaction went down exactly as planned. Pabellon sold Ricky the drugs and was arrested a short time later and a short distance away with the marked buy money in his pocket.</p><p class="calibre_9">Once Pabellon was arrested, he had the same opportunity Ricky Samuel and others had—plead guilty, go to trial, or cooperate and lessen his exposure to prison. Pabellon opted for trial, and before the trial date was reached, the <a></a>government had to produce what is called discovery, which is all of the evidence the government has as it relates to the defendant. The government tries to keep the identity of any informants or cooperating witnesses concealed for as long as possible, but inevitably those names are disclosed to the defense counsel, and then in turn the defendants themselves learn the identity of the informants. The disclosure of witness names is always a nervous time for prosecutors and agents and the witnesses themselves. Some defense attorneys share portions of the discovery with their clients but not all of it, and some defense attorneys just drop off the packets of information at the jail and allow the client to peruse the information for themselves. More than once discovery from one case has been found in the jail cell of another inmate. News about cooperating witnesses travels fast.</p><p class="calibre_9">The disclosure of witness names is one part of the criminal justice system that vexes those outside the system and frustrates those inside the system, even though we understand why it is necessary. Defendants have a constitutional right to “confront” witnesses as well as the right to know what evidence exists and will be presented at trial. The Confrontation Clause is in our U.S. Constitution. Even children have to testify in the trials of those who abuse them, sitting alone in a witness chair surrounded by adult strangers, with the defendant, the person who hurt the child, positioning himself squarely in the line of sight of the child. Our system affords <a></a>significant safeguards to those accused of crimes, and part of that is knowing who the witnesses will be against that particular defendant.</p><p class="calibre_9">It is a separate and serious crime to threaten or intimidate witnesses. But sometimes those already charged with violating the law show disregard for other parts of the law.</p><p class="calibre_9">Tommy Pabellon found out during the discovery process that Ricky Samuel was the informant in his case, and he believed that if Ricky was not around to testify at trial, there would be no case against him. Pabellon devised a plan with other co-conspirators in his drug ring to have Ricky killed, and he hired an out-of-state hit man named Bob Harry Fowler. Fowler came to Spartanburg, South Carolina, and posed as a neighborhood street preacher in an effort to gain Ricky’s trust, doing door-to-door “evangelizing” in Ricky’s neighborhood. The plan worked. Over the course of a few weeks, Bob Harry Fowler developed a relationship with Ricky and then, under the guise of taking him to be baptized, Fowler lured him to a remote pond in a neighboring county where he had Ricky get on his knees to pray the “Sinner’s Prayer” and accept Jesus as his Lord and Savior. Fowler then shot Ricky twice in the back of the head.</p><p class="calibre_9">Ricky Samuel’s body was later found where he had been executed, beside that small pond in rural Greenville County, with two bullet wounds to the head. He was executed in retaliation for providing assistance and information to federal <a></a>law enforcement officials. He was killed in a failed attempt to make the drug case against Tommy Pabellon disappear. No key witness, no case. At least that is what Pabellon thought.</p><p class="calibre_9">When I arrived at the murder scene, my first thought was of Ricky’s mother, of how we—federal agents and prosecutors alike—had assured her that the government would do everything in its power to protect her son if he decided to provide us with information. It was of little solace that we had explained what could happen. What was thought to be exceedingly rare—the harming of a federal witness—had in fact happened. Ricky had entrusted us with his life, and his mother had entrusted us with her son, and we had failed them both.</p><p class="calibre_9">Law enforcement gathered a general description of the new “evangelist” in Ricky’s life from his family and friends, but Fowler had given a false name and left town immediately after he killed Ricky. Luckily, the forensics team found a Bible in Ricky’s home that Fowler had given to him as part of his street preacher ruse, and a forensics technician painstakingly went through that Bible, page by page, looking for fingerprints. When he found one, on a page in the book of Ezekiel, we ran the fingerprint through a national database to see if there was a match in anyone’s criminal history file. Because the “evangelist” had prior convictions in other states, there was a hit in the database.</p><p class="calibre_9">How did a fingerprint from a contract killer from Alabama get on a Bible in Ricky Samuel’s home in Spartanburg, South <a></a>Carolina? Why did this “street preacher” leave town so quickly after Ricky was killed? Why did the man who spent so much time around Ricky in the days and weeks before his death not even bother to attend his funeral? Those were just a few of the questions the prosecutors would ask the jury to reflect on at trial.</p><p class="calibre_9">The investigation into Ricky Samuel’s murder was long and difficult. After Bob Harry Fowler was identified, he was located and arrested for murder. But we had to connect him to Tommy Pabellon, and neither Fowler nor Pabellon was talking.</p><p class="calibre_9">While agents were actively working on putting the pieces of the murder case together, I decided to do something else: I decided to prove to Tommy Pabellon just how wrong he was about whether he could be prosecuted even without Ricky Samuel. So off to trial we went, and Pabellon was convicted of the drug charge even without Ricky Samuel present as a witness. But he also needed to be held to account for the murder of a federal witness.</p><p class="calibre_9">Law enforcement wound up arresting Tommy Pabellon’s wife on other charges and she eventually provided evidence and testimony against Tommy. The real break came when one of Tommy’s co-conspirators in their drug ring decided to cooperate, just as Ricky had, in an effort to reduce the significant time he was facing for conspiracy to murder a federal witness. We interviewed this co-defendant, corroborated his <a></a>version of events, and planned on using him as a witness in the trial. He would have been a powerful witness, implicating both himself and Pabellon in the murder-for-hire scheme. And then this witness hanged himself in a prison cell.</p><p class="calibre_9">Law enforcement agents and prosecutors have to work with the evidence they have. They do not get to create the evidence they want or need. Fowler and Pabellon had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel, and Fowler had the means and access to do so. But still the trial would be about connecting Fowler to Pabellon. Pabellon did not pull the trigger, but he was the reason the trigger was pulled.</p><p class="calibre_9">The late, great federal prosecutor David C. Stephens and I prosecuted the case together. Stephens told me early on in our preparation that I would be doing the closing argument. All parts of a criminal trial are important, from pretrial motions and jury selection all the way through to the charging of the jury and the deliberations. But the closing argument is the last chance prosecutors get to make their argument to the jury. It is considered supremely important. I had made some closing arguments before but never in a case of this magnitude. And so I began a practice that I came to use in every case I prepared, prosecuted, and tried afterward: I started at the end.</p><p class="calibre_9">I wrote the closing argument first, and then worked my way backward to the beginning of the trial. There were witnesses to be called and examined and cross-examined. There were legal arguments to be made and exhibits to be introduced. I structured the presentation of evidence to get me to <a></a>my desired ending.</p><p class="calibre_9">The closing argument is last. But it is also most important. I started with what was most important and made sure everything else worked in tandem with that.</p><p class="calibre_9">Starting at the end helped me in that first murder case, and I used that strategy in every trial thereafter. Eventually I embraced the tactic outside the courtroom, and it became the framework I’ve employed in every major life decision I’ve faced since then. Start at the end and then figure out how to get there.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Last Scene</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">One of the joys of middle age is that sometimes young people mistake longevity for wisdom. As a result, I frequently have young people visit or call, looking for advice on their nascent careers. I let them talk first, and what I typically hear is a confession of uncertainty, anxiety, and apprehension. They are not quite sure what they want to do—or even who they want to be—but someone, somewhere told them they needed to have life figured out at the tender age of seventeen. And the pressure begins to mount, at least in their minds. Sometimes these young people are worried about making money; sometimes they are worried about finding a fulfilling career path. Most are worried—some are even paralyzed—by the fear of making the wrong decisions.</p><p class="calibre_9">I remember one young man who came to see me when I <a></a>was in Congress. He had life all mapped out, but it required him to gain admittance to one of our military academies. If that did not happen, according to him, nothing else would happen and his life was essentially over (at the age of seventeen) because it all hinged on going to West Point or the Naval Academy. Put aside for a second just how incredibly competitive those schools are and how little control the applicants have over whether or not they are selected. I could not get over his deep belief that all of his hopes and dreams hinged on being accepted at one of two highly competitive and selective schools.</p><p class="calibre_9">My first response had nothing to do with how to gain admittance to a highly selective college or university. I simply asked him where he wanted to wind up. It turned out he wanted to wind up exactly where I was, which was in Congress. “Who told you going to Annapolis or West Point was a necessary condition to running for Congress?” I asked him. “And who told you that even graduating from West Point or Annapolis would guarantee electoral success? And how will that make you a more effective member of Congress even if you are successful in both?” The real question, I tried to convince him, is not where he would spend the next four years but an even deeper, more significant question. Where did he want to be for his <span class="italic">last</span> four years? What did his last four months looks like? Last four minutes? Without being moribund, I wanted him to lean back in that chair in my office, <a></a>close his eyes, and visualize a picture. The picture I wanted him to paint, with the most vivid details he could conjure, is the final scene.</p><p class="calibre_9">You can do the same.</p><p class="calibre_9">You’ve passed from this world, hopefully after a long, happy, and healthy life, and family and close friends are waiting in a line to receive visitors. There is no more chance to leave a mark, make amends, rethink a decision, or change the story. Imagine the closing argument for your own life.</p><p class="calibre_9">When you think of that funeral scene, place yourself in that room eavesdropping on the conversations. If you see yourself as an angel, that’s fine. I don’t think I will qualify for that title, so I will go with just a spirit or a ghostlike figure lurking above the receiving line, but I want you to answer two questions:</p><ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">What have you accomplished?</blockquote></li><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">How are you remembered?</blockquote></li></ol><p class="calibre_9">Considering what people might say about them at their funeral usually snaps my young visitors to attention. (Or scares them away.) No one really enjoys thinking about the end. It’s hard and final, and it is understandable that we would rather dwell on happier thoughts. But death is one of the few things that is absolutely guaranteed in our lives, so these are important questions to ask, despite the uncomfortableness of <a></a>it all. We have to will ourselves to do it—to think about the closing argument of life so we can structure the evidence and pick the witnesses who will testify about our lives. If life can be compared to a trial and if there is a final argument, a closing statement of sorts, what will be said and is there evidence to support it?</p><p class="calibre_9">The truth is, for many young adults figuring out what they want to do after they turn eighteen, their decisions revolve around vocation. What career field do they want to enter when they graduate? I try to encourage them to think of the other areas of their lives as well. What we seek to accomplish in life, in my judgment, should not be confined to a single area but should span relational, vocational, educational, and personal realms.</p><p class="calibre_9">We are human, of course, and a perfect balance is impossible, but thinking through how the various areas of life co-exist with one another helps give us better direction. If you make a lot of money but have no time for family, will you have accomplished what you want in life? If you are singularly focused on socializing in college and neglect your studies, are you setting yourself up to accomplish everything you want to achieve? All friends and no job is sort of like “all hat and no cattle.”</p><p class="calibre_9">At any age, focusing on what we want to accomplish in a variety of areas will help give us that holistic picture as we move through life. When we decide to look at life through the <a></a>lens of what we want to accomplish rather than simply what we want to do, life gains the significance we covet and our decision making will gain a sense of purpose.</p><p class="calibre_9">I wish I had a nickel for every young person who told me they wanted to make a difference in their community, their state, or their nation. Their motives were pure, near as I could tell. They really wanted to effectuate change. So, I listened and nodded my head as they explained to me why they needed to go to law school, and then go into politics or government, in order to bring about that change our society so desperately needed. And when it was my time to offer advice, it was always the same advice: If you want to change the world, you should teach.</p><p class="calibre_9">Teachers have changed my life more than any United States president or cabinet member. The person I live with, a first-grade teacher, will change the world more in one semester than I did in eight years in the House of Representatives.</p><p class="calibre_9">The prestige of what you do and the importance of what you accomplish are two entirely different things. The sooner we learn that truth, the more fulfilling life will be. If you are going to make the very best decisions in life, you are going to have to be honest with yourself. We all try to say the right things when others are listening. Say the honest thing when it is just you doing the talking and listening. I encourage these young people I have the good fortune to visit with to have a frank conversation with themselves about their real <a></a>motivations as they relate to the decisions before them.</p><p class="calibre_9">Now, having a clear vision of the end is essential, but the actions you take to bring that image to life are what will determine whether you reach your desired destination. This is one case where it is not merely the thought that counts. You build your closing argument with the daily decisions you make. How you speak to people, how you make others feel, how you conduct your business, how well you take care of yourself and those you love, how much you help those in need, how generous you are with your time or money—all that is evidence that will be used and relied upon for your own closing argument in life.</p><p class="calibre_9">The things you think, do, and say each day are leading you to your final destination. Your decisions, wittingly or unwittingly made, will guide you somewhere, so I would encourage you not to keep that desired destination a secret—especially from yourself. Put another way, the more you think about your closing argument now, the more likely you will be able to shape it between now and when folks put on their Sunday best to bid you farewell.</p><p class="calibre_9">And if we want to make the decisions that lead us to our desired closing arguments, we need to evaluate where we are now—as in today, the very moment you read this. If you need to change direction or the speed with which you are moving, now is the perfect time to analyze that. Are you happy in your career, school, major, key relationships? When you consider <a></a>the big things like vocation, family, friendships, business relationships, and marriage, are you on track for your desired closing argument?</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">What Do You Want to Accomplish?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">There is a tremendous difference between what we “do” and what we “accomplish.” Accomplishing something requires intent and purpose. Accomplishing something requires foresight of the ending. When we work toward accomplishing something, we have direction; if we are merely doing something, we are moving without direction, and we are more likely to get lost.</p><p class="calibre_9">For example, when I was considering college majors, I looked at what I needed to <span class="italic">do</span> to graduate, which was accrue 120 credit hours, rather than what I wanted to <span class="italic">accomplish</span> in life. I chose history because I went to college with six hours of Advanced Placement credit in history from high school, and that credit reduced the number of classes I needed for the major.</p><p class="calibre_9">I would have been much better off, in hindsight, majoring in philosophy so I could learn to think more critically or psychology so I could understand human nature. Thinking critically and understanding human nature are essential to helping people who have been the victims of crime, which is what ultimately wound up being what I wanted to accomplish in <a></a>life.</p><p class="calibre_9">But still, I found a way to make it work because <span class="italic">there are multiple routes to get to a destination</span>. Some poor decisions cost you a lot, and some cost you next to nothing. I majored in history and wound up going to law school and ultimately found a career in the justice system that I loved. Even though I would have done college differently if given the chance, I eventually made sense of the path I chose and got to my destination despite the fact that the path was more circuitous than it needed to be.</p><p class="calibre_9">You are not “finished,” as that young man tried to convince me, if you don’t get into an elite military school. Your life is not “over” because you didn’t get your dream job. You are not free to “give up” because you did not get an invitation to join this group or club. One misguided decision or unexpected setback might stop you from doing something specific, but it does not hinder you from accomplishing what you want to in life; it might just take you a little longer to get there. All routes may not be equal in length, difficulty, or scenery, but they can get you where you want to be if you are clear on your destination and dogged in your pursuit.</p><p class="calibre_9"><span class="italic">Do not forget to consult your dreams.</span> Usually when I ask young people what they hope to accomplish, I can see their eyes light up as they think about what some call dreams and others call goals or aspirations. Some of these young people are reluctant to verbalize those dreams for fear they will be perceived as too wild, fanciful, or unattainable. I am the first <a></a>one to tell you that logic has a role in decision making. But it is essential and liberating to verbalize what we dream to be or do.</p><p class="calibre_9">Logic and dreams can be roommates. They can be travel companions. That will be a recurring thread throughout this book (although some of the decisions I’ve made in life may seem to indicate that logic was taking a nap while my dreams drove the car). Logic will and should take the lead. But when forming your image of the end and thinking through what you want to accomplish—what you want to be said of you to your family in the receiving line—it’s important to give your dreams the freedom to appear, exist, and be respected. Let them roam your mind as you explore where you want to go. Dreams may not dictate short-term decisions, but they help chart the longer course. There may even come that moment in your life when your dreams become real enough or lived enough to say, “We are here. We finally made it.”</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">How Do You Want to Be Remembered?</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">For me, the picture of the end I envision is my wife and children at the mortuary not far from where we live. I delivered a newspaper early in the mornings to the mortuary office when I was a teenager, so it’s a familiar and friendly scene. (Well, as friendly as a mortuary can be to a fourteen-year-old on a moped in the dark.) Hopefully, it’s a sunny day so my wife isn’t cold, because she would be cold running wind sprints on <a></a>the floor of an active volcano. The sun definitely needs to be bright and engaged in this photograph in my mind so she is warm and content. Plus, I won’t be there for her to tell me how cold she is.</p><p class="calibre_9">Ideally the service will be in the middle of the afternoon, so she can work most of the day at the elementary school where she teaches, take a short break for my service, and still get back home in time to watch <span class="italic">Love Comes Softly</span> or <span class="italic">Love Comes Today</span> or whatever is the most recent iteration of the exact same movie she has seen a trillion times on the Hallmark Channel. And, of course, the sooner the service ends, the sooner she can reach out to Matthew McConaughey on social media to let him know of her newfound availability.</p><p class="calibre_9">In my closing scene, I want it to be clear that I was a prosecutor, that I helped crime victims and their families fight for justice and accountability. I want people to think I was a loving husband to my wife and tried to be a good father to our children. This is the time for those who actually knew me—not the media, not my critics, not those who proliferate the comment sections of websites or social media posts—to say what they remember. I can think of nothing less credible than people who never met you or engaged with you describing your life to those who actually did know you. I hope people will say, “He was funny and fair.” That would be a nice combination to leave with those I loved. It doesn’t matter to me whether anyone mentions Congress or not, although someone I met in Congress will be preaching the funeral. Likewise, <a></a>it is not important to me that television or media be mentioned, although there is nothing in the world wrong with a career in the media, and I’m grateful for the job. It’s just that the courtroom is the job that meant the most to me, and therefore the one I hope others will remember.</p><p class="calibre_9">That final picture has the people who knew me best making my wife laugh with a memory or making her proud with a story. Funny and fair. That doesn’t sound overly ambitious, and, truth be told, that desired closing chapter or final picture may well have been different twenty years ago, before I understood the difference between who we are and what we do for a living. But it is settled now, and it likely won’t change at this point in my journey.</p><p class="calibre_9">What do you want people to say about you when you are gone? Where do you want to wind up, and what are you currently doing and deciding to make sure you make progress on that journey? Do you know yourself well enough to answer those questions today? Do you know yourself well enough to even <span class="italic">ask</span> those questions today?</p><p class="calibre_9">Your picture doesn’t have to include a funeral or service. It can be a retirement party or a hundredth birthday party or a seventy-fifth wedding anniversary. It’s not about the event. It’s about how you live on in the lives and memories of others, how you’ve made an impact, and what you’ve built with your life. You will be remembered by someone and for something. For how long and in what way is up to you. My hope is that our decisions can lead to a legacy that aligns with our dreams <a></a>and intentions.</p><p class="calibre_9">It’s worth noting that your picture of the end may well evolve, as mine did, over time. Hopefully, as it changes and grows, there will be a general consistency or theme. As you begin living out your life, your end will hopefully become clearer and more defined. Yes, there will be curveballs and pitfalls. What we plan is not always what actually happens. We need to be capable of adapting, while still keeping our eyes on that end goal and picture.</p><p class="calibre_9">There is a Walmart near the home my wife and I have lived in for close to a quarter century. I frequented this Walmart quite a bit, especially when our kids were young. Our son loved LEGO sets and our daughter loved Barbie dolls and stuffed animals, so I spent lots of time in the toy section specifically. Every time I would haul my kids there to buy them more toys they didn’t need, we passed a greeter at the door. It was almost always the same greeter. Her name was Frankie, and she always had a story (usually with some length to it), always had some advice for me as a prosecutor, always had a piece of advice for law enforcement that I needed to pass on to the sheriff (preferably immediately), and sometimes had a bit of advice for Sam Walton (even though I repeatedly reminded her that I was not likely to bump into him along life’s highway).</p><p class="calibre_9">Frankie loved to talk and was always in a happy mood. I can almost guarantee the person you’re imagining right now, with the type of personality required to be a greeter at <a></a>Walmart, is pretty accurate. Her liveliness and commentary consistently brought a smile to my face, and she slowly but surely taught me patience.</p><p class="calibre_9">Life moved on. My children grew older and their taste in toys became considerably more expensive. But there was always a reason I needed to go to Walmart, and Frankie was always there at the door. Until she wasn’t. She had been gone for about a week when, for a reason I don’t fully understand, I decided to look in a section of the local newspaper I rarely visit: the obituaries. There she was.</p><p class="calibre_9">My wife always has a sense of what the right thing to do is. She suggested the right thing to do was to go pay my respects at Frankie’s visitation. I did not even know Frankie’s last name until I read the obituary, and I certainly did not know anything about her family. But my wife said I should go, so I went. I drove to a small funeral home in a rural part of our county. There weren’t many cars in the lot, and there was no line, making me think I was at the wrong funeral home or had the wrong time. But I followed the signs down the hall and found the room with Frankie’s casket. There were only a handful of people standing around. No formalities. No service—or not that night at least. I paid my respects and left shortly thereafter. It struck me as sad that so few other people were there. I don’t know what I was expecting, but it was different from what I saw.</p><p class="calibre_9">I wish I had spoken to the people there that night. I wish I had talked about the way Frankie approached strangers with <a></a>friendliness and humor, the way she built relationships in one-minute intervals as people were passing through what she called “her door.” Her legacy influenced the way I view strangers and even the way I view small talk. It’s actually not always so “small,” in hindsight, at least to those with whom you are talking. There are pearls of wisdom in the brief encounters we have in life, and there is never a wrong time to make others feel valued.</p><p class="calibre_9">The truth is, legacy lasts far beyond the words spoken or left unspoken at your funeral. Your closing argument isn’t just found in what people say—or how many speak up—about you, but in how you made them feel. Frankie’s closing argument was built from the decision she made every day to show up with a smile, her decision to engage with people some might call strangers, and to remind them of the importance of slowing down and prioritizing human connection. She decided to try to make the world a better place the best way she knew how. She made people feel welcome, and that is one of the best feelings you can give someone.</p><p class="calibre_9">I still think of Frankie frequently when I pass a Walmart. I actually think of Frankie far more often than I do the man who started Walmart. Her memory reminds me to slow down, that it’s okay to smile from time to time and not always be in such a hurry. Life is not a hundred-meter dash. It’s okay to talk with the people we are walking this marathon with. I wonder how many other Walmart shoppers were impacted by <a></a>Frankie the way I was. I bet if they knew she’d passed away, there would have been a larger crowd at the funeral home that night. But the size of the audience often does not equate to the quality of the performance.</p><p class="calibre_9">If you judge success by public adoration, media attention, fame, wealth, awards, or titles, then I guess Frankie would not be considered wildly successful. If, on the other hand, you measure life—the accumulation of the decisions you make—according to the longevity and significance of what is remembered even by a few, then I would say Frankie is still alive and well.</p><p class="calibre_9">You cannot script with precision what’s going to happen in the end, but by thinking through what you <span class="italic">want</span> to be said of you, how you <span class="italic">want</span> to be remembered—whether it’s said at your visitation or memorialized in a book years later—it will give you direction on whether to start, stay, or leave when you find yourself at a crossroads.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">The Note You End On</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When writing the closing argument for that first murder trial, there were a number of different angles to choose from. We had hundreds of pieces of evidence. What did I want the jury to be left with? Would it be the fingerprint found in Ricky Samuel’s Bible? Would it be the symbolism of taking a man to accept Jesus and then putting two bullets in the back of his <a></a>head, ensuring that he did, in fact, meet Jesus? Would it be the testimony of co-conspirators? Would it be the motive of wanting to eliminate a witness? How could we close this case in the most effective and persuasive way possible?</p><p class="calibre_9">I decided to end with a simple, single photograph of the crime scene.</p><p class="calibre_9">In this photograph, you had the benefit of simplicity, of imploring the jury to simply exercise its collective common sense. Picture the scene in your mind as it was depicted in this still photograph: A young man’s lifeless body lay mere feet away from a small pond with grass and trees on the periphery. The only evidence contained in that photograph was the body itself. The perpetrator was not in the photograph. The murder weapon was not in the photograph. But that photograph was powerful nonetheless. The loneliness was powerful. The inhumanity was powerful. The weakness of the federal government to protect its own witnesses was powerful.</p><p class="calibre_9">In this photograph there was a reflection off the water of that small pond. The surrounding grass and trees mirrored in that body of water. What if those actually were our witnesses? What if the grass and trees could testify? What would this photograph say if the photograph could speak to us?</p><p class="calibre_9">Indeed, it is speaking to us. It is telling us what happened if we will only listen. That photograph had the water needed for a manufactured baptism. It had the isolation needed for a crime. It had the anonymity someone not from the area would want and need. It had the absence of traditional witnesses. <a></a>Photographs do not have failed recollections. They are the perfect distillation of a specific time and place. And in that regard, they are the best witnesses you could ever have.</p><p class="calibre_9">Who had the motive to kill Ricky Samuel? Who were the new faces in his life who could lure him to a small body of water miles removed from where he called home? Who did he trust enough to get into a car with and search for a proper baptismal pond? If you could rewind this photograph from when it was taken to when the image was actually created, who do you think would be there? Whose reflection would we see in the pond? And don’t you think the reflection from the pond belongs to the same person whose fingerprint was found in the book of Ezekiel?</p><p class="calibre_9">Since this was the first murder trial I had ever been part of, I experienced the raw and acute feelings of loss, finality, and loneliness attendant to homicide cases. Seasoned homicide investigators and litigators may eventually grow accustomed to these feelings, but they were brand-new for me, and more importantly, these feelings would be brand-new for the members of the jury. I knew that in order to win the case, I needed my closing argument to appeal to both logic and these raw emotions that would deeply resonate with the jury, the observers, the final decision makers. Throughout the trial, knowing I wanted to end with the photograph, I emphasized the inhumanity of the murder and the events preceding it, and I appealed to the humanity of the jury, empathizing with the emotions that the facts of the case conjured.</p><p class="calibre_9">Something terrible, tragic, and lethal happened by that pond, even if there was no one there to witness it. The absence of human perception does not obviate reality. A life was taken even if there was no one left among the living to tell us who did it.</p><p class="calibre_9">There are always questions at the end of a trial, no matter the amount of evidence produced. People are wired to ask questions. We are, in some ways, wired to see doubt both in ourselves and in others. The photograph allowed the jury to ask all the right questions as they were deliberating. And employing reason, probability, and common sense as they went through the evidence and the testimony would provide the answers to those questions.</p><p class="calibre_9">Bob Harry Fowler and Tommy Pabellon were convicted by a federal jury in Greenville, South Carolina, and given four life sentences for the murder for hire of federal witness Ricky Samuel. I have lost count of the number of homicide cases I prosecuted after Ricky Samuel’s. But I never lost sight of the tactic that worked, at least for me. Start at the end. What is the last point you want to make, and how can everything else you do and say empower you to make that argument?</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_4"></div>
