But first, your most important decision will determine what success looks like in your life. Define success in terms of what you can control—your words, your mindset, your effort. The small decisions we make every day matter: choosing to use respectful language when you get in an argument with your boss, deciding that you are going to be optimistic about the outcomes of the projects you are working on, opting to read this book rather than watch TV, planning to go on dates with or give gifts to your significant other to show you care. When you decide to control your daily actions, you can derive your sense of fulfillment from active choices you make rather than only outcomes, a more stable and sustainable way of approaching success.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="calibre_14"> </span></blockquote><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Pyramids and Tall Orders</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">When I was growing up, my father would regale my three sisters and me with stories about Judge Donald S. Russell, the <a></a>man for whom the federal courthouse in my hometown of Spartanburg, South Carolina, is named. Judge Russell was someone I admired in large part because of his extraordinary résumé. I met Judge Russell only once, so it was his known accomplishments that I was most familiar with. He was the governor of the state of South Carolina, the president of the University of South Carolina, a United States senator, a United States district court judge, and a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, to name just a few.</p><p class="calibre_9">My dad’s favorite Donald Russell story was that on Saturdays in the fall, Judge Russell would ride from Spartanburg to Columbia with his family for University of South Carolina football games. Once in Columbia, the family would drop Judge Russell off at a library or a park so he could read while the rest of the family went to the football game. Talk about misplaced priorities! Who would possibly pass up a chance to watch a Gamecocks football game to go read yet another book?</p><p class="calibre_9">I think the obvious point of my father’s story was that Judge Russell highly valued education, both formal and otherwise. The point could also have been that South Carolina was not very good at football back then, so Judge Russell found the library or a park bench more entertaining. If Judge Russell could still value education and reading, even at that point in life, having accomplished all that he had accomplished, surely I would be wise to value it more during my formative years. Education was not a target for Judge Russell—<a></a>it was his process. It was not merely something to be obtained—it was something to be experienced. I understood full well the point of my father’s story. I just did not apply those lessons to my own life—not then, at least.</p><p class="calibre_9">For a long time, Judge Russell’s résumé and reputation set the standard for what I believed a successful life should look like. I should accumulate one professional accomplishment piled on top of another—each step narrowing the path until some pinnacle is reached. Life is a pyramid and the goal is to get to the very top. That is what he had done and that is what I should strive for.</p><p class="calibre_9">The pyramid model of success goes something like this: You are born on the bottom of the pyramid. Most of us are expected to do certain things like graduate high school or avoid interactions with the criminal justice system. For those “accomplishments” you receive no credit, save that your pyramid remains largely intact. This is the base of the pyramid; it does not distinguish you from others—it simply keeps you in the game, like the opening ante in a poker match.</p><p class="calibre_9">From there on, each of your decisions becomes a building block in the pyramid, narrowing your path and scaling the heights even as the walk becomes more precarious as you go. Your vocational pursuits become steps toward the top—each promotion elevating and distinguishing you even more. Any awards and recognition you receive during your life will help to build your pyramid, separating you from others who may have similar career paths and goals. Finally, at the top of the <a></a>pyramid is a lasting legacy, a reputation that lives on even after you’re gone, like having a courthouse named after you. To reach the top of the pyramid is to achieve uniqueness in the purest sense of the word. It indicates that you have done or accomplished things that have not been duplicated by others.</p><p class="calibre_9">Based partly on Judge Russell’s example, growing up—and well into adulthood—I’d ask myself: What does the top of my pyramid look like? How am I going to distinguish myself? How many things have I done that others may not have done? I thought I could prove my uniqueness only by doing things others viewed as laudatory or exceptional. It was an exhausting way to go through life.</p><p class="calibre_9">The education part of my pyramid was pretty thin and flimsy. I remember getting the yearbook my senior year of high school. There was a page dedicated to the “Ten Most Outstanding Seniors,” the students who had stood out the most academically, athletically, and otherwise. You will not find my name on that page of our high school yearbook—or any other page, for that matter, aside from the obligatory class photo, which is sort of tantamount to a participation award. Though I tried to carve out some semblance of a significant existence, my desire for success was overwhelmed by my fear of failure. It’s really hard to achieve much of note if you never venture or try. Part of you says to go for it, while the rest of you says you will likely fail. And the result was what I perceived as nothingness: no impact, nothing to distinguish myself by. When I received that yearbook in homeroom, I turned <a></a>through the pages and I saw failure. Anonymity and failure.</p><p class="calibre_9">Our son graduated from the same high school I graduated from about thirty years after I did, and there he was on the page of “Outstanding Seniors.” The base of his pyramid was already looking different from and much better than his father’s. But he eschewed that definition of success in life. I doubt he even opened his yearbook, and if he did, I can safely assure you it was not to judge whether he achieved high school fame. Even though he accomplished far more than his father had by that stage, it was inconsequential to him. He, smartly, does not use a pyramid to define a successful life, nor does he allow the editors of a high school annual to determine his worth.</p><p class="calibre_9">But I did then, and I did even after high school. Life went on, and I viewed every new day as just another opportunity to distinguish my existence from that of others. I determined that what I had not accomplished with my decision making in high school and college, I would have to make up for with subsequent decisions. I clerked for a district court judge. Some other people did that too, but not all other people. Then it was off to the United States Attorney’s Office. There have also been plenty of women and men who clerked for federal judges and went on to become federal prosecutors, but the pyramid was at least getting thinner in my mind. Add to that running for political office, first as state district attorney and later in Congress. With each new endeavor, I was trying to add points of differentiation or distinction that to outsiders <a></a>would make my pyramid look like a life well spent.</p><p class="calibre_9">Looking at the top of the pyramid may sound like a less morbid way to picture the end than thinking of the receiving line or wake preceding your funeral. You might say it’s just another way to start with the end goal in mind. But I have found the pyramid to be a faulty model. If you live your life in an effort to be distinct from everyone else, you will live for an external title or reputation rather than an internal purpose or aspiration. You will be relegated to a narrow path. What would life look like if we accepted our uniqueness from the beginning and stopped trying to prove it?</p><p class="calibre_9">Often life handcuffs us with a definition of “success” imprinted in our youth, and we can never seem to outrun it. For me, this pyramid, combined with an innate fear of failure, set an unattainable and exhausting definition for a well-lived life. But for years I couldn’t shake it. While I don’t blame the honorable Judge Russell for my unrealistic benchmark for success, his expansive résumé and substantial reputation left me feeling substandard and inadequate no matter my age or what I actually did achieve.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Climbing Ladders</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Another popular model of success is a ladder, with every rung representing incremental achievements and increasing power or worth. The ladder is a metaphor typically used to describe <a></a>professional achievements—as you get promoted, you continue to climb. It’s commonly referred to, not surprisingly, as “climbing the ladder of success.”</p><p class="calibre_9">I have a few friends who see success according to the ladder model, and some of those people have their sights set on the very top rung of the ladder, as in the most powerful position in the country and, arguably, the world: president of the United States of America.</p><p class="calibre_9">According to the best estimates, 545 million people have been born in or moved to the United States of America since we became a country. There have been forty-six presidencies in that time period, with forty-five different men (for now) having held that position. (As you may recall, Grover Cleveland was president twice but not successively, so we will count him once.)</p><p class="calibre_9">Based on firsthand knowledge alone, I can currently think of no fewer than twenty-five women and men who are considering a run for president in 2024 or beyond. Even more, there are 100 United States senators, 50 governors, 435 members of the House of Representatives, and dozens of ambassadors and cabinet-level officials. It is safe to assume that many of them aspire to be president. And then there are the entertainers, television commentators, radio talk show hosts, and others who believe that they, too, would make a fine leader of the free world.</p><p class="calibre_9">So a lot of people aspire to—and perhaps even define <a></a>success as having—a job where the chances of “being hired” are less than the odds of winning the Mega Millions lottery or, to put it more pointedly, being struck by lightning while cashing in your winning lottery ticket.</p><p class="calibre_9">The ladder model is dependent upon outperforming and outachieving other people. First, that’s not always possible, and second, that leaves a lot of people behind or falling off. All of those aspiring presidents will not be “unsuccessful” in their lives simply because they do not achieve something incredibly difficult to achieve. There must be worth and purpose somewhere besides the top rung of this ladder. There has to be more to life than simply looking and climbing up, not to mention the fact that the higher up the ladder you climb, the farther people get to see you fall.</p><p class="calibre_9">When I reflect on my friends who are contemplating running for the highest office in the land, or running for governor of a state, or whatever is perceived as the highest echelon of their chosen field, I feel the urge to ask them what I am asking you: Do you want the measure of what you accomplish in life to be marked by titles, offices, and achievements? Or do you want what you accomplish in life to be defined by the fight itself, the venture, the challenges, the pursuits that you deemed worthy of your time? Is success what you do or who you are?</p><p class="calibre_9">Of my current friends who look in a mirror and see a potential president of the United States, perhaps one, if he or she is lucky, will ever “succeed” in my lifetime. Most of them will <a></a>not even be the nominee of their political party. But that cannot possibly mean that these women and men are failures. My hope for them, and for you, is that they will consider themselves a smashing success simply because they ventured, they tried, and they competed.</p><p class="calibre_9">It’s a matter of perspective. So, if we can find a way to shift our identity from what we have achieved to what we have ventured to do, then we can begin to make better decisions for ourselves. And if we are able to shift our identity—the measure of our own worth—from what we have ventured to do to who we have ventured to become, not in terms of title but in terms of character, then we are able to view success not from the top of a ladder but from the throngs of a fulfilled life, surrounded by friends and family and full of aspirations, ventures, and careers we loved.</p><p class="calibre_9">You can fall off a ladder or a pyramid. Interestingly, the higher you have scaled it, the more painful the fall. Both perspectives on success make shifts in direction seem akin to failure. If you decide to change paths, both models imply that all the work up to that point has been pointless and you are starting at the bottom again. If you decide ten years into your career in insurance that you want to be a romance writer, then you will go back to ground zero—like a terrible game of real-life Chutes and Ladders.</p><p class="calibre_9">I would encourage you to eschew both the pyramid and the ladder for something much more likely to get you to your <a></a>desired closing photograph and summation.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Man in the Mirror</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">In 2015, during my third term in Congress, there was a window of opportunity for me to run for the Speaker of the House of Representatives. There was a path, albeit small, to victory. John Boehner was stepping down. Kevin McCarthy, the clear favorite, had withdrawn from consideration. Paul Ryan was being cajoled to run, but his real desire was to stay where he was as the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. So, there was this highly coveted title, with no perceived front-runner, and hence there was a path. That would have certainly helped me build the next level of my pyramid: Speaker of the House, third in line to the president. It might even make up for not appearing on the Outstanding Seniors page of the high school yearbook.</p><p class="calibre_9">Should I start or should I stay? Should I run for a position that presents itself infrequently, if ever? Should I seize that moment to do something no one ever thought me capable of doing? Should I shock every teacher I ever had? Could I forgive myself if I had a life-changing opportunity within arm’s reach and then decided to withdraw my arm? The pyramid mentality said, “Start. Go for it.”</p><p class="calibre_9">But by that point, I had thankfully traded the lure of a <a></a>unique pyramid for the steady assurance of a mirror. I no longer felt the need to be different or successful in the eyes of everyone else. I no longer needed a title to set me apart. I simply felt the need to be successful in the eyes of a few, and mostly in my own eyes when I looked in the mirror.</p><p class="calibre_9">It is hard to pinpoint the precise moment I scaled this mountain of change and swapped my external calibration of success for an internal one. From an early age I confused what I did with who I was. I confused what I accomplished or failed to accomplish with my sense of worth. Ironically, I did not do this to others. One of the kindest things I ever heard my father say about me was, “Trey treats the man who owns the building the same way he does the man who cleans the building.” And my dad was right—I did try to do that with almost everyone. Except myself.</p><p class="calibre_9">Once you accept that there is at least one person in the world who genuinely does not care whether you work in the Capitol or manicure the lawns around the Capitol, you can be freed. You can be liberated. That one person for me is my wife, Terri. Throughout our life together and because of the love she’s shown me, I was able to distance myself from the pyramid model I’d always subscribed to. I jokingly say that I am not even sure my wife knew I was in Congress for eight years. It’s just not how she judges me or my worth to her or our children. For her it is your character, not your accomplishments. It is how you act, not what you achieve. Attention and notoriety <a></a>never meant anything to her. The two men she respected most in life were her father and her brother, and it was not because of anything either of them did, it was because of who they were. It is liberating when you find someone who values you for who you are rather than what you accomplish. And it is even more liberating when you finally begin to listen to that person.</p><p class="calibre_9">It is most liberating when you become that someone for yourself.</p><p class="calibre_9">I went from scaling the pyramid to looking in the mirror when Terri handed me the keys that let me out of that self-styled prison. Someone else can unlock the door of that prison, but you must affirmatively decide to walk out and leave. It’s not that I didn’t care anymore about what others thought of me. I did care, to a point. But I was no longer a prisoner of what others thought. I have accepted that my pyramid will look pretty much like everyone else’s when my time is called. Even if it were distinct, I’ve realized that few people who matter would notice or care.</p><p class="calibre_9">The path of my life no longer needs to be an ascent for me to define it as successful. I now look in the mirror (metaphorically—you don’t get a hairdo like mine by spending a ton of time in front of a mirror) and ask myself: <span class="italic">Will I be making this decision for myself or for others? Will this cause a rift in the relationships and things that bring me joy in life? Will I see my family less or not be able to play golf with my son and my friends as often? Does this decision take me on a path that leads me closer to my desired closing argument, to that final photograph in life’s pictorial? Will I enjoy and find purpose in the reality of this decision (the day-to-day work) or just the concept of it (the title and prestige)?</span><a></a></p><p class="calibre_9">In the case of my opportunity to run for Speaker of the House, when I had the chance to start something new, my mirror said, “Stay.” I had no desire to do all the different work required of the Speaker. I did not want to travel every weekend, trying to help colleagues who had short memories and might not appreciate my help anyway. I did not want to populate committees or referee fights or be responsible for herding the cats in the various factions within the larger Republican conference. The job would not have suited me, nor me it, and the title—any title at this point—had lost its allure.</p><p class="calibre_9">With the mirror model, success—the definition of success and the actualization of that success—comes from within. Success is not an external monument of your achievements that you’re constantly building; rather, it is a practice of self-reflection and inner fulfillment enabling you to make decisions that echo your desired path.</p><p class="calibre_9">Now, when people ask me for advice about building a successful life, I tell them the story about the pyramid, the ladder, and the mirror. I tell them the three key ways the mirror is superior (though there are more):</p><ol class="calibre_17"><li value="1" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">It doesn’t relegate you to a linear track. The mirror recognizes that as you change and grow, so do your dreams and plans. You can still be successful if you decide to change career paths twice over two decades.</blockquote></li><a></a><li value="2" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">It enables you to find satisfaction in the phase of life you are currently in. This enables you to be more present and to celebrate and rest in accomplishments for a time.</blockquote></li><li value="3" class="calibre_18"><blockquote class="calibre_6">It focuses on the opinions of those who matter. Rather than collecting external titles and achievements, the mirror empowers you to fixate on your purpose and character—internal pursuits—and look to the opinions of those who know you best. You can see others in the mirror—especially those closest to you—and take their reflections into consideration, but your success isn’t dependent upon anyone else’s perception, performance, feedback, or praise.</blockquote></li></ol><p class="calibre_9">Life will not unfold in a straight line. You may start your career as a prosecutor and end up in television. You may major in history because it means less time in the classroom and then find yourself not only getting a law degree but also standing at the front of the classroom, teaching college and law school classes. So long as you look directly to the person in the mirror, you will be able to see more clearly the direction you should go.</p><p class="calibre_9">So, as I ask myself and others who come seeking counsel, I will ask you too: What do you see in the mirror? And do you like it?</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">What to Look For</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">Now, some of you might be thinking that I only changed my perspective on success after I’d already climbed, built, and ascended the pyramid. I was a congressman, after all, so it must have been easy for me to say that external accolades don’t matter when I’d already achieved what others might deem a successful life. And you’re not wrong.</p><p class="calibre_9">If someone had presented me with a different model of success when I was younger, I don’t know that I would have followed it. I would like to think so, but I’m not sure. I am certain my mom or someone else tried to convince me earlier in life to be the best person I could be and let everything else fall into place after that. The concept of unconditional positive regard, untethered to acts or achievements, is hardly new. But it is difficult to change our thinking when we have been conditioned by others or external factors or culture to see and define success a certain way. It takes time to look at the faults and flaws of our current models and begin to deconstruct them. It takes time to learn the same old lesson that those things do not bring contentment. It takes time to trust ourselves as credible decision makers and definers of our own success. But once I was able to do that, I found myself wishing I had arrived at that place much earlier in life.</p><p class="calibre_9">To define success for yourself, look in the mirror, reflect on your past decisions, and ask yourself some questions: When have you felt most fulfilled and satisfied? What have you done <a></a>in your life that filled you with a sense of purpose? When have you decided to be or do something solely for someone else, and what were the effects that had on you? Of everything you’ve built and done in your life, what are you most proud of? Have you ever thought an achievement wasn’t worth the sacrifice? Whose opinions matter most to you, and why? Have you ever made a decision for the benefit of your image in others’ eyes? How did that turn out? Was there any joy, and if so, how long did it last?</p><p class="calibre_9">All of these questions can help you build your own definition of success. And it’s important to remember that everything you’ve built up to this moment is not wasted or left behind; it is informing what you see when you look in the mirror.</p><p class="calibre_9">What you decide to do in life may still look to others like the standard ladder; you may achieve success in the world’s eyes. But let that be an ancillary benefit, not the goal. My father either did not want me to attend the University of South Carolina undergrad or he forbade me to apply, depending on whose version of the facts you adopt. That is, in a real sense, how I wound up at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. My father did not want me to attend South Carolina even though he had, and he loved that school with all his heart. He was probably right. I would not have done well being around high school friends for those four years. So off to Texas I went. But I did make it to South Carolina’s law school, which was at the time the only law school in the state, so that was sort of a <a></a>combination of necessity and opportunity. In May 2022, I made it back to the University of South Carolina for one final commencement exercise. The president and the board of trustees gave me an honorary doctorate for public service. To be clear, I did not and do not deserve it, but I am going to keep it anyway.</p><p class="calibre_9">I did not take my parents with me to the ceremony. I did not tell them about it ahead of time. I had to work my tail off to convince my wife to stay home. I don’t think I even mentioned it to my children. I did not care then, or now, whether anyone else knew about it—except my parents, after the fact. That was my goal—to make up for the mediocrity that prevented me from getting an undergraduate degree there earlier in life by returning later in life and getting an honorary doctorate. So there I was onstage, sitting a seat away from the president in between the chairman of the board and a past chairman of the board, both of whom were from the area my parents grew up in. That was why I went, for my parents. Because it meant something to me to do something for them. Although being called Dr. Trey sounds a lot like Dr. Dre, which is pretty cool too.</p><p class="calibre_16"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">Carve Your Path</span></span></p><p class="calibre_9">I used to feel an enormous amount of awe and pressure when I thought about Judge Russell. I pictured him on top of a pyramid when, in reality, he was sitting on a park bench <a></a>reading a book during a football game. If we focus too much attention on artificial measures of success, we can lose sight of the most important thing, which is the people themselves. Now when I think of Judge Russell, I picture him reading peacefully in a park, enjoying the fullness of a football-less life. Sure, others named a federal courthouse after him, but he wasn’t sitting in that eponymous courthouse reading a book. He was sitting on a nameless park bench. That is what he valued. That is what I should have seen when I thought of him all along.</p><p class="calibre_9">Your reasons to start something new shouldn’t be dependent on anyone you can’t see clearly in your mirror. Your decisions do not always need to make sense to everyone else. They should, of course, be carefully considered and rooted in rational thought. But it is your life, and you only get one—and when you only have one of anything, you should treasure it and be a good steward of it.</p><p class="calibre_9">What you find significant and how you define success will likely not fall in line with what others deem significant or successful. That can be an apt measure of good decision making. Carve your own path, look in the mirror often, and don’t get distracted by the ladders and pyramids that others are trying to convince you to climb or construct.</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_5"></div>
