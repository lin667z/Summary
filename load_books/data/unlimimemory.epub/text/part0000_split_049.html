<h2 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_108"><span class="calibre13">Success</span></h2> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">To </span><span class="calibre5">laugh often</span><span class="calibre6"> and much; to win the respect of </span><span class="calibre5">intelligent people</span><span class="calibre6"> and the </span><span class="calibre5">affection of children</span><span class="calibre6">; to earn the </span><span class="calibre5">appreciation of honest critics</span><span class="calibre6"> and endure the </span><span class="calibre5">betrayal of false friends</span><span class="calibre6">; to appreciate </span><span class="calibre5">beauty</span><span class="calibre6">, to find the </span><span class="calibre5">best in others</span><span class="calibre6">; to </span><span class="calibre5">leave the world</span><span class="calibre6"> a bit better, whether by a </span><span class="calibre5">healthy child</span><span class="calibre6">, a </span><span class="calibre5">garden patch</span><span class="calibre6"> or a redeemed </span><span class="calibre5">social condition</span><span class="calibre6">; to know even one life has </span><span class="calibre5">breathed easier</span><span class="calibre6"> because you have lived. This is to have succeeded.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Once you have found your keywords, the next step is to create images out of them and place it on one of the systems that you have learned in this book. </span><span class="calibre5">Remember it is like your imagination is the pen and the system is the paper.</span><span class="calibre6"> You can use a journey, your body, a car or anything that is already in your long-term memory. You can even link all the concepts together like you did with the presidents. Let me get you started; let’s use a tree to remember the key concepts. Why a tree? Because it represents growth for me, and it is in your Long-term memory.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Imagine the roots </span><span class="calibre5">laughing</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre5">intelligent people</span><span class="calibre6"> (you can imagine Einstein) are sitting at the base of the tree. Imagine </span><span class="calibre5">children</span><span class="calibre6"> hugging the trunk of the tree (affection of children), and on the branches you can imagine </span><span class="calibre5">a nest (honest) full of critics</span><span class="calibre6">. You will notice that we have connected the first few key words to your system, and with a bit of repetition you will have it all in place.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you choose, you can continue to connect the rest of the information to the leaves, thorns, and the fruit or to a park where the tree is planted. Once you have the key concepts then you need to read through the material a few times. The key words will make the text ‘stickier’ and your knowledge of English will help you to remember the syntax. Make the material come to life and you will remember more!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">My friend, the late great Creighton Carvello, memorized Ernest Hemingway’s novel </span><span class="calibre15">The Old Man and the Sea</span><span class="calibre6"> and each word's numerical position. For example, you might have asked him the 6th word on Line 15 on Page 8 and he could name it. He did not use rote learning; he used a method similar to the one I have just shown you.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Like with anything in life it takes a bit of practice to be able to remember text with ease. When you master this, you will be able to remember any information that you need for your business or your life word-for-word. Actors have also successfully used this method to remember their lines. When you really know the information, you can feel and act it out more comfortably as well.</span></p>
