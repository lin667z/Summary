   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Do you have a little voice that talks to you in your head? If you are not sure, you are probably asking yourself, "Do I have a little voice or don't I?" We all have a little voice, and it has a huge influence on our concentration and our lives. You are constantly talking to yourself but the only problem is that you catch yourself doing things wrong. </span><span class="calibre5">Start to catch yourself doing more things right.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">How or where did you concentrate well today? In what area of your life do you need to stop ‘beating’ yourself up?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Your inner voice has the ability to offer instructions so instruct yourself well. It is the center of your focus of control that helps you explain and make sense of your world. Don’t agree with the wrong voices; all self-hatred and conflict is just a thought or a little voice… so change the thought. It is not set in stone. Remember: if you give yourself bad commands, then bad things will happen.</span></p>
