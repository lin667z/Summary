   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Elbert Hubbard said, </span><span class="calibre15">“Self-discipline is the ability to make yourself do what you should do, when you should do it, whether you feel like it or not.”</span><span class="calibre6"> When people want to start a task that they have to complete and say something like, “I will do this tomorrow” a loop closes in their mind and they are happy to continue without doing it… because they will do it tomorrow. The problem is that when tomorrow comes the same loop just repeats itself. Or if you say, “I just don’t feel like it” a loop closes because you have tricked yourself into thinking that you will do it when you do feel like it. These pictures and voices, that we control, create our feelings. If you want emotional mastery learn to take control of these pictures, movies, and voices that you run in your mind.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Some people say, “I have to listen to my inner voice because it guides my intuition.” Listen to your intuition or feelings when you are deciding to pass a truck on a busy road, making a massive decision or whether you should climb into an elevator with a freaky looking guy. But when you are following a discipline these feelings only get in the way. If you have to floss your teeth, you don’t have to consult your intuition, you just do it. When you have to exercise you don’t have to listen to your feelings, just do it. William James said, </span><span class="calibre15">“The more we struggle and debate, the more we reconsider and delay, the less likely we are to act.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Schedule a time in the day for memory training and practise – whether you feel like it or not.</span></p>
