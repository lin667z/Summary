   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">With this method we connect the name to the place where we meet the person. We are using a journey peg to hold on to the name. Let’s say we meet a woman by the name of Rose. Ask yourself, “What will I remember about this place where I meet her?” Let’s say you think you will remember the buffet table, you then connect a big red rose to it and when you think of the place you will think of her name.</span></p>
