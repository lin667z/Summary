   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“The great breakthrough in your life comes when you realize that you can learn anything you need to learn to accomplish any goal that you set for yourself. This means there are no limits on what you can be, have or do.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Brian Tracy</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">What would your life be like if you could learn and remember information easily, quickly, and effectively? Think about it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In this short, easy-to-read book I will provide you with a set of powerful memory-enhancing mindsets and skills, which will allow you to take control of your learning and your life. You will discover many amazing methods, both ancient and new, that have been modeled from the world’s best minds in the areas of accelerated learning and memory development. This book will give you information that school forgot to teach you. The approach is all about running your own brain; I believe that this can only be possible with the foundation of memory.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Imagine if you were born without a memory. Who would you be? You would be nothing; if you don’t have a memory, you don’t have anything else. If I ask you, “Who are you?” you would immediately start rearranging memories in your mind to answer that question. Your memory is the glue that binds your life together; everything you are today is because of your amazing memory. You are a data collecting being, and your memory is where your life is lived. If you didn’t have a memory, you wouldn’t be able to learn, think, have intelligence, create, or even know how to tie your shoes. You wouldn’t be able to build experience in any field because experience is just a collection of memories after all! </span><span class="calibre5">Only if you can remember information can you live it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Over the years, memory has been given a bad name. It has been associated with rote learning and cramming information into your brain. Educators have said that understanding is the key to learning but how can you understand something if you can’t remember it? We have all had this experience: we recognize and understand information but can’t recall it when we need it. For example, how many jokes do you know? You’ve probably heard thousands, but you can only recall about four or five right now. There is a big difference between remembering your four jokes and recognizing or understanding thousands. Understanding doesn’t create use: only when you can instantly recall what you understand, and practise using your remembered understanding, do you achieve mastery. Memory means storing what you have learned; otherwise, why would we bother learning in the first place?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Some people say you don’t need a good memory in the Google age. Ken Jennings said, </span><span class="calibre15">“When you make a decision, you need facts. If those facts are in your brain, they’re at your fingertips. If they’re all in Google somewhere, you may not make the right decision on the spur of the moment.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Which raises the question: would or have you hired a person for his or her ability to Google information? No, you want people with information and experience at their fingertips. You want confident people, people that are certain about what they know. Not storing information in your mind is expensive and can lead to embarrassment and poor judgment. If you have to continually refer to notes or manuals to do your work, you will waste time and look unprofessional. Would you rather buy a product from someone that forgets your name or from someone that remembers it? Would you allow a doctor to operate on you if she had to continually refer to a manual or an iPad? Definitely not!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Memory is the corner stone of our existence. It determines the quality of our decisions and, therefore, our entire life!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Learning and memory are the two most magical properties of the human mind. Learning is the ability to acquire new information, and memory holds the new information in place over time. Memory is the foundation to all learning. If memory is not set in place, all you are doing is throwing information into a deep hole never to be used again. The problem is that many people are not recalling what they know, and they are constantly learning and forgetting, and learning and forgetting, and learning and forgetting…</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When you improve your memory, you improve everything. You can access information more quickly and more easily – creating greater opportunities for connections and associations. The more facts and memories that you have properly stored in your brain, the more potential you have to make unique combinations and connections. An increased memory also enhances basic intelligence because intelligence is based on all of the events, people, and facts that you can recall. The more you remember, the more you can create and do because factual knowledge always precedes skill. Information can only be built onto more information, so the more you know the easier it is to get to know more.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now, with your memory you have two choices. The first choice is that your memory cannot be improved; you can do nothing to make any difference to your in-born ability. Many people choose this as their life’s choice because through the thousands of hours of schooling, not one hour is spent on showing you how your amazing memory can be made better. School never told you anything about your amazing brain.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When I was eight years old, a school psychologist gave me a bit of advice about my brain. He said I may have a form of brain damage, and he wanted to send me to a special class. I was a classic dyslexic: I wasn’t born with a good memory, and I couldn’t concentrate; reading and writing were always a challenge for me. Throughout my school career, I learned by having my mother and friends read the syllabus to me; I forced myself to memorize it and what I didn’t get, which was most of it, I just didn’t get. I had no future because I just couldn’t grasp what was being taught to me. In twelve years of school, I couldn’t read a book from cover-to-cover alone and in my final year of school, I still couldn’t read much better than when I started out in First Grade. To cut a long story short, I somehow managed to graduate from high school in 1989.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">A couple of years later, my life was changed when I was walking through a local bookstore. Up until that point, I had not read a book from cover-to-cover by myself, but that night I decided to buy three books. They were all written by Tony Buzan. The first book was </span><span class="calibre15">Use Your Head</span><span class="calibre6">, the second </span><span class="calibre15">Use Your Memory</span><span class="calibre6">, and the third </span><span class="calibre15">The Speed Reading Book</span><span class="calibre6">. Back then, I honestly thought I would begin with the speed reading book and then read the other two quickly. However, it didn’t work out that way. I started reading </span><span class="calibre15">Use Your Memory</span><span class="calibre6"> and discovered that we all have a second choice. This choice is: our memory is just a habit, and habits can be improved with the right kind of training and practice. I discovered that there are basic fundamentals to memory improvement and that if we apply them consistently, we will get the same results that great memory masters do. If we don’t, we won’t. I started studying psychology and anything I could get my hands on in the areas of the brain, mind, and memory. I studied hundreds of books and tapes, and I also interviewed people with great memories. Through this long journey, I overcame all of my dyslexic issues and took myself to a point where I was reading and taking in, on average, four books a week. I could learn in an hour what took the average person months to master.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In 1995, I decided to compete in the World Memory Championships. This is an event that attracts the best memory masters from around the world, and the competition tests every facet of memory. That year I managed to come fifth overall, having won second place in the written word event. This was proof that I had overcome all of my dyslexic challenges. I was also awarded the title ‘International Grandmaster of Memory’ by the Brain Trust: a title, which was presented and jointly sanctioned by His Serene Highness Prince Philip of Liechtenstein, on October 26th, 1995 at Hanbury Manor in Ware, Hertfordshire, England. Considering my past difficulties and from where I had come, this was a great achievement. From that day on, I knew my life had changed direction, and it would never be the same again.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In 1999, I decided to stretch myself and test my abilities even more when I broke the world record that has been called ‘The Everest of Memory Tests.’ I memorized the first 10,000 digits of Pi – Pi has passed every test of randomness and has no known limit. The first 10,000 digits of Pi are divided into 2000 5-digit blocks. The testers would call out any one of these 5-digit sequences, and I had to reply with the 5-digit numbers on either side of the number chosen. This happened 50 times. The record was for the time taken to complete the test; I broke the previous record by 14 minutes. Why did I do it, you ask? Mainly because people said it was impossible to do, and that’s what my life is all about: breaking limitations and showing people what our memories are capable of.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Ever since then, I have been training, teaching, and coaching people to remember key information that they need for their lives and that the joy of learning is available to us all. Many people say I have a photographic memory, but that is not true. I have just discovered many ‘secrets’ about memory, and I have been able to use and make these methods my own.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I don’t tell you all this to impress you but to impress the point that every person has the same potential to master his or her memory. It doesn’t matter where you come from; all that matters is where you are going. However, if you keep on doing what you have always done, you are going to get what you have always gotten. You need to </span><span class="calibre15">do</span><span class="calibre6"> different to </span><span class="calibre15">get </span><span class="calibre6">different. Thus, a word of warning: mastering your memory is going to require a different kind of thinking.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Don’t judge or look for perfection from this book; rather look for value. When you judge information, you stop yourself from learning it. You can judge the methods, you can criticize them, you can try another approach, but I promise you, you will not be able to get the same results as us memory masters without applying these principles. I ask you to read with an open mind; I have no doubt that everything that you will learn in this book works and works amazingly well. The methods that I will share with you are the same methods that memory masters use. This is the strategy!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You will see that this book is broken up into three sections covering the four keys (or Cs) to improving your memory. The first section talks about improving your </span><span class="calibre5">C</span><span class="calibre6">oncentration. The second section is about improving your ability to </span><span class="calibre5">C</span><span class="calibre6">reate imagery and </span><span class="calibre5">C</span><span class="calibre6">onnecting concepts together, and the final key is about creating a habit with </span><span class="calibre5">C</span><span class="calibre6">ontinuous use. These four Cs are the solution to any memory problem that you have or will face in the future. Some of the examples that I have used in this book come from personal development and business books so not only will you learn to improve your memory, but you will also learn some key concepts that you can use for your personal development.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I will teach you to transform bland information into something that is real and well organized. This, in turn, means the information has meaning and will then be used instead of being discarded. I am not talking about rote learning but a way to store information differently with far better results. The goal is to improve learning and understanding.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There are many books out there that do a lot of talking before you find any meat. This book is different; I want to get straight to the point and save you a lot of time and energy. It is my goal to show you the wonderful world of memory improvement in a way I wish someone would have taught me. Don’t just read this book; play with the concepts and make it part of your thinking and your life. If you are ready, then turn to the first lesson and unleash the power of your memory.</span></p>
