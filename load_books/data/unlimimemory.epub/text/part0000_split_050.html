   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“The human brain is a wonderful organ. It starts working as soon as you are born and doesn’t stop until you get up to deliver a speech.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ George Jessel</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Do you enjoy watching a presentation where the presenter hides behind a piece of paper or a screen and reads all the information to you? No, you want to see a human being, making eye contact and communicating freely.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The purpose of any presentation is to get your audience to understand, believe and act on what you say. If you as a presenter can’t remember your own content, how is your audience meant to remember it? If they can’t remember it, they are not going to believe or act on it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Many people are afraid of public speaking. I believe that the fear has a lot to do with the fear of forgetting information. Many people say, “I might hit a blank.” The methods that you have already learned in this book will provide you with a solution. If you work with the methods you will never ‘blank’ out again.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I have been giving professional presentations for fifteen years now and the last thing on my mind is the fear of forgetting information. When I present I use the memory strategies and the information is always there waiting for me to deliver it. I can also clearly remember jokes, slides, research, points that other people have said, and all my prepared content. I can loop back to any questions asked and be certain in my delivery. When you really remember the information, it builds confidence and you will look like you know what you are talking about. </span><span class="calibre5">Presentation power is memory power.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You can eliminate the fear of forgetting by using memory methods like the journey, body, car, peg list, drawing your own pictures or making mind maps. Take charge and control of your content, because without notes you will look more professional in your delivery. When you present with the memory methods it is like you are reading from a teleprompter. You are not learning the information word-for-word but you are clearly remembering the structure.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you don’t move an audience you are not managing your content correctly. Great presenters know that audiences tend to remember the first and last bits of the presentation. Therefore they make their introduction and conclusion powerful and outstanding. They make their introductions more outstanding by opening with a memorable demonstration, question, fact, quote or a meaningful story. They also continually link information to the audience, making it more outstanding and keep repeating the main points. You can design your presentation with this FLOOR principle in mind. In a presentation we tend to remember:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">F</span><span class="calibre6"> – First things</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">L</span><span class="calibre6"> – Last things</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">O</span><span class="calibre6"> – Outstanding information</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">O</span><span class="calibre6"> – Own links</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">R</span><span class="calibre6"> – Repeated information</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you use this principle you will get your audience to remember more – making your presentation more enjoyable.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you have a clear structure installed in your head, it will be easier to move your audience, you will look more confident and you will be a much more powerful presenter.</span></p>
