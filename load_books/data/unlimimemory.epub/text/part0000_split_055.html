   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“We all love to win but how many people love to train?”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Mark Spitz (7 Gold medals in the 1972 Olympics)</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There has never-ever been an undisciplined world champion. Our rewards are always directly proportional to our efforts. It sometimes takes years of training to develop abilities in the area in which we would like to achieve success. People say, “That person has such a talent,” but they never look down the road to see how many hours have been spent training. If you want to master the skills that you have learned in this book, or if you want to master anything, you need self-discipline. </span><span class="calibre5">Self-discipline is not self-deprivation. It is about raising your standards and going for and being more.</span></p>

Why don’t people do it?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">People simply don’t do it because they think that the future will be a better place than today, without doing anything to make it better.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">What do you want? What are you doing daily? If your daily actions are not moving you in the direction of what you want, then you will never get what you want. Common sense, isn’t it?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">It is not that your goals are physically impossible; it is more that you lack the self-discipline to stick to them. There are four keys to creating more self-discipline in your life and the first one is:</span></p>
