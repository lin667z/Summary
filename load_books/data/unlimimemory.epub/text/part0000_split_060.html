   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“You know as well as I do that it is entirely wrong to assume that any subject matter which we once learned and mastered will remain our mental property forever.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Bruno Furst</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">It has been estimated that two years after leaving school, the average person only remembers three weeks’ worth of lessons. Think about it in your own life. Do you still remember all those theorems? That means that after twelve years all you have left is three weeks. The average person that passes a test today would never pass that same test four weeks later. Final exams are really final!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In Spritzer’s experiment it was found that the average person who learns textbook material (without memory methods) remembers only the following:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">After 1 day:54%</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">After 7 days:35%</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">After 14 days:21%</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">After 21 days:19%</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">After 28 days:18%</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The above shows that the average student only remembers 18% of their work after a 28-day holiday. That means the lecturer or trainer only has 18% of the knowledge to build new knowledge onto. The average company or student loses 82% of the information or 82 cents out of every training Dollar after twenty eight days. Any training is a waste of time if there is not a process of review!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Many people feel that they can never forget the information that they learned using the memory methods and systems. The memory methods make the learning process fun and more effective. They create such a strong impression and it is so different to your mind that you have to remember it, and consequently it sticks. The methods help to store the memory quickly for a medium term, but to make sure that the information remains in your mind you need to review and recite it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The reason we review is to make the information more solid in our minds. The only way we can build on a memory is if we can remember it. Your memory is like a bank: the more you put into it the more it grows. Review also helps you to create more long-term memories.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Repetition or rote learning on its own (without the methods) is no fun; it takes long and can often result in an aversion to learning. Memorizing should be a pleasure; it should be more like a game.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Reviewing when using the memory methods doesn’t require a lot of time. It is just a process of thinking about it, and making sure that the pictures are strong and that you can clearly see them. Then recite any information that you want to stick in your mind.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I have found that if you review your information in a specified time frame you increase recall. If you repeat it after ten minutes of learning the information it will remain in your memory for at least an hour. The first review should always be done backwards. Reviewing images backwards helps you to remember them more effectively.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you learn concepts in reverse you create a new impression in your mind and this makes information more outstanding. It just seems to make the memory so much stronger. Once you have done this, you review at longer and longer intervals: </span><span class="calibre5">review after 1 hour then 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 21 days, 28 days, 2 months, 3 months and then it should be in your memory forever</span><span class="calibre6">. During the first 72-hour period the knowledge transfers into a deeper stronger memory. So if you are using a route or journey system, after the first 72-hours you will be able to reuse the journey for new information. However, if you have information that you want to keep forever, rather assign it its own route or system and review it often.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Review takes discipline, but it keeps information fresh in your mind. It keeps it alive. It keeps it awake so that you can connect more information to that existing information. The more that you connect to that information the stronger the information becomes. Your mind is the only computer in the world with this characteristic: the more you put into it, the more it will hold.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The perfect way to learn is to make lots of firsts and lasts by having lots of breaks, make your information outstanding, make your own links (using memory methods) and then you review it to keep it ready in your mind for new learning.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">No matter how many times you memorize something, you will have to start over from the beginning if you let yourself forget it. You have to spread out your revision over longer and longer periods of time. If you use it you will strengthen the information, and you will remember it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When you review, it helps you to think more about what you are remembering. By thinking about it you begin to really understand it too. It is important to use this information when remembering names. Only if you review them are you going to remember them. If you use the information often it acts as a review. You either use it, or you lose it from your instant recall.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You should </span><span class="calibre5">always use the power of review to put a lid on your learning to prevent your learning from escaping</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We have learned that the only way that you improve is to get rid of anything that is </span><span class="calibre5">preventing</span><span class="calibre6"> you from improving. So we got rid of the blocks to your mind like excuses, limiting beliefs and learning to single task, and then we became more </span><span class="calibre5">willing</span><span class="calibre6"> to learn more. Then we learned </span><span class="calibre5">how</span><span class="calibre6"> to improve through the SEE principle of imagination. We have learned the different memory methods – the link story method, memory art, the body and car method, the route or journey method, the peg systems, the number code, and remembering names. These methods are only limited by your own imagination and level of self-discipline. We now also know how to review.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Remember to review to renew.</span></p>
