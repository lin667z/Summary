   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Dale Carnegie</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There is no such thing as a good or bad memory for names, there is only a good or a bad strategy. In this chapter you are going to learn strategies that can make a huge difference to your name memory. Make a commitment today to improve; it is a commitment that will provide you with numerous benefits and save you from many embarrassing situations.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In Chapter 3, I showed you the self-fulfilling circle. Get rid of your limiting beliefs about your name memory and start to focus on finding a strategy that can help you. Become motivated and interested in names and how we brand people according to that name.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Imagine you meet a person and they say that they will give you a million dollars if you could remember their name a week from today. Would you then remember it? Of course you would. We are all brilliant at names if we are motivated enough to hold on to them.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The methods that I will be sharing with you have been used for centuries. They require you to think differently and to use your incredible associating mind. Some people say that they have tried association to remember names and it doesn’t work for them. It doesn’t work if you don’t practise, nothing in life works unless you work with it. All the memory champions are using association methods and can easily remember about a hundred names in less than half-an-hour. I believe that if you copy the strategies of the champions you can get the same results and if you don’t you won’t.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The untrained memory is not very reliable. The average person leaves their memory to chance, hoping that the name will somehow stick. The strategies that I will share with you work – use them!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now if you want to remember names like a memory master you have to focus on the four Cs.</span></p>
