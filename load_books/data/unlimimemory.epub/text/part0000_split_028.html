   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“The music of your life is far better played with all the fingers of your Multiple Intelligences performing their magic on the keyboard of your existence.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Tony Buzan</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The quote you have just read was taken from Tony’s book called </span><span class="calibre15">Head First</span><span class="calibre6">. In his book he talks about how we have at least ten intelligences. We don’t just have one way of being ‘clever’ but at least ten and probably more. I like to remember these intelligences to remind myself how incredible we all are and to focus on improving them daily. But before I get ahead of myself, let me demonstrate how to remember these intelligences with another system. It is called, </span><span class="calibre15">The Body Method</span><span class="calibre6">. It is similar to </span><span class="calibre15">The Car Method</span><span class="calibre6">, but this time we are using parts of our body to store the new information. Your body is another great long-term storage compartment; you are in it every day and you know it well. There are plenty of storage compartments that you can use, but for demonstration purposes I’m only going to use ten places.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">With this method we are going to place ten key bits of information on our body. The information is a bit more abstract, it will require you to think more creatively, so let’s give it a go.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The first place that we are going to store information on is our feet. The first intelligence is </span><span class="calibre5">Creative</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence. So I want you to imagine that you are standing on a big bright </span><span class="calibre5">light bulb</span><span class="calibre6"> (a light bulb always reminds me of creative ideas), and it is burning your feet. To strengthen the association you can also imagine you are painting a beautiful work of art on your feet.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">On the second place, your knees, we are going to store </span><span class="calibre5">Personal</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence. Now imagine a big </span><span class="calibre5">Purse</span><span class="calibre6"> (sounds like Personal) on your knees. Create a bit of action with this picture; imagine opening the purse on your knees and your knees come flying out of it. Personal intelligence is about taking responsibility, so own the purse on your knees.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The next storage compartment is your thighs. Here we will store </span><span class="calibre5">Social</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence. Imagine people having a big </span><span class="calibre5">Party</span><span class="calibre6"> (Social) on your thighs. Really SEE the party and feel it happening on your thighs now.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The next place is your belt or hips, and we will store </span><span class="calibre5">Spiritual</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence there. Imagine a beautiful </span><span class="calibre5">angel</span><span class="calibre6"> on your belt, or that the angel is buckling your belt for you (Angels remind me of spirituality). Now review all the previous images from your feet to your hips. The words are Creative, Personal, Social, and Spiritual.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Next is your </span><span class="calibre5">Physical</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence and we will store it on your stomach. Imagine you get </span><span class="calibre5">physical</span><span class="calibre6">, start doing sit ups and your stomach all of a sudden becomes muscular; it becomes the perfect six pack.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Imagine in your left hand your </span><span class="calibre5">Sensual</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence. Here you can imagine a snotty nose, ears, and eyes to remind you of all of your </span><span class="calibre5">senses</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Then in your right hand place </span><span class="calibre5">Sexual</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence – here you can make up your own picture.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now let’s review quickly, we have: Creative, Personal, Social, Spiritual, Physical, Sensual, and Sexual.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The next place is your mouth. Imagine big bright colorful numbers flying out of your mouth (</span><span class="calibre5">Numerical</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence). Or, you can only speak in </span><span class="calibre5">numbers</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">On your nose, SEE a space ship landing on your nose and forehead (</span><span class="calibre5">Spatial</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence.) Or, SEE a </span><span class="calibre5">space ship</span><span class="calibre6"> flying up your nose.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Finally, on the top of your head imagine writing words on your hair, or your hair starts talking (</span><span class="calibre5">Verbal</span><span class="calibre6"> intelligence.)</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Let’s review The Body List:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">The Creative and Emotional Intelligences</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">(Legs create motion; that is to remind you that the Creative and Emotional intelligences are stored on your feet and legs.)</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">1. Creative intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">2. Personal intelligence (self-knowledge, self-fulfillment, and understanding self)</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">3. Social intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">4. Spiritual intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">The Bodily Intelligences</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">(All stored on the biggest part of your body, on your torso.)</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">5. Physical intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">6. Sensual intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">7. Sexual intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">The Traditional IQ Intelligences</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">(The head intelligences.)</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">8. Numerical intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">9. Spatial intelligence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">10. Verbal intelligence.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Tony Buzan says we are now entering the intelligence age, so it is vitally important that you know more about your amazing intelligences. The Body Method also helps you structure the information so that you can easily jump in and out of the material. When you read </span><span class="calibre15">Head First</span><span class="calibre6">, the body list will act as a powerful memory matrix that will attract more information and improve your understanding and recognition of the content. If you hear any other list of intelligences, like Howard Gardner’s, you can easily slot the information into its relevant compartment. When you hear people discussing IQ you will also immediately know (remember) that IQ only tests three intelligences – the head intelligences.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre15">“Most of us have been taught to think that we are either intelligent or we are not. But the definitions of intelligence we learned at school were built around the specific types of intelligence that are most valued at school – verbal intelligence and numerical intelligence.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre15">~ Paul McKenna</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The Body Method was originally invented by the ancient Greeks. You can use this method to remember information for exams, work, shopping lists or any list of information. You can even use it to remember things when you don’t have a pen at hand, like when you are in the shower. I just used ten places as an example, but you can use your back, your ears, eyes, nose… you can use it all. Just make sure you connect the two in a humorous way (remember the SEE principles), and that you remember the order. I have been able to use this method to remember fifty bits of information. I like to use this system to remember information so that I can consistently look at the information and have it at my fingertips.</span></p>
