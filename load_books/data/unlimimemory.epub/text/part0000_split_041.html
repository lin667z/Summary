   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“Interest level is measured by how much you remember.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Philip A. Bossert</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In this chapter, I want to show you the power of turning information into art. All of the systems taught in this book can be enhanced by turning them into a drawing, painting or picture. When you use more of your creativity you will be using more of your memory. It is a very simple method – you take information and you simply turn it into some form of art, and the information is remembered forever. It grabs your attention and your mind won’t let go.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">As I have said before, every word is a picture drawn with letters. Every word can conjure up an image that can be drawn, and pictures register very quickly in the brain. If an image can be presented in 3D it adds to the visual impact because that is the way things appear in the real world. You can achieve this by using Google images, by getting an illustrator to make you drawings, you can cut out pictures from magazines, or you can just use doodles. Any art can help you to remember more. You can sculpt your information; you can paint it, or even act it out. The whole process is about creative remembering and becoming more associated and personally involved with the information.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Use the power of Google images to create memory diagrams. Place all the images in a Word or PowerPoint document and view it often, so that when you look at the picture it creates instant learning. Let me give you two examples - the pictures below are not professionally drawn it is just a whole bunch of Google images placed together to make a linked picture. Have a look at the pictures and see how much registers in your mind. Link the pictures in a story and it will create an even stronger connection. The more deeply you think about any information, the more you will remember it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">This picture below is a memory diagram of the twelve cranial nerves that emerge directly from our brain:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <img src="../images/00016.jpeg" alt="Cran.jpg" class="calibre26"/> </p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The link starts with a picture of an </span><span class="calibre5">old factory</span><span class="calibre6"> (sounds like </span><span class="calibre5">Olfactory</span><span class="calibre6">). The second picture is a </span><span class="calibre5">tic</span><span class="calibre6"> to remind you of </span><span class="calibre5">Optic</span><span class="calibre6">. The third picture is a motor with ice blocks on it; it is an icy </span><span class="calibre5">cool motor</span><span class="calibre6"> (sounds like </span><span class="calibre5">Oculomotor</span><span class="calibre6">). The fourth picture is a </span><span class="calibre5">truck</span><span class="calibre6">, with </span><span class="calibre5">clear </span><span class="calibre6">written on it, which represents </span><span class="calibre5">Trochlear</span><span class="calibre6">. The </span><span class="calibre5">three gems</span><span class="calibre6"> are a reminder for </span><span class="calibre5">Trigeminal</span><span class="calibre6">. </span><span class="calibre5">Two cents</span><span class="calibre6"> for </span><span class="calibre5">Abducens</span><span class="calibre6">. A lady having a </span><span class="calibre5">facial</span><span class="calibre6"> is for </span><span class="calibre5">Facial</span><span class="calibre6">. </span><span class="calibre5">Vest</span><span class="calibre6"> for </span><span class="calibre5">Vestibulocochlear</span><span class="calibre6"> – you can always add more to the picture if the vest doesn’t trigger the whole word. The lip </span><span class="calibre5">gloss</span><span class="calibre6"> is for </span><span class="calibre5">Glossopharyngeal</span><span class="calibre6">. Elvis represents Las </span><span class="calibre5">Vegas</span><span class="calibre6">, so the word is Vagus. The earring is an </span><span class="calibre5">Accessory</span><span class="calibre6"> and finally the </span><span class="calibre5">hippo</span><span class="calibre6"> is for </span><span class="calibre5">Hypoglossal</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">These pictures are all short mental reminders or triggers to help you recall the main content. By looking, linking, and locking in the image you will make the memory link stronger and easier to recall. Try it!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The next example is a picture that will help you remember the first ten elements of the periodic table:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <img src="../images/00017.jpeg" alt="Elements.jpg" class="calibre37"/> </p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">First, we have a shiny red fire hydrant (</span><span class="calibre5">Hydrogen</span><span class="calibre6">) with helium-filled balloons (</span><span class="calibre5">Helium</span><span class="calibre6">) tied to the top of the hydrant. The helium balloons are touching the light bulb (</span><span class="calibre5">Lithium</span><span class="calibre6">). The light bulb is burning the different colored berries (</span><span class="calibre5">Beryllium</span><span class="calibre6">). The berries are being eaten by a smelly wild boar (</span><span class="calibre5">Boron</span><span class="calibre6">). A car with a bun attached to it (</span><span class="calibre5">Carbon</span><span class="calibre6">), crashes into the boar. Behind the car-bun is a knight (</span><span class="calibre5">Nitrogen</span><span class="calibre6">), and out of his armor pops an oxygen tank (</span><span class="calibre5">Oxygen</span><span class="calibre6">). The oxygen tank is being used by the man with flu (</span><span class="calibre5">Fluorine</span><span class="calibre6">). The spluttering and sneezing ‘flu man’ has a massive neon sign (</span><span class="calibre5">Neon</span><span class="calibre6">) that blinks on and off behind him.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Look at the picture again, make the links and it will be installed in your memory.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you wanted to remember the entire periodic table, you could create a few pictures and it will all be installed.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You can also use memory diagrams to help children remember spelling. Here are a few examples:</span></p>
