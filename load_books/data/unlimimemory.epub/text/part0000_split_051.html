   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“Is the object lost or are you lost?”</span></p>

   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Have you ever had this experience, you are sitting in your room and you think, “I’m going to make chicken for dinner.” You then walk to the kitchen and when you get there you think, “What am I doing here?” You may even open the refrigerator door, thinking the refrigerator will provide you with your answer. Or, have you ever parked your car and you can’t find it when you get back? Have you ever wondered if you had taken your vitamins or other medication? And don’t you just hate it when you put your car keys down and when you need them you can’t find them?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If any of this has ever happened to you, then you are normal. Yes, normal! This all happens because familiarity breeds forgetfulness. All of our routines sometimes create a state of ‘autopilot’ and we often don’t attend to what we are doing. The good news is that 95% of the time you are not absent minded. You remember where you put your car keys, you could find your car again, and you didn’t put your pants in the fridge. Yet we ‘beat’ ourselves up for the mistakes we make 5% of the time. If you keep your focus on your absent minded moments you are going to create more absent mindedness. </span><span class="calibre5">Start to catch your memory doing things right and you will start to see improvements.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">It has been estimated that people squander forty days annually trying to remember things they’ve forgotten. People are becoming increasingly absent-minded as they struggle to cope with constant streams of information from mobile phones, the internet, radio, and television. With all our technology and systems in place we should be more at peace but we seem busier and more stressed than ever. As a result, we are regularly misplacing items or forgetting people's names. We are living in an activity illusion and keeping our minds full of ‘busyness’ – no wonder we are absent minded. Making excuses for your absent mindedness doesn’t solve anything.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">So what is the solution? When you put items down, like your car keys, you need to bring yourself back to the present moment. Ask yourself questions like, “When am I going to use this next?” or say to yourself, “I am putting the keys on the table.” Or, you could imagine that your keys are exploding the table. Try anything different to bring yourself back to the moment. Most things in life can be solved with more responsibility and awareness.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In Chapter 4, I talked about being all there. When you start to single task instead of trying to do a hundred things at once, then you will start to be more focused. Take action today! Clear the clutter. Get organized; think on paper. Bruce Sterling said, </span><span class="calibre15">“Chaos is the sexiest excuse for laziness ever invented.” </span><span class="calibre6">Creating systems and using habitual places to put your items will save you massive amounts of time.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Do yourself a favor and stop trying to get attention for your absent mindedness. I hear you protesting, well why do you tell other people about these incidents if you didn’t get attention for it? Decide today to rather bring yourself back to the power of now and pay more attention to the moment.</span></p>
