   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“If you’re hoping to harvest a life of great deeds, remember you first have to plant some great seeds.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Denis Waitley</span></p>

   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You are the source of all your memories and </span><span class="calibre5">remembering is a choice!</span><span class="calibre6"> There is no magic when it comes to memory improvement; there is only management.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Memory skills are an important tool in your self-improvement arsenal.</span><span class="calibre6"> I have given you many tools, but remember </span><span class="calibre5">batteries are not included</span><span class="calibre6">. You need to provide the energy to make it work. The information you have received will change your life for the better… use it! Memory training will enable you to create more certainty with information. Certainty fosters confidence, and will give you a glimpse of your amazing ability.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Brice Marden said: </span><span class="calibre15">“The possibilities of thought training are infinite, its consequences eternal, and yet few take the pains to direct their thinking into channels that will do them good, but instead leave all to chance.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Today you have two choices. You can take the </span><span class="calibre5">first</span><span class="calibre6"> option: you can leave it all to chance and do what you have always done, but you will get what you have always gotten. Or, you can take the pains and decide today to take the </span><span class="calibre5">second</span><span class="calibre6"> option: do different to become different. Take these tools, make them your own, practise hard, and unleash the power of your memory.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“May you never forget what is worth remembering, nor ever remember what is best forgotten.”</span><span class="calibre6"> – Irish Blessing</span></p>
