   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“No memory is ever alone; it's at the end of a trail of memories, a dozen trails that each have their own associations.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Louis L’Amour</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In the previous chapters we learned to bring information to life, and to store it in a long-term memory compartment system. Now in this chapter we are going to learn to link more thoughts together. It is a way to direct attention and to strengthen your imagination and your ability to associate concepts. Your mind is an associating machine and it has no limits.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I often hear people say, “Oh, do you learn by association?” The answer to that is we only learn by association. Learning is connecting new information to old information, it doesn’t happen any other way. It is creating a relationship between the known and the unknown – and the more you know, the easier it is to connect more information and get to know more.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now let’s memorize a list together to experience this method. It will seem silly, but stick with it and I will make a point. This story takes longer for me to explain than what happens in your mind. Read it and remember to use the SEE principle.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I want you to imagine that you are </span><span class="calibre5">washing a tin</span><span class="calibre6">; really see it in your mind. As you wash the tin, it suddenly begins developing a huge </span><span class="calibre5">Adams</span><span class="calibre6"> apple. A </span><span class="calibre5">chef</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre5">her son</span><span class="calibre6"> grab the Adams apple and rip it out. The Chef and her son then decide to make some </span><span class="calibre5">medicine</span><span class="calibre6">, which they give to Marilyn </span><span class="calibre5">Monroe</span><span class="calibre6"> and she starts to develop a massive </span><span class="calibre5">Adams</span><span class="calibre6"> apple too. Michael</span><span class="calibre5"> Jackson</span><span class="calibre6"> sees her Adams apple throbbing and runs away screaming and jumps into a </span><span class="calibre5">van</span><span class="calibre6"> with </span><span class="calibre5">beer in</span><span class="calibre6"> it. The van is being driven by a big yellow </span><span class="calibre5">hairy</span><span class="calibre6"> </span><span class="calibre5">sun</span><span class="calibre6"> – really see it, make it silly, hairy, and let it stick. The hairy sun doesn’t drive very well and crashes into a</span><span class="calibre5"> tiler</span><span class="calibre6"> tilling his wall. The tiler’s tiles are </span><span class="calibre5">polka</span><span class="calibre6"> dot tiles. A </span><span class="calibre5">tailor</span><span class="calibre6"> takes the polka dots off and starts tailoring you a polka-dotted suite.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now recall the story and all the key words. If you didn’t get it all, read it again and make the links stronger. See if you can do it backwards too.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">What you have just learned are the first twelve presidents of the USA. You can continue remembering all forty-four Presidents just by linking one thought to the next. If you have any problems recalling the list just make it more outstanding and make the links clearer.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Here is the list of the first twelve Presidents:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">1. </span><span class="calibre5">Washing</span><span class="calibre6"> a </span><span class="calibre5">tin</span><span class="calibre6"> - Washington</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">2. </span><span class="calibre5">Adams</span><span class="calibre6"> apple - </span><span class="calibre5">Adams</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">3. A </span><span class="calibre5">chef</span><span class="calibre6"> and </span><span class="calibre5">her son</span><span class="calibre6"> - sounds like </span><span class="calibre5">Jefferson</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">4. </span><span class="calibre5">Medicine</span><span class="calibre6"> - sounds like </span><span class="calibre5">Madison</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">5. Marilyn </span><span class="calibre5">Monroe</span><span class="calibre6"> - </span><span class="calibre5">Monroe</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">6. </span><span class="calibre5">Adams</span><span class="calibre6"> apple - </span><span class="calibre5">Adams</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">7. Michael </span><span class="calibre5">Jackson</span><span class="calibre6"> - </span><span class="calibre5">Jackson</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">8. A </span><span class="calibre5">van</span><span class="calibre6"> with </span><span class="calibre5">beer in</span><span class="calibre6"> - </span><span class="calibre5">Van Buren</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">9. A </span><span class="calibre5">hairy sun</span><span class="calibre6"> - </span><span class="calibre5">Harrison</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">10. A </span><span class="calibre5">tiler</span><span class="calibre6"> (a person who lays tiles) - </span><span class="calibre5">Tyler</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">11. </span><span class="calibre5">Polk</span><span class="calibre6">a dots - </span><span class="calibre5">Polk</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">12. </span><span class="calibre5">Tailor</span><span class="calibre6"> - </span><span class="calibre5">Taylor</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Once you have the list in your mind go through it forwards and backwards a few times to make sure it is all there. You can also link more information to the list, so it becomes like a new peg list. You could link each vice-president to your presidents, just like we did with the foreign words and capitals. You can also connect your links or stories to some of the other systems that you have learnt. You can link more than one concept at a specific place or compartment on the car, body, pegs or journey method. This way you can remember thousands of words or concepts by connecting links to a short mental journey.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">It is so powerful because we use more of our creativity and imagination to make the information outstanding, therefore stimulating our interest and curiosity; keeping our attention at a peak. Each word reminds you of the next, you are making your </span><span class="calibre5">own links</span><span class="calibre6"> and you are only memorizing two things at a time. You can also use this method to memorize paragraphs of information. All that you have to do is condense everything down to a list of key words and then convert those lists into meaningful link stories. A whole syllabus or a book can be condensed into a ridiculous story. When you do this it is easy to remember, giving you a great mental workout and it is fun!</span></p>
