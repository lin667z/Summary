   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“The existence of forgetting has never been proved: We only know that some things don't come to mind when we want them.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Friedrich Nietzsche</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Have you ever had this experience, you smell something and instantly your memory takes you back to another time? The smell is a link to the experience. Or, you hear a song and a whole stream of memories are released from your mind?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We can consciously take control of this reminder principle to create another system for our memory skills toolbox. This is the first system that I ever learned, and it introduced me to my memory potential. It worked so well that it seemed like a trick and ever since that day I have been hooked on the power of my memory. I hope it has a similar effect for you. It is called, </span><span class="calibre15">The Peg Method</span><span class="calibre6"> of memory.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We are going to explore the power of your associative mind. We are going to learn two new peg methods of memory. The first is called </span><span class="calibre15">The Rhyming Peg Method</span><span class="calibre6"> and the other </span><span class="calibre15">The Shape Peg Method</span><span class="calibre6">. These secrets were brought to our conscious awareness by John Sambrook and Henry Heardson in the late 1700s.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">These methods are very simple and effective. It will provide you with a method that can help you remember 40 or more bits of information in a short space of time. You can even remember the information in random order and by number.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Let me explain the first method, </span><span class="calibre15">the rhyming pegs</span><span class="calibre6">. The pegs act in much the same way as clothes pegs. They keep information hanging around in your mind. The pegs themselves must become part of your long-term memory for them to work. Remember you always need your long-term memory to assist your short-term memory. With this method you associate new information to long-term memory pegs in your mind. The pegs also act as compartments or files for your new thoughts. The method is simple; it makes memory pegs out of rhyming words and we will use the following rhyming words as mental files:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">One rhymes with the word Bun</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Two– Shoe</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Three– Tree</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Four– Door</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Five– Hive</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Six– Sticks</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Seven– Heaven</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Eight– Gate</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Nine– Vine</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Ten– Hen</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now, each one of these pegs can become compartments to store new information. You link the peg (using the SEE principle) to the words that you want to remember.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In Anthony Robbin’s life changing book, </span><span class="calibre15">Awaken the Giant Within</span><span class="calibre6">, he has a list of The Ten Emotions of Power. I want you to use this new system so that you can hold these emotions in your mind. Think about them daily, because personal development only happens when you can remember what you need to act on.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">The Ten Emotions of Power are:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">1. Love and warmth</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">2. Appreciation and gratitude</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">3. Curiosity</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">4. Excitement and passion</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">5. Determination</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">6. Flexibility</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">7. Confidence</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">8. Cheerfulness</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">9. Vitality</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">10. Contribution</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Remember to make the images illogical. SEE the information in your mind for a few seconds. Take your time and make the associations strong; you can also draw an image to help you experience the information more.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">One bun</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine a heart (symbol for love) shaped warm bun, or imagine that thousands of warm hearts are flying out of a bun. Really visualize it and you will remember that one is </span><span class="calibre5">love and warmth</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Two shoe</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine that a preacher is grating a shoe with a cheese grater. I used a preacher to remind you of </span><span class="calibre5">appreciation</span><span class="calibre6"> and a grater for </span><span class="calibre5">gratitude</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Three tree</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine a cat in the tree, don’t make it logical. Maybe, imagine that the branches look like cats, cats are hanging off the branches or cats are growing out of the tree. Curiosity killed the cat. So, three is </span><span class="calibre5">curiosity</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Four door</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine an excited person bashing down your door. Or, the door is so excited it jumps up and down and opens and closes. You squeeze passion fruit on the excited door. Four is </span><span class="calibre5">excitement and passion</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Five hive</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine determined bees or determined terminators trying to break open a bee hive. Bees are a determined nation. </span><span class="calibre5">Determination</span><span class="calibre6"> is five.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Six sticks</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine hitting a flexible person, that is doing the splits, with a stick. Or, really feel how flexible the stick can be. Six is </span><span class="calibre5">Flexibility</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Seven heaven</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine heaven is full of confident people. See them walking tall with confidence that they are in paradise. Seven is </span><span class="calibre5">Confidence</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Eight gate</span><span class="calibre6">, see a smiley faced shaped gate. You cheerfully open the cheerful gate. Eight is </span><span class="calibre5">cheerfulness</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Nine vine</span><span class="calibre6">, see vitamins growing on a vine. As you eat these vitamin grapes you feel your sense of </span><span class="calibre5">vitality</span><span class="calibre6"> improve.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">Ten hen</span><span class="calibre6">, imagine a hen giving you presents. She is a contributing hen. Ten is </span><span class="calibre5">contribution</span><span class="calibre6">.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now really see each link picture in your mind and make it clear. You should now know these emotions forwards, backwards, and in random order. Test yourself to see if you have them all.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Practise feeling these emotions because you become good at what you practise. Anthony Robbins says, </span><span class="calibre15">“You are the source of all your emotions; you are the one who creates them. Plant these emotions daily, and watch your whole life grow with vitality that you’ve never dreamed of before.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">The rhyme method</span><span class="calibre6"> can be extended by finding more words that rhyme with the number, e.g.: one - bun, sun, tum, gum and gun. With this method you can easily create a peg system that you can use to store up to 30 bits of new information.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Pegging also has no limits; you can create other lists too. Here is the second short peg list that you can use, </span><span class="calibre15">The Shape System</span><span class="calibre6">. It converts numbers into concrete shapes. It works in the same way as the rhyme list, only this time the pegs are shaped like the number. We are not going to do an exercise with this system, because you have already learned the principle in the rhyme list.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Use this list on your own, to remember ten bits of new information, play with it and have a bit of fun. The shape method just gives you another option to use. Here is the list:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre20"> <img src="../images/00004.jpeg" alt="Numbers.jpg" class="calibre26"/> </p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">These peg lists create so many new possibilities; you can create all kinds of peg lists. You can use any list that is already in your long-term memory. You can make up words for each letter of the alphabet e.g. apple, bucket, cat, dolphin etc. Use any list that you already know well: your favorite football players, super heroes, pop stars or any list that you can remember in order. Enjoy using this method, and find new ways to improve it.</span></p>
