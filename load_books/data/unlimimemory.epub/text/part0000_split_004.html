   <p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">With this book, Kevin brings to life principles that can change your life forever. I say this with confidence because I have studied and implemented these methods in my own life. There are so many areas in your life and existence that can be transformed by these principles that I am honored to make such a small contribution to this amazing body of work.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">While studying to be a medical doctor, I didn’t know these methods and in academic performance I was an average medical student. I would spend many an hour battling through random bits of information while struggling to make sense of it. The question is not whether I made it or not but rather how much more efficient I could have been while working towards my qualification. The first time I encountered Kevin’s methods was while training to be a medical specialist. It has completely changed the way I now approach studying and how I now manage information – with a straight “A” academic record as added benefit. With this bit of information I sincerely compliment the author of this book. I did not suddenly change into some ‘intelligent being’; I decided to transform my perceptions about my memory. With this new-found structure and purpose, I managed to discover a potential within myself that I never thought possible.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">After realizing the impact of these principles in my academic life, I started applying it to my everyday life. What a journey this has been! The experience has been so much more than just learning to manage information; it ultimately enhanced my self-confidence, and the consequence of this cannot be limited to a specific area of my life.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">I am privileged to know Kevin personally and seeing the information written in this book evident in his life has been such a great source of motivation for me!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre18"><span class="calibre6">After many years of research, experience, and achievement, Kevin shares life-changing methods with us in an easy-to-understand and practical way. When you decide to utilize these methods and make them your own, you will unleash unlimited potential to not only improve your memory, but your life as well.</span></p>
