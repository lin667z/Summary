   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“Concentrate all your thoughts on the task at hand. The sun’s rays do not burn until brought to a focus.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Alexander Graham Bell</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We are all gifted: gifted with the power to think about our thinking. You can focus your thinking to improve any area of your life; you are in control of what you chose to attend. You can continue to allow your attention to be pulled by your environment, or you can decide now to direct it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Many people believe super concentration is a magical state with which only a lucky few are born. For instance, do you agree with this statement: big muscular biceps are something you are born with? No of course not because we all know it takes many hours of training in a gym. Yet, people look at attention as something you have or don’t have. Concentration, like anything in life, takes practice.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Concentration is made up of many small choices consistently practised. Everyday brain research is telling us that the brain is consistently changing when we learn something new. The people that limit their attention are still using the ‘your-brain-can’t-change’ model. We know that concentration can and should be improved. You have everything in you now to take control of your bouncing monkey mind and to take your power back.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Here is the average person’s daily attention training: they wake up in the morning, not peacefully, usually to some loud song or blaring alarm clock. They check their mobile phone for any messages, just to see if anyone missed them. Then they jump out of bed into the shower and there they think about a hundred and ten things that they need to worry about or need to do. Unfortunately, they haven’t allowed themselves enough time to get ready and can only manage a small unhealthy breakfast and fill up with coffee. They get in their car, put the radio on, make phone calls, or even try to text messages in the traffic. They get all angry, and they get all worked up about the traffic. The traffic is there and won’t change; yet, they think it should change. In fact, we worry and focus our attention on a ‘million’ things which can all wait for the appropriate time, but we allow our attention to be pulled in different directions.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Imagine your attention was an Olympic athlete. Would your athlete be able to be competitive? The reason our attention and focus isn’t that great is because we haven’t trained it. We keep on switching through the channels of our minds and never stop long enough on one specific channel. We pay attention half-heartedly on almost everything we do these days. We live in an activity illusion and think that ‘busyness’ is equal to good business. Busyness is sometimes just procrastination in disguise. Busyness may make you feel good and make you think you are more productive but when we look back at the end of the day we realize we haven’t done anything worthwhile. We are training our minds to have continuous partial attention, and our attention is being fragmented.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Training your concentration isn’t that hard. You just have to learn to become more peaceful and find the moment. You have to learn to be here now. When you are at work, be at work. When you are at home, be at home. </span><span class="calibre15">“Learn to be silent. Let your quiet mind listen and absorb,” </span><span class="calibre6">said Pythagoras.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We fill our minds up with all kinds of conflict, and this takes us away from the moment. Have you ever had a fight with someone at home, then you get to work, and the whole day you can’t concentrate? Conflict pulls your mind in many directions; when you fill your mind with conflict, your mind will be all over the place. </span><span class="calibre5">Conflict is the opposite of concentration.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When you are peaceful, you enjoy the moment and your mind becomes like a laser beam. Peace and concentration are the same thing.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There are four areas that you need to focus on to eliminate conflict and create more peace in your mind:</span></p>
