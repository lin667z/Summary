   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When people approach information they never really know what they want out of it. They don’t direct their minds. Learn to engage and be present with information by creating a strong </span><span class="calibre5">PIC</span><span class="calibre6"> in your mind:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">P</span><span class="calibre6">urpose: Have a clear purpose because clarity dissolves resistance. Always remember why you are reading or learning the information. Keep your purpose at the forefront of your mind. If you don’t know what you want, how are you going to know when you get it? Learning with a purpose increases your attention, comprehension, retention, and organizes your thoughts. The more specific the purpose, the more information you will get. A vague purpose would be: I want to learn more about memory from this book. A specific purpose would be: I want to learn at least six key strategies that will enable me to improve my memory. Focus on getting information that you can use – and then put it into practice. As David Allen said, </span><span class="calibre15">“If you’re not sure why you’re doing something, you can never do enough of it.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">I</span><span class="calibre6">nterest: Your level of interest sets the direction of your attention and, therefore, your level of focus. If you are not interested, remembering what you read will be almost impossible. Whatever is highest on your interest list is where your mind is alert, disciplined, and focused. Whatever is lower on your interest list is where you hesitate and procrastinate.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You can remember mountains of information when you are interested in the subject. It almost feels automatic and your concentration is at a peak. Your deficits of attention are mostly interest deficits. </span><span class="calibre5">Your mind never wanders away; it only moves towards more interesting things.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We all know that interest improves concentration but how do we get interested in the ‘boring’ information? The first step is to find your interests and then to find links or connections between your interests and the new information that you are learning. For example, I’m interested in training and sharing knowledge with other people. When I read anything I’m always searching for new information relating to my interest. When I read or listen through my interest filter, I am focused and I can concentrate. I always ask myself questions like, “How does this connect to training? How is it going to improve my life? If I read or remember this, is it going to give me something that not many people know? Is it going to help me in the future? How does this material help me achieve my goals?” In other words, all ‘boring’ information can be made more interesting with the right mindset. Gilbert Chesterton said, </span><span class="calibre15">“There are no uninteresting things, only uninterested people.”</span><span class="calibre6"> </span><span class="calibre5">So get interested!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre5">C</span><span class="calibre6">uriosity: Questions are the answer to improving curiosity. Before you start reading or learning, ask yourself motivational questions. Most people ask questions that don’t move them to take action. They look at the book and say things like, “Why do I have to read this book? This is too much to read. This looks really boring.” If you ask questions like that, how much energy are you going to have to learn? You want to ask energy enhancing questions that get you engaged in the information. Ask yourself, “How is this relevant and applicable to my life right now? How will this information help me achieve my goals? How can I apply this information to improve my work? How will this help me? How will this information make me more significant?” Get curious about your mind and how it works. Tony Robbins says, “If you want to cure boredom, be curious. If you’re curious, nothing is a chore; it’s automatic – you want to study. Cultivate curiosity, and life becomes an unending study of joy.”</span></p>
