   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you concentrate and get the name, then make it meaningful and connect it to the person, then this will enable you to remember the name for the short-term. However, to make the name stick in your memory forever you have to continue using it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Talk about the name. If it is a foreign name ask the person what it means. How do you spell it? Also use the name in conversation. The more you talk about the name the less you will be relying on working memory and you will begin to store it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">In your mind ask yourself, “What is that person’s name again?” Get the answer and then ask yourself, “Does that feel right?” Try to strengthen the association during the course of the day or evening.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Review the name. Create a names folder in your diary, on your computer or on your mobile phone of people that you would like to remember. Invite people you want to remember to one of your social networking sites, so that you can review their names. Review the names often to keep them in your long-term memory. It is just a question of writing the name down and where you met the person. Look at the list every now and again and you will have a massive name memory filing system, you will never be caught off guard for a name again.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You can use these methods to remember hundreds of people at one meeting. They are all designed to improve your focus of attention, because when you remember others they make a point of remembering you.</span></p>
