   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When you meet someone with the same name as you, do you remember their name? Yes, because you are interested in that name, you always hear it, and your attention is at a peak. The name has meaning to you and you also connect it to yourself. If you follow this basic strategy with every person that you meet you will remember their names.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When we get introduced to people they normally say their name so quickly that nobody can get it. Take control of the introduction, to be able to really get the name you have to slow down the introduction. Put your elephant ears on and really hear the name, make remembering names something that is important to you.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Oliver Wendel Holmes said, </span><span class="calibre15">“A person must get a thing before they can forget it.” </span><span class="calibre6">You need to really hear the name first, if you don’t hear something you will not remember it. You have to first get it to turn it into a memory. If you hear the name, and repeat it back to the person you will improve your recall. If you don’t hear the name, ask the person to say it to you again, and if it is a difficult name ask the person to spell the name too.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Listen and get genuinely interested in the other person’s name. We are normally so worried about being interesting, that we forget to be interested. When you become interested you will want to listen to the name. Learn to listen to people from their perspective and not your own. Not only will it improve your name memory, but your social intelligence too.</span></p>
