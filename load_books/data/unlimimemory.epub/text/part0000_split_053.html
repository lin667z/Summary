   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">“Learning new information isn't helpful unless it can be recalled later. Anything that increases one's memory power increases access to everything learned.”</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">~ Richard Restak, M.D.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There is no learning without memory. The more you can enhance your memory the better you will be able to learn. In every course there is some theory that needs to be remembered. The quicker you can get the theory down the more time you can spend on practising the information. Many of the first and second year University subjects are mostly memory based. If you have a strong memory system in place, you will succeed in anything that you choose to study.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There are a few things you should consider to enhance your performance in your area of study. First, never learn just to pass an exam. What is the purpose of doing well in an exam and not knowing what you have learned two weeks later? Learning is not a destination, it is a continuous process.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">All the ‘A’ students that I have ever interviewed prepare and plan their learning. They do little bits over time and don’t stress before the exam, because all the hard work has already been done. All the ‘F’ students overdose on energy drinks the night before and stress their way through the information hoping it will stick for the exam. So break your learning down and master the material over time.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Before you study anything make sure you have a strong PIC (Purpose, Interest and Curiosity) in mind. Review Chapter 4 to get more details on the PIC principle. Your vision will determine how much energy you will have for your learning and how hard you will be willing to work.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When studying it is also important to take breaks, as our mind can remain focused for only so long before we become unproductive and tense. When you return from a break you will feel refreshed and do more work in less time. Every 35 to 40 minutes take a break, take a walk and get away from whatever you’re working on and give your mind a rest.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Get an overview and analyze the material that you have to cover. Mark out all the areas that you need to remember. In any subject the same concepts keep coming up, so make images for these key concepts and create an image ‘vocabulary’. This is so that you don’t have to keep on finding images for information that you have already created. Then create a memory system that will work for each section and store the information. Record your systems and go through them a few times to make sure you have all the content in your head. I have had students that have used one shopping centre to remember their entire syllabus. Using the methods, shared in this book, you will never have the experience of not being able to get information into your head again.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">No matter what information you need to learn, these methods can be adapted so that you can find a solution and make the information ‘sticky’. I have helped thousands of people to learn all kinds of material for school and university. I have helped medical students, law students, pilots, policeman, nurses, medical reps, miners, ornithologists, marketers and engineers. There isn’t an area of study that won’t benefit from these methods. These methods have no limits; the only limits are the excuses and judgments that you may place on them with your whining mind. Some people say, “I’m not creative and I don’t make pictures”, when I hear people say that to me, all I hear is, “I’m too lazy to put in the effort”. If you choose to believe in limits you will live a limited life.</span></p>
