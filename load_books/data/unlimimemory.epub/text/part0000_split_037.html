<h2 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_82"><span class="calibre13">Face Connection</span></h2> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">With this method you make a link between the name and an outstanding feature on the person’s face. Every person’s face is unique and every face has an outstanding feature. Let me give you an example, imagine you are introduced to a woman and the first thing you notice about her face is that she has striking blue eyes. That will then be her outstanding feature. When she gives you her name you will then have a place to put the name. Imagine she says her name is Janice. You then make an image of the name: Janice sounds like </span><span class="calibre5">chain ice</span><span class="calibre6">. You then make the connection and think of a </span><span class="calibre5">chain</span><span class="calibre6"> of </span><span class="calibre5">ice</span><span class="calibre6"> flying out of her blue eyes.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Here is another example, imagine you meet a man and you notice that he has a big nose and his name is Peter. Turn the name into a picture; you can then imagine a ‘Pea eater’. Then quickly make the connection that his nose is a big pea eater. By making a silly memorable association you will connect the face and the name together.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">With this method never tell anybody what you have done in your mind. It is personal and some people may become offended. I remember once meeting a woman by the name of Hazel. She asked me how I remembered her name, so I told her… big mistake. I said I thought of a hazelnut. She was not impressed. Remember, most people identify with their names – they like it and consider it as their own unique brand. If you make fun of it you are making fun of them.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">A few questions that people ask about this system are:</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">What happens if I meet four people and all of them have an outstanding nose?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Searching for the outstanding feature helps you focus on the face as you may never have done before. Most people never really look at the person when they are meeting them. So the feature is more about directing your focus on the face and making a connection. I have done a demonstration where I have remembered over a hundred names in half-an-hour using this method. When you meet a hundred people you use many of the same features, but amazingly there is never any confusion. Go to Facebook to practise this method, there are millions of faces to choose from.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">Can I connect the name to the clothes of a person?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Yes, but only if you notice the person’s face too. People change clothes, but their faces are unique and don’t change much.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15">What happens if I find it hard to make a mental picture of the person’s name?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre15"> </span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You can imagine writing their name on their forehead. Make sure you use a big fat red mental pen. It is all about creativity. If you </span><span class="calibre5">create their name in your mind</span><span class="calibre6">, you will remember the name with as much ease as you remember the face.</span></p>
