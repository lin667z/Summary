   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">You have to create an image for the name in your mind, to be able to re-create it later.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Have you ever heard people say, “I know the face, but I can’t remember the name...?” You never hear people say, “The face is on the tip of my tongue”. We remember faces because they form an image in our mind. The names don’t normally ‘stick’ because we try to remember it with our auditory memory or our little voice. It doesn’t make sense to try to stick a sound to a vision – of course it won’t stick. Plus, auditory memories are never as solid as visual memories.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">To hold on to a memory we must make an image out of the name. Remember how we created images out of names when we learned the presidents? When you give a name meaning you can then hold on to it.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When you put a name into your mind and you don’t do anything with it, it will disappear and you won’t be able to find it again. This is because working memory doesn’t store information. So to store it you need assistance from your short and long-term memory. You have to really think about the name to remember it because </span><span class="calibre5">we only remember what we think about.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">When you are introduced to someone, you only have twenty seconds to think about the name and make an association. If you don’t do anything with the name in twenty seconds the name will be gone. The more connections and meaning you can give the name, the more it will ‘stick’.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Some of the names will naturally create a picture like the surnames Baker, Cruise or Gardner. My surname is Horsley so you can think of a </span><span class="calibre5">horse</span><span class="calibre6"> and Bruce </span><span class="calibre5">lee</span><span class="calibre6">. My first name is Kevin and it sounds like Cave in, making it easy to create an image and meaning out of my name. Other names may be more difficult, but by using a bit of creativity any name can be given meaning and turned into a picture.</span></p>
