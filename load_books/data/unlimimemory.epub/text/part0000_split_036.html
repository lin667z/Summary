<h2 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_81"><span class="calibre13">Comparison Connection</span></h2> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">With this method you connect the person to a name that you already know. Let’s say we meet a person by the name of George. To make the name stick, we think of someone that we already know with the same name. Do you know another George? You may even think of someone famous with the same name, like George Clooney.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Now all we do in our mind is compare the two people. What color hair does the George that we are meeting have? What color is the other George’s hair? By comparing this one feature you will be paying more attention than you would have before, therefore making a stronger connection.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Compare as many different features as you can and you will focus your attention and create a long-term impression for perfect recall. It is as simple as that… just compare the two faces in your mind and you will remember them. Impact your memory even more by imagining the person with two heads – their own, and that of the person you already know with the same name.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I like this method because it helps you to both remember the new person, as well as reinforce the other name too. This method only takes a few seconds to help you remember the person’s name forever. We are using the memory principle of taking a long-term name and using it to remember the short-term new name.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Some people ask, what happens if you don’t have a similar name to compare to? We can then use one of the other methods that I will be showing you now. Find a system that works best for you.</span></p>
