<h2 class="calibre12" id="calibre_pb_42"><span class="calibre13">2. Stop multitasking</span></h2> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We destroy our concentration by multitasking the moment and our peace away. Multitasking is a myth!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">If you watch a lioness hunting in the wild, she will focus on one wildebeest. She never focuses on two – because she knows the odds of missing both are stacked against her. She is single minded and does everything in her power to achieve her goal. In the circus when they train lions, they put a chair in front of their face to control their behavior. This confuses the lion and divides their attention. Now they have four chair legs to focus on, and they go into a type of trance. We humans are the same. Our brain can really only focus on one thing at a time. It is impossible to focus on two things at the same time. When you are multitasking, you are actually switching between tasks, you are always semi-attending, and it is not very effective. We cannot do more than one thing well at a time. It has become one of the most damaging myths out there.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We are training our brains to have an attention deficit. A lot of people simply cannot focus for an extended period of time anymore. I have heard that the average person looks at their mobile phone about 50 times a day. We are reading emails, the news, Facebook, and twitter etc., during what should be family and relationship time. People these days even drive while talking on a phone. Driving with a mobile phone makes you hit the brakes 0.5 seconds slower. If you are travelling at 112km per hour, in 0.5seconds you travel 15.5 meters... a lot can happen over that distance. If you are distracted in your car, you have a 9 times higher chance of having an accident. When your phone rings, you don’t have to pick it up... that’s why voice mail was invented!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Neuroscience consultant Marilee Springer says, </span><span class="calibre15">“Multi-tasking is known to slow people down by 50% and add 50% more mistakes.”</span><span class="calibre6"> Multi-tasking is like putting your brain on drugs. There is a whole body of research that shows that multitasking is less productive, makes you less creative, and contributes to you making bad decisions.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We are also not allowing ourselves to sit and enjoy the moment anymore. Blaise Pascal said, </span><span class="calibre15">“All man’s miseries derive from not being able to sit quietly in a room alone.”</span><span class="calibre6"> We get in the car, and we </span><span class="calibre5">have to</span><span class="calibre6"> put the radio on. When we arrive home we </span><span class="calibre5">have to</span><span class="calibre6"> put the TV on. When we watch TV, we flip through the channels. We even lack enough attention to watch the commercials. We are constantly filling our minds with conflict. Most people allow their attention to be pulled in different directions; very few people direct their attention. A lack of </span><span class="calibre5">attention direction</span><span class="calibre6"> is the real disorder.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Stop overwhelming yourself by continually changing the channels of your mind. Sharpen up your intellect by returning to the habit of doing one thing at a time. Rediscover the value of consecutive tasking, instead of settling for the quality dilution associated with simultaneous tasking. Exceptional work is always associated with periods of deep concentration. Nothing excellent ever comes from a scattered effort. When you are all there, your brain power and resources will be all there, too.</span></p>
