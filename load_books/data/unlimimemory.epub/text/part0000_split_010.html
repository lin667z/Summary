   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">There is just too much to learn.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">I have to change my thinking.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">The book requires me to do too much.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">It will be difficult.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">We excuse ourselves into living mediocre lives. We explain why we can’t do this or that; we excuse ourselves from taking responsibility. Decide now to stop giving away your power to your excuses.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Are your excuses true? Are you 100% certain that they are true? Do any of your excuses really enhance and empower your life? You are more than your excuses, aren’t you?</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Drop them now!</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Richard Bach said, </span><span class="calibre15">“Argue for your limitations and, sure enough, they’re yours.”</span><span class="calibre6"> The only cause for not doing something with the information in this book is you; nobody else but you. You are responsible for your learning. The person that has the most to do with what happens to you is you! </span><span class="calibre5">If you believe your limits, your life will be very limited.</span></p> 
   <p class="calibre9"><span class="calibre6">Improving your memory and concentration is not only about what you need to do more of; it is also about what you need to do less of. It is amazing how quickly you can learn a new skill when you decide to let go of your excuses, judgments, and complaints. If you consistently change your approach and increase your desire to learn this information, you will master it.</span></p>
