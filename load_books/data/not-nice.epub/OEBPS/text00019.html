<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Regardless of the origins, it appears everyone has an internal Approval Seeker. This is the part of us that wants people to like us, hates conflict, disconnection, and discord. This is the part that wants everything to be smooth, for everyone to get along, and everyone to love us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While this desire for harmony and connection is completely natural, it can become problematic. When we are being nice, we are usually identified with the Approval Seeker inside of us. Instead of it being just another part that’s influencing our feelings and behaviors, it becomes the only part. It’s driving the bus, determining where you go, what you say, and what you do. It begins to run your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When this happens, our primary goal in life becomes getting approval from others. Or, more specifically, avoiding disapproval from others. Because our Approval Seeker really has two missions it’s trying to carry out: a prime directive and a secondary objective, if you will. While achieving <span class="CharOverride-9">both</span>
 objectives is ideal, it is most important to achieve the prime directive before worrying about the secondary one. Here are the Approval Seeker’s objectives:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. Avoid judgment, criticism, dislike, and disapproval at any cost.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. Earn positive perceptions, feelings, and approval from others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Objective number one definitely outweighs number two. So, if you’re with a group of people you don’t know that well, you will do things to avoid disapproval first. This might include speaking when spoken to, smiling and nodding, being polite and agreeable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Perhaps loudly telling that funny story about your cousin getting sick on his fortieth birthday would be seen as hilarious and get you tons of approval from this new group. But maybe it wouldn’t. Maybe it would be awkward-city with tons of confused and offended looks. Not worth the risk. Just stick with the prime directive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Speaking of the prime directive, our Approval Seeker is looking to complete this mission with complete and resounding success. Total domination. When it says it doesn’t want <span class="CharOverride-9">any</span>
 disapproval, it means absolutely, positively, no disapproval.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here is the Approval Seeker’s typical list of success criteria for avoiding disapproval:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. <span class="CharOverride-10">No one has a negative thought or judgment about me.</span>
 This includes my appearance, my attire, my job and income, the way I speak or move, my actions or choices, or any other qualities about me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. <span class="CharOverride-10">No one feels any negative or uncomfortable emotions in my presence due to me.</span>
 No fear, discomfort, uncertainty, aversion, irritation, upset, confusion, or dislike.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">3. <span class="CharOverride-10">No one demonstrates any non-verbal signs of disapproval.</span>
 No one furrows their brow, curls their lip, or has any other physical sign of judging or disliking me. Only positive or neutral facial expressions must come my way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A perfectly reasonable set of goals here... Until our next interaction with a human being. With this unconscious criteria, and our Approval Seeker driving the bus, we’re screwed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How do you think this strong need to avoid all negative thoughts and feelings from others impacts you? Does it make you more relaxed or less relaxed? More confident or less confident? More powerful or less powerful? More yourself or less yourself?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s right, it’s going to make you a self-conscious, neurotic mess. Trust me, I know this first hand, having let my Approval Seeker run the show for more than fifteen years of my life. It will make you run all your nice person habits double and triple time. And don’t get me started if the person you’re talking to is beautiful, handsome, confident, powerful, or successful. Then it becomes even worse. Their disapproval is even more important to avoid because their perception means more than yours does. I mean, after all, they are a better person because they’re skinny, or muscular, or rich, right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Speaking of which, how does your Approval Seeker show up? What specifically do you do to avoid disapproval? Also, what do you do to try to win the approval of others?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This usually arises as an urge to impress others. Perhaps you try to appear very intelligent or highly knowledgeable about a particular subject. Maybe you play up experiences you’ve had, exaggerating a bit so others see you as exciting or cool. Maybe you name drop, or tell a certain story again and again because it makes you look important. These are just a few examples of the many subtle ways we try to earn the approval of others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One pattern I recently observed in myself was to earn approval through achievement. I noticed a hard-driving part of me that I call Double More (because it always wants me to do double and more of what I’m doing) pushing me to achieve more quickly. It was impatient to get to the next level and dissatisfied with my current rate of progress. When I explored why I needed to achieve more and faster, I found the urge came from a desire to impress others. Specifically my dad and one of my mentors.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Pay attention in yourself over the next few days to see how you might try to earn approval from others. While these behaviors are not highly problematic, they do pull you away from your authentic self, and subtly reinforce the idea that you are not worthy of love and approval right now, as you are.</p>
