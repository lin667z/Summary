<h4 class="Header-02">Death or Just Discomfort?</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">A big part of the intense guilt and uneasiness that occurs when we’re putting ourselves first is the fear that it is going to lead to the death of the relationship. Our nice programming taught us this little chain of logic: If you put yourself first (and others have negative feelings about it), then you’re selfish. If you’re selfish, then you’re bad. If you’re bad, then you’re not worthy of love and belonging until you “shape up” and “do the right thing” (i.e. become less selfish and put others first).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When we act against these dictates, a young part of our minds activates with fear and anxiety. Remember our brief discussion about attachment styles earlier in this book? Basically, part of us fears we’re going to lose connection with other people and end up being isolated and alone. Thus, acting in our self-interest will lead to the death of the relationship.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But is this really true? Will it lead to death, or just discomfort? Most of the time we never test it to find out what actually happens. As with most things in life, our fear and anticipation of terrible things is worse than what really occurs when we face fear and take action. Perhaps another person does get upset at something you say or do. Maybe they even get fired up and say something critical, or storm out of the room in a huff.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is the moment of truth. This is when your mind will want to race at 300 miles per hour, predicting the end of the world and life as you know it. You’re fired, dumped, friendless, penniless, and on death’s door. Panic. Freeze. Run after them and say whatever you need in order to make their upset (and your discomfort) go away.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or, pause. Breathe slowly in and slowly out. Notice the fear, panic, and restless energy in your body. Notice the dramatic stories and wild predictions of terrible futures. Stay right here in this moment. It’s just discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Your capacity to tolerate discomfort is one of the most valuable muscles you could ever develop. It will not only break you out of the cage of niceness into freedom, authenticity, and confidence, it will also help you get anything you want in life. Any skill, any level of career success, and even the best relationship of your life–it all comes back to your ability to tolerate discomfort. This is such a liberating insight, we’ll speak more about it in the next part of this book.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But first we must highlight one last area where more selfishness is good–sex. Oh, yes. About time we got a little spice up in here. While I can’t promise you a graphic romance novel-style sex scene, I can show you how healthy self-interest will actually lead to more sex and better sex for the rest of your life. Ready? I’m sure you are.</p>
