<h4 class="Header-02">How Nice <a id="_idTextAnchor021"></a>
 Creates Pain</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Remember Jim’s anger in the last section? Well it turns out that part of Jim really doesn’t want him to become aware of that anger. The same is true for us. We all have what are called “defense mechanisms.” These are ways that our mind attempts to minimize our emotional pain and discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, one classic defense mechanism is denial. If something painful is happening, you simply declare it is not happening. If things are going downhill fast in his marriage, a man might tell his friends, and truly believe, “My wife loves me. She thinks I’m the greatest guy in the world.” If someone smokes cigarettes, they are generally in a state of denial about what impact this is having on their body and what the consequences will be down the line.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These defenses exist to minimize the experience of uncomfortable or painful feelings, such as anger, hurt, fear, terror, sadness, and grief. They often operate below our conscious awareness. Hence, we rarely think: <span class="CharOverride-9">Hmm, I’m starting to feel some terror about knowing life is impermanent and I’m going to die. I’m also feeling deep grief about my brother being ill. Now, to defend myself against these feelings, I’m going to maximize my stress about work and focus on my upcoming project as if it’s life or death.</span>
 Instead, we just feel stressed about this damn project at work, check our email forty-seven times per day, and worry about what will happen if we don’t pull it off perfectly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When we were trained to be nice growing up, we learned that certain feelings are acceptable, such as happiness, gladness, gratitude and excitement. Other feelings, like sadness and fear are less acceptable and should be kept to a minimum. Other feelings, like anger and aggression are in their own category and never OK. Especially anger at family, loved ones, people who’ve done things for us, and so on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When an unacceptable feeling starts to form in our mind and body, our defenses kick in to keep it out of awareness. It’s tagged as “not OK,” and labeled as a threat. This can make us feel anxious simply about acknowledging and feeling an emotion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Anger and rage at our boss, spouses, kids, neighbors, friends, or anyone else can be seen as highly threatening to our identity and sense of self. <span class="CharOverride-9">I am a good person. A loving person. A nice person. I don’t feel those terrible things.</span>
 But what if these feelings start to build up to the point where we may notice them? Enter the ultimate defense: physical pain.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is the perfect defense because it’s absorbing and distracting. Have you ever woken up with a neck so painfully sore that you could barely turn your head? How much do you think about that during the day? Heck, how much do you think about that per minute?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Ow, yep. It’s still hurting when I turn it that way. Man, this is bad. Is my pillow too soft? Was it from sitting too long at the computer yesterday? Then I went to the gym and did those pull-ups. It was all those pull-ups. I’m doing those wrong. I wonder what I’ll do tomorrow for my workout. I may have to cut those out. Why does this keep happening to me? This is so annoying. I bet I have a rib out. I should set up an appointment with my chiropractor…</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The pain is completely absorbing and provides the ultimate distraction from our underlying threatening feelings. Now we’re stressed, afraid, and self-pitying. These feelings are miles away from the threatening rage or sadness underneath.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even better, the problem is viewed as entirely physical and structural. It’s because you slept wrong, lifted something wrong, moved wrong. You sat too long, sat too slumped, or your wrist was not at the right angle to your desk. You need physical and structural solutions, like a different chair, a chiropractic manipulation, or maybe even surgery. One hundred percent structural and one hundred percent safe from those terrifying emotions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The pain is created by your subconscious mind, and it can show up in a variety of ways. How it manifests depends on your personal history, and what is most likely to grip your attention and keep it stuck on the physical. Here is a just a short list of some of the pains that can be caused by repressed emotion: stomach problems, acid reflux, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn’s disease, eczema, skin rashes, allergies, temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ), repetitive strain injuries (RSI), tendonitis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, neck pain, upper or lower back pain, buttock pain, pain running down the legs, knee pain, ankle pain, foot pain (including bone spurs and plantar fasciitis).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This list is by no means comprehensive. I believe there are more conditions that are psychogenic in nature, that is, their source is repressed emotion. At this point, any new pain or discomfort I feel, the first question I ask myself is, “what could be upsetting me in my life right now? What feelings might I not want to feel?” Then I start feeling emotions directly, and magically and consistently the pain subsides.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Using this approach, I have eliminated TMJ and other jaw pain, wrist pain, upper back and neck pain, shoulder pain, plantar fasciitis, irritable bowel and other stomach pain, and much more. I am able to run, do heavy squats and deadlifts, and fully use my body to its capacity, which is something that delights me to this day. I feel a tremendous amount of gratitude for the teachers who have illuminated these sneaky patterns, and helped me create a new level of freedom in my body.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Your Choice</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I realize that what I’m sharing here is way outside the box. If you went to a chiropractor, physical therapist, surgeon, or many other doctors, they would emphatically tell you that your pain is due to structural abnormalities in your spine, or the way your foot lands when you walk, or a thousand other structural theories.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you read this alternative viewpoint, you may have a variety of reactions. Part of you might be intrigued and maybe even inspired or hopeful. Another part of you might be skeptical or think, <span class="CharOverride-9">if this were true, then everyone would know it and be doing it.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You have a choice. You can continue reading this section and the rest of the book and benefit tremendously in your self-esteem, personal power, confidence, social life, business life, and overall success and happiness. You can ignore this wacky information about all this pain coming from our emotions. And that’s OK.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On the other hand, you can choose to go deeper into a study of this, and become completely free on a physical level. Free of chronic or recurrent pain and injuries, free of limitation of how you can use your body, and free to do the activities you truly love, like running, biking, basketball, soccer, or anything else. If you’ve ever been injured or dealt with chronic pain, you know how limiting, depressing, and scary it can be. For me, to be free of that, and to know I’m no longer a helpless victim in the area of my body and health is one of the greatest liberations of my life. Even more so than breaking out of social anxiety.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Therefore, if you’d like to go deeper and overcome all this pain, here’s how to do it:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. Get John E. Sarno’s books: <span class="CharOverride-9">The Mindbody Prescription</span>
 and <span class="CharOverride-9">Healing Back Pain</span>
 and read them. They are also available in audio version so you can listen to them instead.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. Get Steve Ozanich’s book: <span class="CharOverride-9">The Great Pain Deception</span>
 and read that one as well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">3. Go to the TMS Wiki. It is an amazing resource with endless stories of how people healed and eliminated a wide range of physical problems using the methods from Dr. Sarno’s books: <span class="CharOverride-15">http://www.tmswiki.org/</span>
</p>
