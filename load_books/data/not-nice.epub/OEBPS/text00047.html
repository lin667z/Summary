<h4 class="Header-02">How It Works</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Here is the three-step process for eliminating excessive niceness and becoming a much more authentic, confident version of you:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. Decide to be not nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. Do the not nice stuff that makes you scared and uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">3. Work through the internal backlash (guilt, anxiety, doubt, fear) afterwards.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then do it all again. If you continue in this process, and do not stop, over time you gain more power and stop being so anxious about other people’s opinions of you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Most people never make it that far because they get stuck in Step 1. They never decide to “not be nice” because they equate that with being a bad human. You, on the other hand, may have already decided to be less nice and more bold after reading Part I of this book. Or, you may not quite be there yet, and you may decide to be more authentic and direct after reading Part II and gaining more clarity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even if someone decides they don’t want to be nice, Step 2 often trips people up. How many times have you decided you are going to be more assertive and direct, or speak your honest opinion in a situation, or confidently approach people at a party, only to get there and stay small, quiet, and on the sidelines? Right in the moment of action our boldness and resolve leaves us, and we quickly revert to our nice and safe behaviors. Then, afterwards, we might beat ourselves up about it, which in no way moves us forward. It’s just an unhelpful pattern that operates outside of our conscious control.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But let’s say you’re on a mission. You are not going to be stopped. You decide you’re not going to be nice. You face your fear and speak up, or say no, or put yourself first for once. Success! Right? Sure, but it doesn’t feel that way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I saw in myself, and in clients who are breaking free from niceness, is an intense discomfort after being less nice in a situation. This can arise as guilt for what we said or did: <span class="CharOverride-9">Oh my God! They must be crushed after I said I didn’t like their favorite movie!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It can show up as fear, anxiety, or worry: <span class="CharOverride-9">What did they think of me for speaking up like that? Hector did not look happy. He thinks I’m an idiot who doesn’t know what he’s talking about. Why did I do that?</span>
 And it can lead to endless rumination and replaying of scenes again and again in your mind, like a bad song that you can’t get out of your head.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This backlash trips most people up because they misinterpret it. They think it is the voice of their conscience, the voice of reason, the voice of their inner guidance. This creates confusion, doubt, uncertainty, and hesitation in future situations. <span class="CharOverride-9">Is it really good to speak my mind like that? Is it really OK to ask for what I want? I mean look at how much I’m hurting her when I tell her what’s bothering me. Look at how crushed he is after I told him I didn’t want to date him any more.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This doubt creates just enough confusion to stall the process. You’re no longer certain that it’s OK to not be nice. Your nice person programming sneakily regains control and you fall back into the cage, more unsure of yourself than ever.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But if you can stick with it, and work through the discomfort of the backlash, this is the way out. This is your path to power, peace, confidence, and freedom. This is your path to reclaim yourself–the real you–who has been lost under layers of niceness, fear, and messages about who you “should” be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This book will provide you the tools and guidance you need to stick with this process. This book will help you alleviate the doubt and questioning about whether it’s OK or not to be more direct, assertive, clear, and powerful. It will be an orienting force that you can use to steer yourself in the direction you are meant to go in life. It will help set you free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the chapters that follow in Part II, you will discover and master the five pillars of not-nice: having boundaries, owning your shadow, speaking up, being more selfish, and saying “no”.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But before we dive in, you need to upgrade your operating system. You need to consciously create your own guiding force that helps direct you in life. You need a personal bill of rights.</p>
