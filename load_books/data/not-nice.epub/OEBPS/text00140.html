 lity Discomfort</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you build your capacity to tolerate discomfort, more and more possibilities will open up in your life. In fact, the pathway out of Extra Niceville and into being your most powerful, authentic self <span class="CharOverride-9">requires</span>
 discomfort tolerance. Here are just a few of the things we’ve discussed in this book along that pathway:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Saying no</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Asking directly for what you want</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Being assertive</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Having disagreement or conflict with another (and approaching it directly)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Speaking up for yourself</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Taking care of yourself</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Acting in your healthy self-interest (instead of self-sacrificing)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’ve been nice for years, virtually every single one of these will be uncomfortable when you first start doing them. Hell, some of them are uncomfortable for me even after doing them for years. But I do them anyway because I know they will greatly enhance my life and help me do what I’m here to do. The discomfort is not totally gone, I’m just more powerful in the face of it. And the same will be true for you.</p>
