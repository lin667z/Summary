<h4 class="Header-02">Unlovable</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I had friends, colleagues, and women I’d dated who all liked me. They had great experiences with me, and many of them might even say they loved me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But I didn’t feel loved.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Because I had remained hidden in all of those relationships. I’d kept parts of myself out of sight, avoided certain topics, and molded myself to be the person that I thought they wanted. I hid my anger, dislike, frustration, sadness, despair, and anxiety. I hid anything that I deemed “negative” or undesirable. I hid anything that I thought was unlovable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And so, I never felt fully loved. I never felt safe in any relationship. Underneath, there was always the fear: <span class="CharOverride-9">if they saw the real me, how I really am, they’d be turned off, repelled, or disgusted. They would leave, reject me, not want to work with me, or not want to date me. They would be outta here.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Hence a chronic feeling of anxiety, waiting in the background. It might disappear while I was in the moment, enjoying a conversation with a friend, only to return on my drive home. I’d replay everything I said, scanning it to make sure it was just right. I’d replay moments where I might have offended them or said something they didn’t like. I’d ruminate on the interaction, scanning for things I did that would make them dislike me, and I’d feel scared.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This was the elaborate cage I’d created for myself. This was the prison of niceness that kept me contained, hidden, and separate from others. This was the source of endless hours of fear, self-doubt, and torment. And this is exactly what I needed to break free from in order to reach a new level of confidence, freedom, and joy in my life.</p>
