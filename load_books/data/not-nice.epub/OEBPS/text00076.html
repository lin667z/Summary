<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Owning your shadow will profoundly serve you in several ways. First, as I described just moments ago, it can help you feel lighter, happier, and more energized. It can dramatically reduce and eliminate a wide variety of chronic forms of physical pain. It provides you with a surge of vitality, passion, purpose, and creativity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Owning your shadow can also dramatically reduce the amount of guilt you feel on a daily basis. Most nice people I know are carrying heavy backpacks of guilt on their shoulders that they add to frequently. They are constantly feeling bad about themselves, responsible for others, and losing the battle against the inner voice that tells them they’re a bad person. Much of this guilt comes from being identified with the Superego and thinking that anything that comes from your Id is bad. <span class="CharOverride-10">Guilt is the Superego’s primary weapon against the Id.</span>
 When you release the battle with your shadow, you will release your guilt, and your sense of happiness and joy will magnify dramatically.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Finally, as you own your shadow more, you will become more powerful because this shadow is a major part of your life force energy. It’s your primal desire. It’s one of your major sources of fuel. Anger, aggression, and sexual energy. These are the deepest and most ingrained motivators in all species on earth. When we disconnect from our shadow, we disconnect from this source of energy and we lose our power.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We can’t stand up for ourselves, aren’t seen as sexually desirable by potential partners, and are generally overlooked in life. Others speak over us, dominate us, mock us, and make us feel small. They demand more, take it ungratefully, and then demand even more. And we keep doing it. We keep giving, we keep pleasing, we keep smiling because we’ve cut ourselves off from our own shadow, from our own power, from the very thing that can save us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s why you must own your shadow. You can think of those raw energies of desire, anger, aggression, and sexual impulse as the raw materials you might use to run a power plant. Your shadow is like the coal, the raging river, the natural gas, the nuclear reaction, or the bright heat of the sun. All of those forces are immense and can instantly destroy you if you let them take over. But when you harness them, you can use them to generate targeted, effective forms of power.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is essential to understand as we move towards one of the core pillars of Anti-Niceness and topics of this book: how to speak up for yourself. Doing so requires energy; it requires power. And that power is going to come directly from your shadow.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, if you don’t speak up in meetings, are ignored by senior management, and colleagues talk over you when you try to share your ideas, then you need to speak up for yourself. You need power to do so. And that power is going to start deep in your core as anger and aggression. It’s going to be your Id saying: <span class="CharOverride-9">What the f**k? How dare you talk to me that way? How dare you talk over me? Shut the f**k up, Gary! I’ll kill you!</span>
 Of course, you don’t actually kill Gary. Instead, this energy passes through a network of tubes and hoses inside of your body and mind and comes out as assertiveness: “Hold on a second, Gary, I’m not done. Let me finish my point.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Your tone as you say this is calm, yet firm and commanding. There is a power behind it that gives you an authority makes people pause and listen to you, and much more likely to heed your request. If speaking up is something you struggle to do–if you often desire or intend to but fear prevents you from doing so–you may be disconnected from your full power from years. If on occasion you do speak up for yourself, and you are overlooked, ignored, or bowled over after doing so, it may be time to harness the power of your shadow.</p>
