<h4 class="Header-02">Share What Interests You...</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">...Not what others ask you. We have all been trained to respond to the questions people ask us. If someone asks us a question, we’ll usually instantly answer it without thinking twice. Or, if for some reason we don’t want to, we still feel a strong pressure to do so. And the nicer we were taught to be, the stronger that pressure is.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But speaking up is not about doing what everyone else might want or expect. It’s about doing more of what you want. One key way to do this is through what you share in conversations with others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Most people don’t realize the wide-open frontier that conversations are. Instead, they’re usually just a predetermined series of standard questions that you have predetermined answers for.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do you do? Where do you live? Where’s your name from? (well, maybe only some of us get that one). And to each of those standard questions we have a default response. Think about that for a moment. Do you have standard phrases in response to common questions? Do you say virtually the same thing every time? And, if so, how engaging is that? How fun is that for you? Of course, your mind says: <span class="CharOverride-9">Well, I have to answer their questions...</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you? I’ll never forget the breakthrough insight I had while working at the Homeless Veterans Rehabilitation Program in California during my clinical psychology training. There was one crusty old psychologist who’d been at that treatment center for four decades and was gruff, direct, and had a huge heart. His name was Don, and I really admired him.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I remember after one group therapy session with some of the veterans he pulled me aside. I was new at the center, relatively new in my training, way too nice, and generally a softie. These guys in the treatment center had been in the army, addicted to drugs, and lived on the streets. Many had spent time in and out of prison. I was no match for them. During this group, one of the guys started asking me questions–where I grew up, what my training was like, my experience with substances. As the questions continued, I started to get more uncomfortable, yet continued to answer them, because what else could I do? Not answer them? Gasp!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After the meeting, Don pulled me aside and said to me, “Aziz, when someone asks you a question, you don’t have to answer it.” In that moment, a lightning bolt hit a light bulb in my head.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Really?” I asked. “How do you do that? What do you say?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well, it depends on the situation, but anything I want really,” he replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Like what?” I needed specifics. I needed the exact words. I needed the “pick-up line,” the script that’d keep me safe.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I don’t want to answer that question,” he offered.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Whoa. That blew my mind. So simple. So obvious. Yet so outside of my world at the time. And the way he said it mattered. It had no edge to it. No defensiveness, no push-back, no guilt. It was very matter of fact, relaxed, and friendly. As if someone said, “Do you want fries with that?” and you said, “no.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Flash forward a decade and I now teach people many different ways to do the exact same thing Don taught me that day. Here are some specific examples so you can see how to use this in your life now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One time I was in line at a restaurant where you order at the counter. I struck up a conversation with the woman in front of me by asking her what she was going to order. We ended up talking together while we waited for our burritos to be prepared. Soon into the conversation she asked me, “So what do you do?” Standard question, standard answer, right? No, let’s try something different.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So instead I replied, “Ahh, the old ‘what do you do question…’” I said this in a playful tone, like a kung fu master might respond to a student who asks him how to do the Flying Dragon Kick of Death. (As you can see my entire knowledge of kung fu is based on the <span class="CharOverride-9">Kung Fu Panda</span>
 movies.)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I paused for just a second, and she had a slightly unsure, slightly confused look on her face. “I can answer that one, but let’s mix it up first. Something different. Something fun. How about I ask you two random questions, and then you ask me two random questions?” I gave her another playful look, like a street vendor who is holding out a plush handbag, saying “Who are you to resist it, ehh?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Sure,” she said as she cracked a smile.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s just one way you can ask or share what interests you more in conversations. Once you’ve given yourself full permission to do this, there are an unlimited number of ways to steer a conversation towards something that engages you more. Yes, engages <span class="CharOverride-9">you</span>
 . The purpose of a conversation is to connect, have fun, build trust, and possibly form some kind of relationship. And if you’re not having fun, and only pretending to be engaged, then no real relationship will form. And if you can’t steer it, or the person gets freaked out and wants to follow the standard conversation protocol, then how fun is your connection going to be in the long run? How much are you really going to enjoy talking with them as the months and years go by?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Another way to share what interests you is to simply do so spontaneously, without even being asked a question about it. If you just saw an amazing movie, or had an intense thing happen, and you were meeting up with a friend, what would you do? Would you immediately jump in and say, “Dude! You are not going to believe what just happened!” Most likely. Although you might not start all your conversations with the word “dude” like I do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Dude, the key point to remember here is you can do this with people other than your best friend. You can share freely and spontaneously with someone you just met, a work colleague, or when you meet your friend’s girlfriend.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If a colleague at work asks you, “Hey, how’s it going?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead of, “Good. And you?” You can say something like, “I’m doing good. I just got back from the mountain yesterday. There is so much snow up there. It’s crazy!” Or, if you didn’t have any big adventures the day before, you can simply share something from your life. “I’m doing fine. I talked with my brother last night. He met a guy at a party who was really into the topic of cattle mutilation. Have you ever heard of that? It’s crazy.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yes, that’s a real thing. You can look it up on <span class="CharOverride-9">Wikipedia</span>
 . It’s a strange mystery and no one knows exactly what’s happening, but some people think it’s aliens. I’m using that as an example because I did just speak with my brother yesterday and that is what he told me about.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And if that’s too wack-a-balls crazy sounding for you, you can share about a book you’re reading, or a show you saw, or a hobby you’re into. Something. Anything. The key here is to spontaneously put more of yourself out there so others know you better, and you feel freer to express yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even if someone asks you a question, you can minimally answer it and then share about what you find more interesting.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So, what do you do?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m a coach and an author. And one thing I’m super into these days is something called heart intelligence, have you heard of it?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, instead of answering standard questions about who I coach and what I write about, I can share about something that I’m actively interested in right now.

 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How can you start doing this in your life more? Are you aware of what you’re most interested in? Just as a little drill, I mean game, let’s try this. On the count of three, come up with the first five things that pop into your head that you’re interested in, or did recently, or learned, or watched, or heard. It could be anything. Don’t filter any of them out as boring, or too strange, or insignificant. This is just a game to practice building your spontaneous sharing muscle. Ready, 1...2...3. Go!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What came to your mind? Your dog, a movie you watched yesterday, working out? Don’t dismiss anything like this as irrelevant or uninteresting. <span class="CharOverride-10">Anything about your life that is interesting to you, is interesting.</span>
 It matters. If we see it this way, and share it this way, it tends to have a different impact on others as well. If you let your natural enthusiasm, passion, or interest for something show, other people tend to be way more engaged and responsive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, if someone asks you what you did yesterday after work, and you say in a flat, dismissive tone, “nothing much, just went to the gym then home,” then not much will come of that. They’ll get the message that you don’t want to talk about it and the conversation will stall out, or you’ll have to scramble to find something else to talk about. Or you can just direct all the attention to them (which is usually the nice-person’s comfort zone anyway).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, what if you knew that your life was fascinating and interesting? What if you stopped dismissing and criticizing yourself and your life as boring and lame? Are you engaged in it? Are you excited about the things you’re doing? If the answer to that is no, then it might be a sign to start doing some things you’re interested in. If your life is dull, repetitive, and you feel bored, it means you have too much certainty and you spend too much time in your comfort zone. You need to step up, try new things, explore, grow, challenge yourself and get scared. That will bring back energy, passion, and vitality fast.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I often find is that people are actually interested in their lives. They do like the things they do. But they’re telling themselves others won’t find them interesting. For this, I suggest you take a page out of the book of Zaim, my three-year-old son. Or your inner three-year-old. When I get home from work, he’ll scream, “Daddy!” and run over to give me a hug (which is the best feeling in the world). Then he’ll launch into a completely random story from his day, usually right in the middle of it so the context is not entirely clear. “We went to Mountain Land! Teddy and T-Rex came across, but Triceratops didn’t. I found my little guys!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Your little guys?” I ask with a big smile on my face.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yeah! My little earplug guys. They were swimming and swimming, and over here, and over there, and one said, ‘aggghh!’” He pauses for a moment, looking a little sad, then continues. “Those guys didn’t go to Mountain Land…”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Aww, they didn’t?” I ask.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No, ‘cause they were with me in the bath!” he says, enthusiasm fully returned.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This can go on for a good long while… in three year-old-time, which is two minutes. Then it’s time to sit down and play doctor, stat!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I love about these exchanges is his complete lack of hesitancy about my interest in the topic. He just assumes that of course I’d be interested in this because it happened to him. He doesn’t even have the evaluation of whether something is interesting or not. It’s something that occurred and he loves me and wants to share it with me. He wants to be seen, to be known. To connect these interests with others. We all do, no matter what our age.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, when you share about what you did the night before, what if you brought back some of your three-year-old self? What might you say?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“After work, I went straight to the gym. I have all my gym clothes ready to go in my trunk so I don’t have any excuses. I had a great workout! I’ve been going consistently for about four months. And my goal is to go four times per week this entire year. So far it feels awesome.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How does that feel? Completely different than the first response, right? And it’s so much truer. It’s your actual experience instead of some downplayed, muted, stuffed down, I’m-not-interesting-so-let’s-not-talk-about-me act. And guess what kind of response that’s going to get from someone? Do you think they’ll be less engaged than with the first response, or more engaged? That’s right, much more. Usually.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If for some reason, you share this and it gets no traction and the other person gives a minimal response and changes the subject, what does that mean? That you’re boring and what you shared is stupid? No! Watch out for those old stories. It means that person is not interested in working out. Or, more likely, that person has some issue in their life about their health, and uncomfortable feelings got stirred up in them when they heard about your commitment and enthusiasm. Perhaps they felt inferior, or guilty, and are telling themselves they should go to the gym more. Who knows? The point is you can express yourself. You can share who you are. Because you matter. And what you think, feel, and experience matters.</p>
