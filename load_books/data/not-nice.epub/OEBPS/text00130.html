<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">
<span class="CharOverride-10">In my reality, I don’t do things I don’t want to do.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s a statement I remind myself of often. It’s another way of bringing me back to hell yes, hell no, and my power of choice. In some places it’s harder than others. And in some areas of life, I have to dig deeper to see that I really do want to do what I’m doing. For example, changing a poopy diaper is generally not on my preferred list of activities. So, in a sense, I don’t want to change the diaper. However, I do want children, I want to take care of them, I want them to feel nurtured, loved, and safe. I want to help Candace and create a home that is filled with love and harmony. So, it looks like I want to change that poopy diaper after all. Now, if you’ll excuse me for just one moment…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One place that I’m very clear about what I want and don’t want is in my social time. With two small children, a wife who I can’t get enough of, and a mission that I’m passionate about, my time for hanging out socially is precious. I want to spend that time with friends and family that inspire me, and fill me with love, connection, laughter, and joy. So, I say no to a lot of offers. (That’s right, I’m big time).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A little while back, a friend from my old men’s group reached out to me. I say friend, although our time together had only been in the context of the men’s group. I loved being with him in that setting and his humor would make me laugh all the time. I really appreciated him and we grew a lot together over the two years I was in the group. After I left the group, we had lunch a few times, and no contact in between. Here’s a recent text conversation we had:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Eric</span>
 :</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">AZIZ! Eric here. How are you my man?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I need you dude.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I have in earnest begun to face my fear of monogamy. I have my someone who’s quite incredible and it’s triggering stuff.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You have a relationship that I admire, so I am talking to those who have those relationships to get their experiences.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, lunch soon? Plus, I’d love to catch up see how you are!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Me</span>
 :</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Hey Eric! Congrats on finding a super special lady. You are quite incredible, so it’s a good match :)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am currently over-extended between work, family, and other commitments. I have decided to take care of myself by slowing down and not saying yes to much for 2-3 months. So, unfortunately, I won’t be available for lunch for another few months or so.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Eric</span>
 :</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Honestly Aziz, that feels very off-puting actually. I never hear from you, and when I reach out you’re 3 months out? I know it’s not personal, but really?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you honestly expect me to stay engaged with you with a response like that?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Strikes me as pretty arrogant, though I know it’s really not your intention.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Me</span>
 :</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Eric - I’m sorry my man. It sounds like you have a desire or expectation for a certain level of connection/friendship with me. I love you and deeply appreciate the growth we did together in the Men’s Group—and I will have lessons and memories of that for the rest of my life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And I am currently not seeking the same level of relationship at this time. Having 2 small children is a pretty crazy, full-on experience. There are people in my inner circle that I have not seen in months. I wish you all the best in your new relationship, and in all areas of your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Haha, look at us, a couple of no-longer-nice-guys. I’m saying “no” and you’re upset and telling me about it : )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Eric</span>
 :</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Well, I don’t have a new relationship. It’s a potential one. It’s, of course, complicated, and as of yesterday, not going well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As far as your response and where you’re at, I don’t really know what to make of it. I appreciate you have kids and that’s a huge working operation. But as far as expectation? Seeing you once every 15 months does not sound too terribly unreasonable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel rejected and unappreciated. And I know if I don’t reach out in the future, that’ll be it for us. That does not feel good to me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And Aziz, I’m not talking about us hanging out, or me becoming Uncle Eric. It’s just lunch.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Me</span>
 :</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m sorry Eric. I am just not available in the way you’d like me to be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How do you feel as you read this? Uncomfortable? Upset? Are you judging him or me? Pay attention, because it will reveal your own stance on saying no.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s take a moment to break this down, because it can help liberate you to have full permission to follow your own inner guidance. He clearly wants to spend time with me, and is making a direct request for it. In your rulebook, is it OK to say “no” to that? Is it sometimes OK? Never OK?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Does your preference matter in this situation? If you want to spend time together, it’s a no-brainer. But what if you <span class="CharOverride-9">don’t</span>
 ? What if you feel a sense of resistance or aversion in your heart to the idea? Does your mind come in and try to convince you? Does it start to tell you that you’re wrong for saying no, that this person “needs you,” or that you’re someone selfish or bad?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Most of us learned in our early days of nice-programing that our preferences are secondary. That it is our duty to meet other people’s requests, regardless of how we feel about it. And if we don’t feel like it, our feelings are wrong and must be overridden.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I used to operate from this rule book too. And it led to a great deal of anxiety, pain, and frustration. In fact, being too nice is what led me into the men’s group where I met Eric in the first place!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Several years ago I would have been unable to have this kind of exchange with Eric. I most likely would have simply agreed to see him to avoid the discomfort. The fear and guilt I’d experience around saying no would have been so intense that it wouldn’t have felt worth it to me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But, I’ve been flexing my NO muscle all these years. I’ve had hundreds of opportunities to practice as my business has grown and I’ve begun to interact with thousands of people through the internet. To say yes to everything that everyone asks me for and wants me to do would be impossible. And so, I’ve learned how to say no.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I found most surprising about this exchange was how little guilt I felt. It was clear to myself that I wasn’t available in the way he wanted me to be, and I didn’t feel a sense of guilt or obligation as if I “should” be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">The more you say no, the easier it gets.</span>
 You become more clear, direct, and relaxed with doing what you want to do, and not doing what you don’t want to do. This creates a much greater sense of choice in your life, which generates feelings of freedom, happiness, and enjoyment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s turn now to the specifics of exactly how to do it. Below you’ll discover how to say no in a way that is clear, respectful, and loving, while still maintaining your boundaries.</p>
