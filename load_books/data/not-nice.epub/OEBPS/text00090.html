<h4 class="Header-02">Turn Down Your Filters</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Many people that come to my <span class="CharOverride-9">Confident Conversation Master</span>
 live event have a story that says, “I don’t know what to say,” or “I don’t have anything good to say.” This story shows up and interferes with their ability to start conversations with strangers, approach people they find attractive, or interact with others in a business and networking setting. What they discover by the end of the first day of the event, however, is that they have an endless amount of things to say. The issue isn’t good content, it’s that they have their filters on too high.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Humans are social animals, and we love to talk. Even if you think of yourself as a hardcore introvert who could do without most human interaction, you still like to talk. How do I know this? Because if you were in solitary confinement for a week, completely isolated in a room by yourself, and then someone came to visit you after that week, what would you do? Start talking. Talking would be like a tall glass of water after a long day in the hot desert sun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The real issue is that we filter out all the things we want to share. We also filter out all the questions we really want to ask. We make sure both of these are polite, normal, and nothing out of the ordinary or unusual. So, we end up with an extremely narrow band of what we can ask, and an even smaller range of options for what we can share. And then we run those potentials through <span class="CharOverride-9">another</span>
 filter: the “will they find this interesting?” or “is this good enough?” or “this better not offend or upset anyone” filter. Sometimes we’re running our communication through all three of these filters and more. And guess what? Nothing much more than a trickle comes out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A huge component of speaking up socially and being freer is to radically turn down your filters. Not all the way, but a significant amount. This topic is so important, that I have an entire chapter devoted to it later in this book. It’s Chapter 14: 100% You, and it’s in the “Life On Your Terms” section. Be sure to read that to help you filter less and speak freely more.</p>
