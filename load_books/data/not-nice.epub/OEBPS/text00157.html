<h4 class="Header-02">Lack of Inner Authority</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If you’re experiencing a lack of inner authority in any area of your life, then you know what it feels like. It involves uncertainty about how to respond to a specific situation, what to say, or how to behave. You may even be unsure of how you “should” think and feel. You might be imagining different people in your life, or different books you’ve read, considering what each of them might say to you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You also have the sense that there is a “right” way to handle the situation that someone else knows. But you don’t know the right way and whatever was your way wasn’t quite as good as it should be. Sometimes this feeling is very strong and obvious and you’re filled with uncertainty, anxiety, seconding guessing, and self-doubt. Sometimes it’s subtler; it’s just a feeling of not being certain, fully strong in yourself, or slightly timid.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You might then look to others too much, hoping they have the answers you need. And, for better or worse, you can definitely find people who have all the certainty in the world. Whether it’s a book, your brother, or your colleague at work, there are many places you can find someone speaking with complete certainty and authority. Because they sound so sure of themselves, and you secretly feel unsure inside, it can be natural to conclude that they have it all figured out and you don’t. So, it would be best to simply follow their advice. Do what they say.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But certainty does not correlate with accuracy. In other words, someone could be certain about something and completely wrong. Their advice could be terrible. But their certainty is so dang convincing, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Only when we’re not giving ourselves permission to be the authority in our own lives. Because deep down, you are just as certain. <span class="CharOverride-10">There is a part of you in your core, in your heart, that always knows the next best move for you.</span>
 It knows how to respond, what to say, and what to do. There’s just so much mental noise and old programming telling you not to trust yourself. That noise tells you: <span class="CharOverride-9">Trust in your teacher, your parents, those people with more experience, those people who can talk a better game and sound more confident. Don’t trust in yourself. Who are you to know anything?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unfortunately, many of us received this message growing up so much that we bought into it and now believe it to be true. But it’s not. You are the authority in your life. You know what’s best for you. Your heart, when you slow down, tune into it, breath and listen, can guide you forward. You can be you. It’s OK. It’s safe. The world will not end, friends will not disappear, and you will not end up alone and miserable for the rest of your life. Quite the opposite actually!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Your energy will return and magnify tenfold. Lightness, joy, and your natural sense of humor will come out more and more. Decisions will be easier and doubt will dissolve as you just choose and take action. Once you stop thinking there’s someone who can tell you what to do who knows more than you, all your power returns. Then you are a force of nature. Look out.</p>
