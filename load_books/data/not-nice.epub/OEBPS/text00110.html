 riority List</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In order to move up the spectrum towards more healthy self-interest, you will need to shift your priorities. To illustrate this, let’s start with a little story about a client named Ellie. Pay attention to what elements of her story may be similar to your own.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ellie was a highly motivated, successful sales woman who was well respected in her company. She was married to a loving husband, and they had two young children under the age of five. On paper, Ellie’s life was perfect. She had love, career success, respect, and material wealth. Yet she didn’t feel relaxed, free, or happy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">She spent much of her time feeling anxious, stressed, and guilty. Even though she worked a full-time job, she expected herself to run the household, including shopping, laundry, cooking and cleaning, as well as taking care of the kids. In her opinion, the house was never as it “should be” and she was falling short. At work, she often felt anxious before meetings with superiors, high profile clients, and other executives, despite having been in the field for twenty years. When she spent time with her parents, whom she described as loving, she felt anxious and couldn’t bear the idea of them being disappointed with her.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we explored her world more closely, an interesting trend began to emerge. Regarding maintaining the household, she didn’t ask her husband for more help because she worried about putting more on his plate. She worried about whether she was being a good enough mother to her children, and if they were getting everything they wanted and needed. At work she worried about whether the high profile clients were satisfied, and if her superiors felt comfortable in her presence at meetings and social events.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At first the pattern was subtle to her, almost invisible. But then she began to see just how pervasive the pattern was: <span class="CharOverride-10">in virtually every situation in her life, she was prioritizing others’ needs, wants, and feelings over her own.</span>
 Her attention and energy was always focused outwards—<span class="CharOverride-9">What do they want here? What does he need? How does she feel about that? Will they be OK here?</span>
 –and on and on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This was based on the unquestioned belief that it was always right to prioritize other people’s needs. After all, that is what a good, selfless, altruistic human does, right? This is the conditioning that most of us received. It can be compounded in families where ethics and morals are based in a strong religious foundation, depending on how that family interprets their faith. In these instances, the dictate to be selfless is not only good, but to do otherwise is a sin and reviled by family, community, and God alike. As a little kid, that’s some serious stuff that you don’t want to mess around with.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Jesus, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Saint Francis of Assisi, and countless other spiritual and political figures are heralded as models of goodness, virtue, and what a human should be. Meanwhile, overtly greedy and clearly self-interested politicians, corporate leaders, bankers, and other people who gain infamy from bending or breaking rules to enrich their own bank accounts, are universally seen as bad and how a human should <span class="CharOverride-9">not</span>
 be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And so, you may strive to be like those from the first list, and avoid all actions that push you towards the second. You let the other person go first, give when it’s hard, act patiently with demanding people, support others through their hardships, and turn the other cheek. You act as a good person should. You appear loving, generous, altruistic, kind, and good to others. But what happens inside?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It may start small at first, like a few grains of sand that slip into your shoe as you walk on the beach. Barely perceptible. It’s a hint of disappointment when your partner seems to take the meal you prepared for granted. It’s the minor irritation you feel with your children as they take forever to get ready in the morning. It’s the slight sense of emptiness and dissatisfaction you feel as you fall asleep at the end of a long work day.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Over time, these grains of sand begin to grow into pebbles that stab at your feet with each step. This manifests as anxiety, difficulty sleeping, and feeling depressed. <span class="CharOverride-9">I don’t know why I’m depressed, I should be happy. Maybe it runs in my family. It must be genetic. There’s something wrong with my brain chemicals.</span>
 Your knee begins acting up again from that old injury from fifteen years ago and you start having more problems with your back. Even though you’re loving with your family, friends, and coworkers, when you’re driving alone and someone cuts you off, the level of instant rage you feel is surprisingly powerful and a little disturbing. You sometimes feel guilty about how angry you secretly get.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This story can go on and the intensity of symptoms and discomfort can continue to build, all with absolutely no awareness of what is happening and why. Millions of people are struggling just like this, and they seek counsel from their primary care doctor who tells them they have clinical depression and prescribes them an antidepressant medication after a twelve-minute consult. The medication kind of, sort of works, maybe. But maybe they need to change to a different one, because “sometimes it just takes a while to find the right one.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">All the while, they’re missing the true source of their suffering. It’s a problem with their priorities. When our needs and wants are habitually and consistently placed as low or last priority, we’re going to suffer. It’s a recipe for resentment. In fact, it’s so predictable it’s virtually a mathematical formula.</p>
