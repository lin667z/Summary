<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">So, what are your rules?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You actually have hundreds or even thousands of rules in your head about all aspects of life. From what food you order at a restaurant, to how you respond to a solicitor, to what color your shoes should be based on your outfit. Don’t worry, we don’t need to uncover every single rule. That would be a long, exhausting, and unnecessary exercise (although perhaps interesting).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No, we’re interested in only one set of rules—the ones that tell you how you “should” be. How you should be around others, what you should say and do, and what you should never say and do. These are the rules about what is acceptable and appropriate. What will make others like you, or reject you. They’re also rules about how you should feel, and which feelings are OK to express and which ones are best kept hidden.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is the set of rules you unconsciously use to determine whether you are “good” or “bad.” Whether you are a worthy, lovable human being, or a guilty, bad, selfish, terrible, unlovable wretch.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sound extreme? It’s not an exaggeration. All of us have an inner critic that acts like a prosecutor and a judge. It’s constantly evaluating what we do, think, and feel. It’s inside our minds, so it’s aware of our innermost world, including the stuff we prefer no one else know about.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If we have unrealistic rules that are impossible to follow, like “I should never feel sad,” then we suffer. If we have faulty rules that tell us to do two conflicting things at the same time, like “be honest and speak your mind” and “never hurt others’ feelings or cause upset,” then we suffer. This suffering can take many forms.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For me, it created a perpetual sense of failing, falling short, and being inadequate. I felt anxious and afraid. I thought I was afraid of others and their judgments. Actually, I was afraid of my own inner critic, who would ruthlessly attack me if I broke even the smallest rule.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This created a deep and lasting sense of shame, as if there was something terribly wrong with me that I couldn’t fix. Needless to say, I didn’t have the best self-esteem as a result. And when our self-esteem is low, and we don’t think much of ourselves, life is awesome, right? No! Life is hard. We don’t reach out to people because we think we’re not good enough for them. We don’t offer our opinions because we think we’re not smart enough. We don’t hold relaxed eye contact for long because we fear others will see all the badness right beneath the surface.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This causes us to feel held back, stuck, and limited in many areas of life. It creates that frustrating and depressing feeling that we can’t get what we really want, and never will. You know the one I’m talking about, right? It sometimes leads to anger, sometimes to despair, but at the end of the day, it’s just pain. The pain of not living the life we want, of missing what matters most, and not truly enjoying this magical experience of being alive. Worst of all, we know on some level that what’s holding us back is ourselves, but trying to just push through and “fake it until you make it” doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s get cracking. Coming up with this list of rules will change your life. Because when you discover these rules, you are discovering the exact decisions that determine how you think, act, and feel. Uprooting the ones that are toxic and unhelpful can liberate you from decades of oppressive guilt. Changing one rule can transform relationships from confined obligation-fests into joyous experiences of sharing more love than you ever thought possible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These statements are not hype. Changing your rules is that powerful. The majority of this book is about helping you do just that. In Part II and III, we are going to obliterate the toxic rules that oppress you. You’re going to get a fresh, clear, and empowering perspective on how to relate to others, so you can be the most alive, unfettered, fearless, and free version of yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re excited about that, then stick with me here. Because if we don’t do the work in life, we never get the results we want. Moreover, this inner work is the most valuable thing you can do to transform your relationships, feelings, income, success and everything else. So, let’s get to work.</p>
