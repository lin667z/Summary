 ng the Shadow</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One of the biggest challenges most nice people face is the intense internal pressure to be a nice person. Our Superegos have completely taken over and our sense of self, our identity, is that we are a nice guy or a nice girl. To even consider that we might not really be as nice as we think, or to have a desire to be less nice is morally unacceptable and it’s offensive to even consider it. This is why many people become defensive and upset when you question the idea of being nice. It threatens the very core of their personality and how they’ve organized their entire lives.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yet regardless of how much we deny it, or how upset we get at someone for suggesting it, the reality remains that we have an Id inside of us that is not so nice. True freedom begins when we acknowledge this fact and stop making it wrong, stop fighting it, and stop fighting with ourselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">During my doctoral training at Stanford, I had an amazing opportunity to work closely with Dr. David Burns, author of <span class="CharOverride-9">Feeling Good</span>
 and one of the world’s leading cognitive-behavioral experts. I was involved in a small training group that would meet weekly with him to learn, practice, and master the skills of helping people change their beliefs and experience greater freedom and joy. One of the best parts about this training was that David insisted that the most effective way to learn was on real challenges that we were having, not abstract or made up role plays. I am deeply grateful for the insights and growth I experienced in those meetings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On one evening a colleague of mine, Jeff, was discussing a challenge he was having in his workplace. He was in the advanced stages of his training as a psychiatrist and was completing his residency. There was a fellowship position opening up in the very same department he was working, and he was excited about getting the highly sought after and coveted position. However, there were two other residents he was working with at the time who were just as eager to get the position. They had all worked together collaboratively for the last several years, supporting and encouraging each other. He considered them not just colleagues, but also friends. Now he was having feelings of comparison, judgment, and competition. He wanted that position and he didn’t want them to have it. And he felt guilty and ashamed about this.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As he should, right? What a competitive, selfish, greedy jerk! He should be wishing for the best for his colleagues, not secretly hoping they fail and he succeed, right? So says the Superego. Both his and mine, and maybe yours too. But I witnessed something powerful and life changing that evening. David didn’t use any techniques to help Jacob reduce his competitiveness, comparisons, or judgments of the other residents. He didn’t try to help Jeff be a “better” person at all. In fact, he did just the opposite. He fully owned and expressed the part of Jeff that was competitive, insecure, and looking to get ahead. He fully played the shadow and let it out into the room.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At one point, they did a role-play where David played an unabashed, completely honest version of Jeff—someone who wasn’t trying to hide or pretend he didn’t have a shadow. Jeff himself played one of his fellow residents who found out what Jeff was actually thinking and feeling.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Jeff</span>
 : Wow, you want that position so bad. I had no idea you were so selfish and competitive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">David</span>
 : Ha, yeah, it’s true. I really want that position.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Jeff</span>
 : Yeah, so do we. But we still care about each other. You obviously just care about yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">David</span>
 : I wouldn’t say I don’t care about you guys at all. Just in the case of this fellowship, I would prefer that I have it, instead of you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Jeff</span>
 : That’s so selfish of you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">David</span>
 : You don’t know the half of it! That’s just the tip of the iceberg of all the ways I can want things for myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Jeff</span>
 : That makes you a bad friend.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">David</span>
 : I know I’m not perfect, and I’m sure there are ways I can improve as a friend. But I don’t think applying for a highly desired position and rooting for myself to get it makes me bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is owning your shadow. David didn’t run from it at all. He didn’t deny it, downplay it, or try to convince anyone that he was a “good guy” who didn’t have these feelings. He just owned it. The powerful result of this is it allows us to be secure and self-assured. It makes us less afraid of what others will think and much less susceptible to their judgments. Because of that it’s a kind of superpower, and it comes from being willing to acknowledge and accept the unsightly, undesirable, and “unacceptable” parts of yourself.</p>
