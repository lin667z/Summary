<h3 class="Header-01">Asking for What You Want Witho<a id="_idTextAnchor045"></a>
 ut Guilt</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Unfortunately, many of us learned that asking for what we want is bad on some level. When I ask clients about their early memories around asking, they often have stories of parents being upset or annoyed with them. I used to judge these parents in my head–how could they be so insensitive and cruel? Didn’t they see how they were impacting their children?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then I had kids myself. At each stage of my kids’ development, I experience greater compassion for parents and a deeper humbling of myself. I used to secretly think to myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">My child will never do this. I’ll never be like that. I’d handle it way better.</span>
 Then six months later, or two years later, when my child is at that stage, I say to myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">Ohhhh, that’s what was happening for those parents…</span>
 and I take yet another superiority medal off my chest.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I have seen why asking often triggered our parents’ disapproval. Because kids ask for anything and everything all the time. And depending on their age and development, “ask” is a favorable way to say it. It’s more like demand. Or screech. And so, despite being a patient and loving dad, there are times when the rapid-fire demands and unpleasant situations mount to threshold capacity. Then I get annoyed. Instead of responding playfully when my son Zaim demands, “Daddy! Tell me a story!” for the fortieth time, I sigh, look tired and exasperated and say, “No. I don’t want to.” No redirection, no alternatives such as offering to read him a book, just a straight up, exhausted no.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Perhaps your parents were often exasperated by the demands of parenting and didn’t have much patience. Maybe they got even angrier and told you to knock it off, shut up, and get away from them. Whether it was subtle or overt, most people got the message that asking is bad. It’s too much, puts people out, and you’re bad and unlovable for doing it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unfortunately, this is absolutely untrue. <span class="CharOverride-10">Asking is an essential part of connecting with other humans, and is actually</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-18">the most effective way to meet our needs in relationships.</span>
 We misinterpreted our parent’s frustration and personalized it, thinking it was our fault. We did not understand how demanding life was for our parents and how Jedi-Zen master they would have to be to not get upset with us sometimes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It&apos;s time to upgrade our map of relationships yet again. Why is asking bad? Why do you feel guilty for simply asking for what you want? Do you fear others will judge your desire as needy or strange? Do you fear they’ll feel pressure to say yes and dislike you for it? Or is it just some vague, unexamined feelings of “badness” that bubble up whenever you think about asking for what you really want?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In almost all cases, guilt around asking comes down to poor boundaries. It starts with the idea that we shouldn&apos;t want so much and that other people&apos;s needs are more important than our own. This is one of the primary nice person strategies to stay small, stay safe, and just give everyone else what they want so they’ll love us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, we imagine that our request will put undue strain or burden on someone else. And we imagine they have poor boundaries as well and don&apos;t have the right to decide for themselves if they want to say yes or no. We fear they’ll feel pressured to say yes and be upset with us, resenting our demanding, selfish nature.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, we either don&apos;t ask and try to do it all ourselves, all the while piling up frustration, and repressed resentment. Or we consider asking, and feel guilty and bad, making the whole process painful and unpleasant. Even if we do muster the will to ask, and the other person says yes, we feel uneasy, wondering if they’re upset with us or secretly resent us. We have a hard time letting it in and accepting what they’re giving us. This can lead to apologizing or over thanking, neither of which makes anyone feel good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It&apos;s time for a new way. It&apos;s time to create a healthy sense of entitlement and to be better able to take care of your own needs and self-interest. We will explore this further in the next chapter, which is all about selfishness. For the moment, can you see the insanity of the current plan? Can you see how it only hurts you and doesn&apos;t create healthy, happy, sustainable relationships?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The ideal that you are striving for is noble–to be a giver, not a taker. In general, giving more than we take in life is a pattern that creates wealth, great relationships, and happiness. But giving does not mean <span class="CharOverride-9">only</span>
 giving and <span class="CharOverride-9">never</span>
 receiving. That turns an ideal into an extreme that is unattainable and unsustainable. If we only give and never get our needs met, we will soon feel burned out and resentful. This is true for any human, anywhere, at any time. It’s just part of the mechanics of the human animal.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to truly be a giving, generous, and attentive person, we must be able to meet our needs and receive from others. <span class="CharOverride-10">The most effective way to meet our needs is to ask directly for what we want.</span>
 Once our needs are met, or we feel the other person is responsive and cares about us, we feel energized and motivated to give them even more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The key to granting yourself permission to ask for what you want is to realize the following core truths:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. Your needs matter.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. You must be the greatest advocate of your own needs (no one else can do that for you).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">3. Others actually want to meet your needs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That last one is usually surprising for many nice people. They&apos;ve lived for so long with the stories that wanting and asking are selfish and repulsive, that they have become their reality. It can be shocking to realize that it&apos;s not necessarily how people around you think and feel. Let me share a little story that demonstrates a new reality in which people want to help you meet your needs.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Project: ULTRA</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Last summer I got a surge of motivation and inspiration and decided I was going to initiate what I now call Project: ULTRA. It involved completely planning our meals, diet, shopping list, and store trips. It also involved me waking up at 3:30a.m. to write this book, then go workout with a personal trainer from 5:00-6:00a.m., four days per week.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I cooked up the whole scheme one Wednesday afternoon and approached my wife that evening. She was excited about the meal plan, and ready to rock on eating super healthy, home-cooked, wholefood meals. The plan was for me to get back home before the boys woke up, so there would be little to no impact on her. So far, so good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Project: ULTRA began the very next week, and we’ve been doing it ever since. However, an unanticipated factor arose within several weeks of kicking off this health mastery initiative... Reciprocity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“You&apos;re working out four days per week,” she said one morning as we ate our breakfast of eggs and a mountain of steamed kale. “I want to go to Barre 3 classes.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Barre 3 is a group workout class that mixes yoga, Pilates, and ballet exercises. I went to several with Candace and was the only man among a sea of beautiful, fit, powerful women. Whilst they wore skin tight spandex pants and hit each move to the rhythm of the beat, I flailed around in my baggy Adidas sweatpants, trying not to fall over. Then I was sore for three days. That class is no joke.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I want my wife to be happy. I want her to be healthy and fit and full of energy, and I obviously understand that having equal workout time is a fair proposition. But, I also struggled with solo mornings with the boys. Cooking the breakfast, cleaning up the kitchen, and managing them both was serious business. Plus, Arman, our one-year-old, was in a phase of screeching at the top of his lungs if he didn&apos;t get continuous attention.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Ugh,” I replied. “How many days per week do you want to go?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well…” she paused, sensing my increasing resistance, “I could start with three.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But I could tell she wanted more, so I asked, “How many would you really want to do?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Five days per week,” she said. Her energy perked up as she said this. The good husband move was clear. So, I decided to do it. Not out of niceness, people pleasing, fear, or obligation to be fair. But because I love her and I want to help her meet her needs. I know if I do this, and she does the same for me, then we create an extraordinary relationship that only gets better over time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, for the first several weeks of this new arrangement I made sure to get pouty and irritable when she&apos;d leave for class in the morning. Not that I wanted to, I just couldn&apos;t help it. I was so miserable and I irrationally blamed her for my discomfort of having to be with my own two children by myself for 90 minutes each morning. Oh, the injustice!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After two weeks she asked me if we should change the plan, since I obviously wasn&apos;t handling it well. I stuck to my (mostly) good husband guns though.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No,” I replied. “This isn&apos;t a sign that you need to give something up. This is a sign that I need to keep growing and work through whatever is happening that makes me struggle in the mornings.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And that&apos;s just what I did. I learned how to relax and let go, how to get in a rhythm with my boys, and still take care of my own needs like eating and prepping food for work. Soon the mornings became routine and I ended up enjoying them more often than not. I felt grateful I got to spend so much time with my children in the mornings and evenings each day.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What&apos;s the moral of the story? Ask for what you want. The people around you care and want to support you, even if they complain and fight you on it sometimes. Stand up for yourself and ask for what you need, even if there&apos;s some initial friction.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">But what if my spouse isn&apos;t so good to me? What if he or she doesn&apos;t care about my needs and wouldn&apos;t do what you did?</span>
 Well, that&apos;s a big question with many possible answers. The simplest might be that you don&apos;t really advocate for yourself because you feel guilty and bad for doing so. As a result, you compromise in your own mind long before you ask for a watered-down version of what you originally wanted. This leads to a bubble of resentment that keeps you two apart and makes both of you less generous, loving, giving, and kind than you used to be with each other. Or, maybe he’s just an “immature bastard,” or she’s a “selfish bitch.” Who knows?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It doesn’t matter, because this is not about him, or her, or anyone else. This is about you. You need to start advocating for yourself and asking for what you want because no one else will. No one is stopping you because you’re not a victim of circumstance. You’re the owner of your life, the captain of your ship, and the mastery of your destiny.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You are the one who decides what is right and what is wrong for you. You can decide what it means to identify your own needs and ask for what you want. You can decide to see it as healthy and mature, and to reject the old ideas that it’s bad, selfish, mean, or wrong to do so.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The next chapter in this book will give you the insight, encouragement, and mental rewiring to stop always putting others first and to start taking care of yourself. You’re going to learn how to be more selfish in the most healthy, positive, and mutually beneficial ways, and it will transform your relationships and your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There is just one last thing we need to cover before we conclude this chapter on speaking up.</p>
