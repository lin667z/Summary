<h4 class="Header-02">Relish the Discomfort</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Since discomfort is inevitable, and moving into it by choice actually makes us more powerful and free, we might as well enjoy it. Now, I know that might sound crazy, but let’s see how that could actually become a reality.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Imagine you’re in a conversation with someone and there’s a moment of silence. In that moment, you aren’t sure what to say. It looks like they aren’t either. You start to feel awkward, with a growing sense of pressure to come up with something else to say. In other words, discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Our typical response to these kinds of situations is to react with an internal: <span class="CharOverride-9">Blegh! Make it stop! Make it go away!</span>
 We generally perceive it as a bad thing that is somehow harmful or damaging to us. But what if you turned towards it. What if you said to yourself, “Yes! This is so awkward! Bring it on!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How on earth could you do such an insane thing? Because you know it’s actually good for you. It’s just like lifting weights or working out in any other fashion. When you’re in that moment of pushing through a challenging set, or hitting a wall on the fifth mile of your run, you have two choices. You can start fighting it: <span class="CharOverride-9">Ugh! This is too hard. It’s too hot out. I can’t do this. I hate this exercise. When am I going to be done?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can lean into it. You push harder and feel the burn because you know that leaning into the edge of your capacity will make you grow. If you can lift that weight now, you’ll be able to lift more later. If you pump those legs and feel that burn in your chest as you run, and you keep going, then you’ll be able to run further and faster in the future. You move towards the discomfort because you know it’s making you stronger.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What if you started seeing emotional discomfort that way? What if you approached awkwardness, embarrassment, fear, challenge, conflict, and all the other things you used to be scared of in the same way? You just might find that you start to enjoy it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After doing years of a technique called Embarrassment Inoculation, I’ve found I actually relish the experience of embarrassment. Embarrassment Inoculation is a method of eliminating your fear of what other people think of you by intentionally doing things that embarrass you. These might include lying down on a busy sidewalk, dancing on a street corner, or trying to order a pizza at Baskin Robbins ice cream shop. You do things that <span class="CharOverride-9">will</span>
 draw attention, and <span class="CharOverride-9">will</span>
 draw judgment. On purpose. And by doing so, you discover that it’s no big deal and you can handle whatever happens.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s a profoundly liberating experience and I have everyone at my live weekend events get a chance to practice doing this. Reading about it is one thing, but actually doing it repeatedly over the course of three days is entirely different, and life-transforming.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Having done these types of exercises myself for years, I’ve essentially burnt out my embarrassment circuit. As in, it’s very difficult for to do something that makes me feel embarrassed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Just recently I was with a client in a 1-on-1 VIP day, and we were out in the streets of Portand on a beautiful, sunny spring day. We were playing a game where we took turns telling the other person who to walk up to and what to say. He told me to chase down a delivery man pulling a cart of soda cans and snacks and ask him if I could pull his cart for a minute. I did, and the guy put his head down, walked faster, and didn’t look at me. Perhaps he thought I was trying to hijack his palette of soda.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then my client told me to walk over to a woman on her cell phone and ask her what she was talking about. Done and done.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Excuse me,” I said, leaning my head forward to get into her peripheral vision.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m on the phone,” she said, sternly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I know,” I said, nodding. “Who are you talking to?” I asked in a loud whisper.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“A friend,” she said, furrowing her brow.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Awkward city. I could feel her resistance to me talking with her. And yet the challenge was to find out what she was talking about, so my job wasn’t done.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I gotcha. What are you guys talking about?” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That’s none of your business,” she said firmly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Fair enough,” I said, cheerily, and walked off.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would never have been able to have this sort of thing years ago. I would have been too terrified, too mortified, or both. The embarrassment would have destroyed me. And now, I felt no embarrassment whatsoever. I found the entire exchange fascinating and amusing. I liked her boundaries and her use of the phrase, “that’s none of your business.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, asking strangers random and strange questions could be a cool party trick, but is not likely your ultimate goal. But what doors could it open up? I remember one instance in graduate school when I was out to dinner with a group of friends. Two women in the group were discussing a couple at a nearby table, and playfully debating over what date the couple was on. Was it their first date, fifth date, or were they a long-term couple? Each one was offering her opinion, based on cleverly deduced clues. At some point the debate petered out and they seemed to be done.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Do you guys want to find out who was right?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“How would you do that?” One of my friends asked me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“By asking them,” I said, slightly amused at her question.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No!” One of them exclaimed. As if doing so was somehow wrong or dangerous.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I smiled. She needed to read my future book.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’ll be right back,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I walked over towards the couple and with a smile said, “Excuse me.” They looked up, curious.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“A few of my friends couldn’t help but notice you from over there,” I said as I gestured towards my group of friends. The two women who’d been discussing the couple smiled sheepishly. Well, one of them smiled. The one who’d exclaimed “No!” at the idea of me approaching the couple directly looked more like she was grimacing. Good. The benefits of Embarrassment Inoculation are partially transferable, even if you’re just observing the experience.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“You guys are a beautiful couple. Have you been together a long time, or just recently started dating?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">They both smiled and lit up. “We’ve been together about three months,” the woman said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Wow, that’s great,” I said. “How did you two meet?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We ended up having a ten-minute conversation about their relationship. They were so sweet and open, and excited to share. When you approach people with boldness, curiosity, and positive energy, the world is a friendly place.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What could open up for you in your life if you leaned into discomfort? If you no longer recoiled or fled, but instead moved towards the very thing that scared you, what would you find on the other side?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may have an intuitive sense, or some guesses. There’s only one way to really find out for sure. Start getting into that ice shower.</p>
