<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One of the biggest obstacles to acting in our healthy self-interest is simply the discomfort of doing so. Most nice people, I’ve discovered, tend to be sensitive humans. I myself am very sensitive, a term I used to find mildly offensive as a man. Early in our relationship, my wife would occasionally comment on my sensitivity and I’d take it as an insult. She had to clarify, on several occasions, that she was actually complimenting me. Unconvinced, I looked the word up and found it simply means being more responsive to the environment, which definitely describes me. It may describe you as well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This means you have the capacity to see into others, hence the title of this section. While a less sensitive person may speak with someone and move on, oblivious to that person’s emotional state, you might be the opposite. You may be able to see someone is sad as you speak with them, even if they’re trying to hide it. You can also pick up on anxiety, anger, hurt, and other feelings in others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What you notice in others might impact your own emotional state. If you can see the sadness in someone else, you may start to <span class="CharOverride-9">feel</span>
 their sadness. This is what some people refer to as being an “empath” or “highly sensitive person.”<span class="Footnotes-1 CharOverride-11">

<p class="body-paragraph">Thus, being a sensitive person can make acting in your self-interest challenging, especially if someone else feels disappointed or sad as a result. You feel their disappointment so strongly that it can be hard to stay aware of yourself and what you need. The boundaries between you and them start to blur.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But boundaries are exactly what you need to help you in this situation. You can start by using what you learned in the boundaries chapter, especially around letting go of over-responsibility. In addition, be sure to practice the Peace Process and Energy Bubble meditations. These can help you create space between you and other people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, most importantly, do not stop. Just because the other person feels pain, or you feel discomfort, does not mean something has gone wrong. It does not even mean you should change your mind and do whatever you need to in order to smooth things over. Stay the course. Set your sights for healthy self-interest and take small strides towards your target. If you experience a wave of empathic suffering or guilt, return to this book and use it as an affirming guide to keep you on the path. Trust me, it does get easier.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even though I’m still a sensitive person, I have more choice around how to use those abilities now. I can use it to tune into the emotions of clients, my wife, children, and those I connect with to serve them more powerfully. I can also wave my hand, say “Whatever, they’ll be fine,” and dismiss a guilty thought or impulse to take responsibility for others. And this often helps me let go and move on. Except when it doesn’t. Then I have more inner work to do as I head due north towards healthier self-interest.</p>

 . To read more about this topic, I highly recommend the author Judith Orloff, MD. Her book The Empath’s Suvrival Guide is full of practical tools to help manage sensitivity.</p>
