<h4 class="Header-02">Your New List</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If you could wave a magic wand and instantly become free of fear, guilt, or the need to make others see you a certain way, how would you be? Take a moment to ponder that one. Let anything and everything come to your mind. Don’t try to determine if it’s the most intelligent or “best” way to behave, just let your fantasies run wild for a moment. Imagine you are completely free of worrying about what anyone thinks of you. You are completely relaxed, comfortable, and confident in yourself no matter what… What would you do? Take two minutes now to really think about that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, let’s turn some of those images and ideas into a quick list. Just write out a list of things you might do if you had no fear, no guilt, and no doubt in yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, maybe you were seeing images of yourself smiling at others as you met them, being charming and smooth. Maybe you saw yourself interrupting and shutting down Andy, that jerk who always interrupts you at work, or telling off Janet for all those times she lied to you. Maybe you imagined yourself being a head honcho or powerful leader in your work or career.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If this were the case, then your list would look like this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d smile and be charming with people I just met.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d interrupt Andy and give Janet a piece of my mind.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d be a powerful leader in my company.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Make sense? Don’t overthink it, just keep it quick and simple. And don’t censor it or make it look pretty. This is not for anyone else, and this isn’t a polished mission statement or ten-year plan. This is just for you. As always, I’ll play along too. Because if I’m not getting a little uncomfortable, and getting my hands dirty, then how am I growing right alongside you as we do this? So here we go. Let’s both go make our lists. Start with this phrase at the top of the page:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“If I had no fear, guilt, or doubt, I would…”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ready? Let’s do it now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Good. How did it go? Was it easy to come up with things? Hard to imagine? Did it make you uncomfortable in some way even to create the list? Sometimes just imaging being more fearless, badass, and guilt-free induces fear and guilt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Don’t worry about that. As long as you were able to create something, you’re in good shape. If not, then I’m afraid you will die a terrible, terrible death. No, I’m kidding. But you won’t get nearly as much out of this section, or this book if you’re just a passive viewer along for the ride. If you step up, play full out, and are willing to do whatever it takes, then you will break through to a new level of power and confidence that will make all the work worth it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I noticed that my list was just a few things at first. I sat back and smugly congratulated myself. It must be because I’ve done so much boldness training and confronted so many of my fears that I indeed do most of the things I’m scared of. I clearly am awesome. And then I thought of something else to add. And then something else. And I started to reflect on my recent interactions–with colleagues, clients, and people I just met. I started to see the subtle ways I still hold myself back out of fear, or niceness. And my list grew. Here’s what I came up with:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d email my list about group openings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d email my list about things more often in general.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would personally invite 10 people to my Mastermind program.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would more passionately tell people about what I did for work, what my mission is.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would talk more about my accomplishments.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would be even less nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would change the subject more often.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would end conversations more quickly with some people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d say what I was perceiving more during conversations, even with people I just met.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would be even more irreverent, and make more jokes, even with people I just met.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d amuse myself more in conversations.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would challenge, call out, or give direct feedback to certain clients more often.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would say whatever needs to be said in order to serve, even if that upset a client or led them to want to stop working with me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would interrupt and redirect certain clients more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would talk and teach more during group calls when I felt like it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d be even less flexible with my schedule and say no more, even if that meant losing a client.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would say no to way more things.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d make this book as long as I feel it needs to be, without cutting parts out to make sure people can get through it quickly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d prioritize fun, fascination, love, and contribution over everything else, even if that means earning less money.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d ask my mentors direct questions and bring up the challenges I have with some of the things they say or teach.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You know you’re on the right track when you start to feel a little (or very) nervous as you write your list.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This list in itself is extremely valuable. It gives you a window into all the ways you could grow. It highlights what is outside of your comfort zone, and all the ways you could become more bold and powerful right now. But we want to go even further. This list could change. Some of these items you may actually want to do, and some you might not want to do. Some might be outrageous or unwise to do at this time. I don’t know what’s on your list; but I do know this list points to your core desire to be a free, expressive, authentic human. This is more important than the specific items on your list. This is about your right to say, do, and be what you please—your rights as a liberated human.</p>
