the Approval Quest</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">“You can be the ripest, juiciest peach in the world,<br/>
and there’s still going to be someone who hates peaches.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-4">- Dita Von Teese</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">By now you are probably aware that an endless quest to get people to like you is somewhat misguided. You might be seeing how strong your desire for approval has been, and how this desire has reduced your authenticity, power, and sense of freedom around others. It also leads to feeling uncomfortable in your own skin, and generally being dissatisfied with social interactions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And yet, simply seeing the need for approval doesn’t necessarily make it stop. After reading the second chapter in this book, which highlighted the Approval Seeker in all of us, you may have thought: <span class="CharOverride-9">Yes, I can see this isn’t helping me. But, how do I stop?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The simple answer is to build power and self-esteem, which happens to be exactly what you’re learning in this section of the book, so that’s good. And it starts, like many things, with having boundaries.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At its core, the excessive need for approval is a boundary problem. Mine and yours is not clearly defined. Thus, your opinion becomes my opinion. You think my shoes look stupid? Now I think my shoes look stupid. It goes the other way as well: my opinion becomes your opinion (or so I imagine). I have funny looking teeth and my ears are too big. Now I imagine you are looking at my teeth and ears and judging them as funny looking and too big, respectively. Or perhaps it’s the opposite. You think my teeth are too big and my ears are funny looking. In any case, it’s bad. I’m bad. I suck.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These poorly defined boundaries make us very susceptible to the perceptions of others. In order to fully free ourselves from incessant approval seeking, we need to strengthen those boundaries.</p>
