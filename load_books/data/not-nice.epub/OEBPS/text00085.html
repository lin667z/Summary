for Yourself</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Until now we’ve been discussing speaking up in general terms. Now, let’s get into the details, specifics, and how-tos of actually doing it in the situations that matter most to you in your life. Overall, there are four kinds of speaking up for ourselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. <span class="CharOverride-10">Sharing Freely Socially:</span>
 This includes speaking your mind, sharing about yourself and your life, asking what you are really curious about, speaking up in groups, and generally feeling empowered to throw in your two cents in any social situation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. <span class="CharOverride-10">Speaking Up at Work:</span>
 This includes speaking up in settings like meetings, among colleagues and peers, with potential clients and customers, or with supervisors, bosses, executive members, and other “higher ups.” To be able to clearly and directly ask key questions and share your ideas so you can add value and make an impact.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">3. <span class="CharOverride-10">Objections, Disagreement, &amp; Other “Difficult Conversations”:</span>
 This can be in any relationship–business or personal. It involves noticing when you don’t like something, or are upset, and being able to clearly and directly communicate this with the right person or people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">4. <span class="CharOverride-10">Asking for What You Want:</span>
 This involves approaching others and asking for what you want, without shame or guilt. This can be in a work or business setting, with family and friends, or with your spouse or romantic partner.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you read this list, which ones stand out to you? Is there one area where you already feel free to speak up? Perhaps you crush it at work and boldly share your ideas there, but are extremely uncomfortable and restricted sharing yourself when meeting new people, or out on a date. Or maybe it’s the other way around. You’re great at asking for what you want in your relationship, but you’re terrified to speak up in a room of “senior management” and other people who have more experience than you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, if you are thinking, <span class="CharOverride-9">man, I need to speak up in all of these areas!</span>
 Well then, you’re in the right place. Let’s dive into each one with specific strategies and examples, to give you a clear sense of how you can begin speaking up for yourself in any situation, starting right now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But before we do, I have to mention one <span class="CharOverride-9">extremely important</span>
 thing. If you don’t get this one distinction, your progress towards speaking up for yourself will be slow or nonexistent. How important is it? Super, duper important. Are you ready to know what it is, so you can finally break free and become the bold, expressive, unapologetic, fulfilled person you’re meant to be?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You learn this by doing. <span class="CharOverride-10">You learn the skill of speaking up for yourself, by practicing speaking up for yourself.</span>
 There is no other way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Below you will find guidance, strategies, and examples. Things you can do and put into practice today. But only if you’re willing to step outside the familiar comfort zone and actually do them. Reading about them, accumulating more knowledge on the exact right way to do it, and all the rest, will not set you free. Only action will.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Like all skills, if we’re new at it, we might not be awesome at first. It might be a little clunky, or messy, or awkward a few times. Or a lot of times. And that’s OK. That’s the only way to really get good at this. Could you learn the guitar without ever missing a note, without ever messing up a chord? Absolutely not. That would be an insane expectation and would severely limit your progress. Yet that’s how many people approach learning to speak up and be assertive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let that go now. Let yourself be a beginner. Let yourself learn, and be messy, and make mistakes, and keep going and growing. That is the path to mastery, and that is the path you are on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now that I’ve banged the Action-Drum yet again, let’s turn our attention to the ins and outs of speaking up.</p>
