Sexual Attraction</h3>

<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Nothing reduces attraction more than too much niceness. When one person in a relationship sacrifices themselves, doesn’t speak up or ask for what they want, and feels guilt and fear about being themselves, it doesn’t go well. It’s even worse if both people are doing it. Because as you’ve seen in this book (and perhaps your own life), doing so kills confidence and builds resentment. And low confidence and high resentment doesn’t exactly put people in the mood for romance.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Conversely, being more direct, bold, outspoken, and authentic does put people in the mood for romance. These behaviors create powerful attraction that draws people together and lasting passion that sustains relationships for a lifetime. In fact, the original subtitle for this book was: <span class="CharOverride-9">Why Saying No and Being More Selfish Makes You More Sought After, Sexier, and Highly Successful In Life.</span>
 Let’s take a look now at some of the key reasons for why this is.</p>
