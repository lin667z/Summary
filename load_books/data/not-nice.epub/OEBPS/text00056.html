 ant?</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This is one of the most valuable questions you can ask yourself. Asking it regularly and often about all areas of your life will serve you greatly. From where you want to go to dinner, to how you want to spend time with someone, to the kind of work you want to do in the world, this question will guide you well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of the best ways to determine what you do want is to start with where your mind naturally goes, which is usually what you <span class="CharOverride-9">don’t</span>
 want. In the neighbor example above, you might not have been clear on exactly what you wanted in your interaction. But you sure know what you didn’t want. You didn’t want him to step on your flowers or pick your fruit. And maybe you didn’t even want him to come over to your yard in the first place.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you see what you don’t want, you can start to ask yourself: <span class="CharOverride-9">What is it that I’d prefer instead? What do I really want?</span>
 Then pay attention to what answers emerge, without dismissing or filtering them. Let yourself explore, get curious, and find out what’s really going on inside. You’re listening inwards for guidance, rather than simply focusing on what everyone else wants and what a “good boy” or “good girl” would do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you do this over time, you’ll start to discover what you like and dislike. You’ll get to know yourself better and have more clarity in your life. You will become more decisive, which is a great benefit to you and everyone around you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If indecisiveness is something you struggle with, then you especially need to be asking yourself these questions throughout the day: <span class="CharOverride-9">What do I want? What don’t I want in this situation? What do I prefer? What sounds good to me?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Asking these questions will help you become more aware and connected with yourself. This is essential because <span class="CharOverride-10">chronic indecisiveness is a result of being disconnected or alienated from your true self.</span>
 You don’t even know what’s happening deep in there. There’s too much noise about what he wants, she wants, they want. What mom said is good and dad said is bad. What a godly or spiritual person should think, feel, and want. There’s too many variables to decide clearly, and so you leave it up to others, saying, “I don’t know, what do you want to do?” You’re scared of picking something and it looking bad, or them not liking it, or of making a mistake and choosing the “wrong thing.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Occasionally not having clarity and letting others decide is natural, and not problematic. But if it’s your default setting, then it’s a sign of too much niceness and low social power. Over time it can irritate and repel others and backfire as most people-pleasing strategies do. This is because always letting others decide puts the responsibility on them. They now have to decide for themselves and for you, but they don’t really know where you stand because you don’t share. This creates frustration, annoyance, and a desire for less contact.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But we let others decide for us because we’ve learned, somewhere along the way, that discovering what we want and asking for it is somehow bad, wrong, or selfish. That doing so is somehow inconsiderate of others, and is bad for our relationships. This, as with all the nice person programming, is not true. It’s an inaccurate map of human relationships. If we follow it, it will steer us way off track, into the outback of loneliness, pain, poor relationships, resentment, physical pain, and Lord knows what else. Let’s clear up some of those negative and highly restrictive stories about wanting right now.</p>
