<h4 class="Header-02">Complete Self-Interest (CSI)</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Do you remember Jason’s story from just a few pages back? As he agonized over the particulars of exactly how and when to end his relationship, I could hear a major problem. He was not in himself. No, I don’t mean this in some science fiction or astral travel sort of way. Psychologically, his focal point was his partner, not himself. He was imagining all of his actions as they would be interpreted and felt by her. In short, he was missing from the equation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To bring him back, I re-oriented him to the complete opposite end of the spectrum.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Just as an experiment, let’s say you were going to operate from your own complete self-interest–where every choice was based entirely on what was easiest, most desirable, or best sounding to you, regardless of how she felt–what would you do? What would CSI Jason do?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">He laughed in response to my reference to the cheesy police show on TV. This question gave him permission to go inward and find out what he really wanted. It helped him step out of his old perspective, in which his actions were always guided by what he thought others wanted.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I would wait three weeks until after the holidays, then I would end the relationship. I wouldn’t go on the trip we had planned. I’d rent myself an AirBnB so I could get away after having the breakup conversation. Then I’d come back a week later and start moving all my stuff out.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In that moment, everything shifted. His voice tone was completely different. The hesitancy, uncertainty, and long pauses were gone. His pitch was even deeper. He was reconnected with himself, his desire, and his power. He was back in.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But isn’t this bad, selfish, wrong, and inconsiderate? This is what Jason had been telling himself for years. This is what you may be telling yourself every day. Unfortunately, it’s a misguided attempt at being a noble, “good” human being. In fact, it’s actually rooted in fear and makes you even more selfish. Here’s how:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Jason is focused on keeping his partner happy and remaining in the relationship because he does not want her to feel pain, right? In reality, <span class="CharOverride-9">he</span>
 does not want to feel pain. In fact, when she’s hurting he feels not only pain, but a particularly intense form of shame. As we explored this more, it turned out his shame was telling him he failed at taking away all her pain and making her feel happy. She had a rough life growing up, and he felt it was his responsibility to show her that the world was a good place, that men could be trusted, and that she could finally feel happy with him. So, when he no longer wants to be with her, he is failing her, and he isn’t a good enough man.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If she totally lost it after their breakup and went into a spiral of addiction, his guilt and shame would only intensify. He was scared of those feelings. He was also scared of her being angry at him, and judging him as a bad or selfish man. He was afraid of her friends thinking negatively of him, and them discussing how bad and selfish he is over brunch. Who is all this really about? Her or him? Who is he <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 most focused on?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The truth is he is already causing her pain in the relationship. No matter how much he thinks he’s hiding his discontent and playing the role of happy boyfriend, she feels that something is off. In general, women are more perceptive, intuitive, and emotionally aware than men. If something’s off, they feel it. Even if they don’t think about it consciously. Who knows how much her dissatisfaction in her friendships, job, and life are the result of her partner not really loving her for who she is?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And that’s just short-term pain. In the long-term, delaying the breakup is one of the most painful things to do to someone you love. Those two, or three, or ten years that you are just biding your time and planning your escape are years lost for you both. Jason’s girlfriend could be building a new relationship with someone who’s a better fit. The longer he waits, the more pain is created.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">In most cases trying to be nice and pleasing people are just self-focused ways to avoid fear and discomfort.</span>
 They provide short-term relief for us, but long-term pain in others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I saw this play out dozens of times in my own dating life. I would be warm, enthusiastic, and totally interested in everything she shared. I would be affirming, positive, and upbeat. I did this because I wanted her to feel good. Or so I thought. In truth, I also did this so she would like me, and so I could think of myself as a “good person.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Being this way with someone isn’t necessarily bad, if it’s authentic. But I would portray this energy, even if I didn’t fully believe it myself. Because I had to, in order to be a good person and to get her to like me, remember? This would continue for weeks, sometimes months. I was the perfect guy. I made her feel deeply loved, special, and maybe like she was the one.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then I’d leave. Often quickly and abruptly, with no solid explanation to satisfy her confused mind, let alone her aching heart. I know I caused many of these women great pain. I’m sure many of them asked themselves questions like: <span class="CharOverride-9">It was so good, what happened? What did I do wrong? Did I not see something?</span>
 For some it may have undermined their sense of trust in men–<span class="CharOverride-9">can I really believe what he is portraying?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It took me many years to learn what you are learning in this book, to see that becoming clear on what I actually want, and then directly sharing that with others is beneficial. That looking at a situation with Complete Self-Interest helps me know where I stand so I can fully engage in a relationship with someone that is mutually rewarding. Paradoxically, the more you come from this place, the more you are able to freely decide when and how much you want to give. You will end up being more loving, generous, and giving than you ever were as a struggling nice person.</p>
