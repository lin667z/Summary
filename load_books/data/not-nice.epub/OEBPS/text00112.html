<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">You are responsible for meeting your own needs. This means being able to uncover what you want and need in a situation, and then take effective steps to get it. If you want attention, you decide how you can skillfully ask for it and receive it. If you want safety or certainty, you protect yourself or ease your fears. If you want to be touched in a certain way by your partner, you explore what it is you really want and ask them for it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This may sound obvious and simplistic, but many of us don’t operate as if it were. Instead, we ignore our needs, desires, and wants or just keep them to ourselves. We dismiss them as excessive, unnecessary, or burdensome to others. But this doesn’t make them go away. We give up our power to meet our own needs, which is one of the hallmarks of being an adult: the capacity to take care of ourselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we deny our own needs and wants, we impair our ability to meet them skillfully and we become more like young children. We’re unable to ask for what we want and need. My son, Zaim, who’s three years old, is at the age now where he will sometimes groan and yell when he’s upset. We have to guide him to slow down, breathe, and tell us what he wants. “Can you say what you want, buddy?” Your parents’ might have used the classic phrase: Use your words.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In any case, this is what we revert to when we don’t take responsibility for meeting our own needs. Doing this does not make you selfless, altruistic, or a “good person.” It hurts you and greatly impairs your relationships, thus hurting others. It makes others have to take care of you more instead of you taking care of yourself, which ultimately frustrates them and pushes them away.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s time to stop secretly hoping that if we’re nice enough and good enough, our needs will magically be met. That others will be perceptive and check in with us: “Hi friend, what do you need today?” While this may happen occasionally, it usually does not. When it doesn’t, we become frustrated, hurt, or angry inside. We judge others as selfish, self-absorbed, or totally clueless. And we feel powerless.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s time to step up and take full responsibility. No one can care as much about your internal, moment-to-moment experience as you can. Because they’re not in it. They’re not in your body, in your mind, and in your heart, experiencing everything you are. They have their own internal experience to feel and navigate. You are responsible for you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That means deciding, right here and now as you read this page, that you will shift your priorities and put yourself first. You no longer confuse self-denial with being a good person. You see clearly that always putting others first creates deep resentment, destroys your happiness, and is unsustainable. And you acknowledge that putting yourself first allows you to meet your needs in the most skillful way. This, in turn, increases your happiness, joy, and capacity to love, so you can give freely and create healthy relationships.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Many times per day, ask yourself the questions you’ve learned so far in this book: <span class="CharOverride-9">What do I want? What do I need? How can I take care of myself?</span>
 Then, instead of dismissing the answers, pay attention to them. Come up with a plan of how to get what you want and meet your needs. With your newfound powers of bold assertion, you have a direct route to do exactly that in a skillful and effective manner.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You just might find that you’re better at uncovering your needs and meeting them than you realized. This is often the case with my clients because the main obstacle is simply the belief that putting yourself first is bad. Once they see the insanity of the self-denying patterns, and they give themselves complete permission to take care of themselves, it becomes easy and natural to do so.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you follow these steps and take more responsibility, you’ll let others do the same. As you stop playing the victim of circumstance, you will stop seeing others as victims. You’ll think to yourself: <span class="CharOverride-9">I have power and you have power. Let’s both use it.</span>
 Thus, by being clear on what you are really responsible for, you will let go of what you’re not responsible for.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">You’re not responsible for other people’s feelings, wants, desires, and needs. You do not have to meet everyone’s needs.</span>
 You don’t have to do everything that someone wants you to do. You don’t have to do <span class="CharOverride-9">anything</span>
 that someone wants, if it is not right for you. You’re not responsible for meeting their needs–they are. You doing something for them is just one possible way for them to meet their needs. If you say no, then it’s their responsibility to find a different way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This last paragraph is worth reading and re-reading many times. Underline and highlight it. Write out the first few sentences on a sticky note and put it somewhere you’ll see it often. It’s a new way of being in the world, a less nice way, that might take some reinforcement.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When it does, you become free. You’re no longer controlled by the invisible forces of obligation and guilt. You reclaim your power and realize you always have choice. You remember that you are a cause in this world, not an effect. As a cause, you must get clear on what you want, and you must claim what you want with clarity, conviction, and power. Without apology or shame.</p>
