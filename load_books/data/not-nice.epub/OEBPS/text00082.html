<h4 class="Header-02">The Three Modes of Communication</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Which of these reasons resonate with you? Which two or three are the ones that hold you back most? Can you think of any others that are not on this list that keep you from speaking up?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Regardless of which particular ones influence you most, they all lead to the same result: staying silent. This puts you into the first major category of communication: passive.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Passive Pants</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Being passive is really your only option if you don&apos;t want any of the feared outcomes listed in the chart above. If you&apos;ve been taught, or convinced yourself, that speaking up is high risk with many possible negative outcomes, you will avoid doing so.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This forces you into the passive stance. In this mode of communication, you don’t speak up for yourself, say what you like or dislike, or ask for what you want. But this poses a dilemma, because you are a human animal with natural desires and needs. So how do you attempt to meet these? Why, passively of course.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This means we silently hope people will know what we want and give it to us. We have internal hopes and silent agreements such as: <span class="CharOverride-9">If I&apos;m nice enough to you, then you&apos;ll give me what I want, without me having to ask for it. If I give you attention when you want it, then you&apos;ll give me the same when I want it. I won&apos;t say I want attention, I&apos;ll just imply it or suggest it and you&apos;ll pick up on the hint and give it to me.</span>
 So, goes the plan at least…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If we don&apos;t get what we want, or if someone does something we don&apos;t like, we get angry. This anger remains internal, however. Because to share it or show it leads to painful or threatening outcomes, so we dare not do that. So where does it go? Down into our bodies, messing with our energy levels and overall mood. But it also comes out. It has to. As humans, we must find a way to get what we want and express ourselves, no matter how much we fear the consequences.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The only way to express anger while in the passive mode is indirectly. This way we can always deny that we were angry. For example, we might let out a heavy sigh when asked to do something. If the person asks us if something is wrong we say, “no, I’m fine.” We might be more distant, share less, be harder to get a hold of, or otherwise withdraw from the relationship. Or we might make slightly cutting comments or jokes that have an edge or sting to them. Or we may say things that induce guilt in others, subtly implying they’re taking too much, not appreciative, or otherwise hurting us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When asked or confronted about any of this, we simply deny it. And for many people who are rooted in the passive mode, they might not even be aware they are doing it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This kind of behavior has been labeled “passive-aggressive” and has a negative connotation in our culture. No one wants to be accused of behaving that way. But that way of being is inevitable if we don&apos;t have permission to speak up. Someone who&apos;s communicating anger passively is not a bad person. They’re just scared. Actually, they’re terrified. Terrified that if they were to freely share what they think, directly ask for what they want, and reveal themselves, that they will be harshly rejected, ridiculed, abandoned, or some similar terrible consequence. This creates an invisible prison that limits all interactions and is a great source of suffering. I would know, since this was my mode of choice for more than ten years.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The core mindset of the passive mode is this: <span class="CharOverride-9">Other people&apos;s wants and needs matter more than my own. Speaking up is dangerous and generally leads to bad outcomes. It&apos;s best to be nice—extra nice—and then others will give you what you want and life will flow your way. Besides, I don&apos;t want to be one of those aggressive assholes anyway.</span>
</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Aggressive Asshole</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The other side of the spectrum is to be aggressive. This is a take-no-prisoners, no-holds-barred approach to communication. The core mindset of the aggressive mode is: <span class="CharOverride-9">In life, you figure out what you want and you just take it. Don&apos;t let anyone stand in your way or treat you without the respect you deserve. My needs matter, yours are inconsequential.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, most of us don&apos;t think of it this way when we’re in the aggressive mode. Very few people consciously identify as an “asshole.” Instead, we have a good rationale for how we’re behaving.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This person didn&apos;t get that report back to me in time. My kids were screaming too much. He showed up an hour later than he said he would. I deserve this position more than she does, I&apos;ve worked harder to get here. Regardless of our reasoning, we are in it to win it. We’re there to control the situation and the outcome as much as possible. We say and do what we need to, long term consequences be damned.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We berate our assistant for giving us the report late, yell at our kids to make them shut up, tell our friend he&apos;s always late and an inconsiderate jerk, and launch a calculated campaign to smear the image of our colleague. <span class="CharOverride-9">It&apos;s only fair. I deserve it. They didn&apos;t do it right. They should have done this or that instead. My treatment of them is the result of their poor actions.</span>
 Or so our story goes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It&apos;s rare for someone to spend their entire lives in just one mode. Hence, many people who are predominantly passive will hold all their anger and frustration inside, only to go crazy-balls Hulk at a random time in their life. Often times the aggression comes out most with family, children, spouses, and other people who are unlikely to leave us (at least right away). Passive with our boss, aggressive with our kids, for example.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Some people do spend the majority of their time in the aggressive mode of communication. It&apos;s unlikely they would pick up this book, however. Most likely you are more passive than you&apos;d like to be in many situations and sometimes blow up and act aggressively. And that&apos;s OK. It doesn&apos;t mean you&apos;re a bad person. It means you&apos;re human, and similar to the vast majority of people. As your self-awareness grows, your courage increases, and your map of relationships upgrades, you’ll find your way more and more to the third mode of communication: assertiveness.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">The Middle Way: Assertiveness</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If passive is on the far left of the pendulum swing and aggressive is on the far right, then assertiveness would be in the middle. It combines the beneficial elements of both the passive and aggressive modes of communication. The core mindset of assertiveness is: <span class="CharOverride-9">My needs matter and so do yours. Let’s have a clear discussion about what we both want to see, what might work best for us both. Sometimes I will choose what serves me, even if it upsets you. And sometimes you will do something for yourself, even if I don’t like it. That’s just how relationships work.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This realistic approach to communication requires that we know what we want. Hence the focus earlier in this book on helping you cultivate a habit of identifying what you want in a given situation. Once we are aware of this, we speak up to actively pursue our wants and needs. This is similar in some ways to the aggressive mode of communication. We know what we want and we go for it. The major difference is we are more aware of others as we do so. We want to know what they want, and we want to see if we can create a win-win agreement. If that’s not possible, and a decision we want to make generates negative feelings in another, we want to hear the other person and acknowledge their feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This capacity to hear another’s perspective and be influenced by it is similar to the passive mode. The difference is when we’re assertive, we don’t instantly change what we’re doing to please them. In fact, you might decide to proceed, even though they’re upset. This is a key area where assertiveness differs greatly from passivity. When we’re passive, we don’t go after what we want in the first place, let alone continue forward when someone wants us to stop.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There is great power in the assertive mode of communication. We can be more direct, more up front, and clear. We reduce patterns of beating around the bush and implying things, and instead simply say more of what we really mean. This makes us much more effective communicators. It also helps you get more of what you want. And, surprisingly, it actually makes others like you more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This last insight is your key to liberating your voice so you can speak up freely and powerfully in any situation that matters. Most of us who lived in the passive mode learned that this is the “best” way to be. This makes you a nice person who is good and will be liked and loved by others for that goodness. You have the distorted idea that to veer off that path means you’re instantly an aggressive asshole who is despicable and hurtful. The truth is there is a third way that is respectful, increases your self-esteem, and creates healthy, mutually rewarding relationships in your personal and professional life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to give yourself permission to step off the passive path and fully dive into assertiveness, however, you’re going to have to upgrade your map of relationships.</p>
