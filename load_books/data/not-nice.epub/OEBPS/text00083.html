 de Your Map</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">It’s time to upgrade your map my friend. Like those old globes that have the Soviet Union on them, yours might portray things that no longer exist. The map I’m referring to in this case is your internal map of relationships. Just like a map of a city on your computer screen represents some real place in the outer world, you have an internal map that represents the terrain of relationships. It’s our understanding of relationships: how they work, what things mean, and what we predict will happen based on how we behave.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, let’s say you’re driving somewhere new and following the GPS directions on your phone. It is using a map to guide you to your destination. When it says, “turn left and your destination will be on the right,” most likely you will turn left and your destination will be there on the right, just like the robot hive-brain predicted (which will most likely someday be our tyrannical overlord in a twist of irony, but that’s a different story). This map accurately predicted what will happen when you turn left, and so you got to where you wanted to be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When it comes to our internal map of relationships, however, I’m afraid it’s often not so accurate. In fact, we have dozens of errors in our map that guide us all over the place, far from our destination. Our map might say: <span class="CharOverride-9">If I express anger, others will find a way to hurt me</span>
 , so we avoid all actions that might lead to conflict or difficult conversations. Or our map tells us: <span class="CharOverride-9">If I disappoint someone, they’ll fire me, dump me, or leave me in some way.</span>
 This guides us towards people-pleasing, leaves us permanently on edge, and makes us a nervous wreck anytime we think someone might be let down.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These kinds of directions steer you farther and farther away from healthy, empowered relationships with others. The more you follow this kind of map, the worse you feel–trapped, powerless, anxious, resentful, in pain. These feelings are usually not the destination we set out for in our love lives, friendships, or business relationships.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s discuss the mindset, beliefs, and map that actually works for relationships. The map that empowers you and others and creates a sense of freedom, autonomy, cooperation, fun, and joy.</p>
