<h4 class="Header-02">It Will Be Messy</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I considered titling this section, “There Will Be Blood” after the epic Daniel Day-Lewis drama about a brutal oil tycoon, but that’s taking it a little too far. When you become more selfish, it can be messy, I promise you that. There will be feelings. People around you might have feelings. They may feel upset, angry, or hurt. You may feel upset, angry, or hurt. Or guilty and bad about yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At this point, you might be thinking: <span class="CharOverride-9">Wow, Aziz. That sounds delightful. Sign me up!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But it’s the only way. The only way out is through. Human relationships are inherently messy. People have all kinds of feelings. These are not signs that we’re doing something wrong. In fact, they may be signs that you’re doing exactly what you need to do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Quite recently I had a messy experience taking care of myself and claiming what I needed. Late last summer my family and I traveled down to Monterey, California, for a week-long vacation. It was the first time we’d flown with two little boys, who were ten-months and two-and-a-half-years-old at the time. Chaos. Packing, food prep, rental cars, non-baby proofed rental house with grandparents, the works. Quite far from your sit-on-the-beach-for-hours-and-watch-the-sunset kind of vacation. But it was beautiful and sweet, too. So many magic moments of being on the beach, playing in parks, going to the aquarium, and time with family. It was an exhausting, full, heart-achingly lovely experience.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Within several days of returning home, we needed to decide our plans for Thanksgiving because it involved purchasing plane tickets. In years past, my family gathered in Los Angeles, California. I enjoyed seeing my cousins, aunts, uncles, and having a chance to spend time with my brother and parents. But doing the entire family plane ride trip again, with all the accommodations, food planning, car renting, and all the rest sounded terrible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I asked myself, “What do I want?” Gasp! This is already becoming quite selfish. You can’t ask that sort of thing about holidays. But ask I did, and I discovered I didn’t want a family trip. Well, part of me did. Moments sounded fun. But a larger part of me wanted to split up the weekend. Spend two days at home with Candace and the boys, then spend two days in Los Angeles with my extended family. Solo.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Using the techniques from the previous chapter, I spoke up for myself and talked about what I wanted. In the moment, Candace agreed quite easily and I purchased the plane ticket. I texted my cousins to get ready for a 2-day binge on <span class="CharOverride-9">Magic: The Gathering.</span>
 I was excited.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, about one week before my trip, Candace became more fully aware of what she agreed to. She felt sad about missing out on time with family, and hurt that I didn’t want to bring everyone along. She also felt upset about me having two days of care-free gallivanting about, <span class="CharOverride-9">Magic</span>
 cards in hand, whilst she pulled a super long two-day solo-parent shift.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">THERE WILL BE BLOOD!! No, but there will be feelings. And my brain and nervous system can react as if something terrible is happening and I need to fix it now, now, now. Candace voiced her upset and was clearly feeling hurt and angry with me. I attempted to empathize with her and not defend my choice or try to talk her out of her feelings. I’d give myself about a “B-” though. Because the moment she expressed her hurt and upset, I was slammed with a wave of guilt and shame. My nice guy programming rushed in hard and fast to tell me what a bad person I was for ditching my poor wife and abandoning my children. Selfish monster!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then it would pull this little number, which you might be familiar with. It started cycling through all the people I know, and what they would think about the situation. Of course, since this fantasy is just a form of my own guilt and self-criticism projected onto others, they all agree that it’s a terrible thing to do. They all shake their heads and cluck their tongues, murmuring amongst each other what a bad husband and father I am.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That wave of guilt and shame made me much less able to be fully present with Candace, tolerate her feelings, and lovingly be with her as she struggled. I tried though, and was sort of able to. Hence the “B-”. In any case, it turned into a fight. Not the yelling and screaming kind of fight, we don’t ever have those. More like a calm but painful discussion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Later that day, as I was paying attention to my feelings and working through them, I remembered the men’s group I used to be a part of. I slowed down and imagined being in the room where we met each Tuesday night for years, retraining ourselves to be more clear, powerful, loving men. I imagined what each of them would say.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As I did so, my nervous system instantly calmed down. The wisdom of that group infused my body as I began hearing the messages I learned from them. I heard things like:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yeah, I hear you. That’s a tough call. I wouldn’t know what to do. I know most of my life I would just not even question it, go as a family, and then be upset and resentful about it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“You are an amazing father and husband. You give so much of yourself. You also have to take care of yourself. Sometimes that is really hard to do.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Whoa, that’s intense. That makes me uncomfortable just to think about it. I wouldn’t do that personally. Good for you, though.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I could also imagine Elliot, the leader of the group, saying something like this: “Of course she has feelings about it. She loves you. She wants to be with you. And you’re not responsible to feel all her feelings for her. You’re responsible for you and your feelings. She’s not a fragile broken creature. She’s a strong and powerful woman, and she can handle it. And... it’s a lot to ask. You may need to make it up to her. Help her do things that support her and help her have more of what she wants.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, I had clarity. I was able to release the guilt and self-attack and fully give myself permission to take care of myself. I no longer needed to defend my decision or my right to choose something that was for me. It was OK. I was OK.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now I could give more spacious and relaxed attention to Candace. I could hear about her feelings of sadness and loneliness, which pre-date our relationship and stem from her childhood. I could hear stories, and see her cry. I could hold her and love her in her sadness, pain, and anger. And so, I did.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The next morning after our fight, I greeted her with a big hug and an apology. I told her how much I loved her and how sweet and beautiful and tender she is. How much I wanted to support her and love her no matter what she’s feeling. These words were combined with a deep, attentive presence that she instantly felt. Of course, I was promptly ambushed by an insane three-year-old dressed head to toe in a dinosaur-covered tracksuit. It wasn’t until later that morning that we could actually have a more in-depth conversation, but by then the energy had shifted and harmony had been restored.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do you notice in yourself as you read this story? Do you feel envious? Upset? Uncomfortable? Does part of you judge me for doing this? Notice your reactions because they will reveal a great deal about your own experience of taking care of yourself. Maybe part of you longs to be freer to take care of yourself and put yourself first sometimes, but the messiness and internal guilt of it make it feel too daunting to try.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If so, here is one thing that may greatly help you on your path. For many years I continually strove to be some sort of superhuman. The kind of person who was always kind, always loving, always generous. Able to give endlessly, be good-natured, always upbeat, never angry or irritable or sad, or anything else “negative.” I demanded that of myself and I attempted to be that way in all my relationships. And guess what? I never made it. I was never able to actually be that perfect person, that saintly figure.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What ended up happening is I would act that way and pretend to be that way, but inside I’d have all kinds of conflicting feelings. I would feel sad, resentful, or burned out. I wouldn’t want to do something, but I’d do it anyway. And when I didn’t feel happy about it, I’d internally beat the crap out of myself for being a “bad, selfish guy.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As far as I can tell, it doesn’t work. It doesn’t transform you into some kind of superhuman. It burns you out and wears you down. It makes you tired, anxious, and depressed. And so, I decided some years back that I was not going to do that to myself any more. I am good in many ways, and even great in some, but I’m definitely not perfect. I’m not completely selfless, completely generous, and completely loving all the time. <span class="CharOverride-10">I stopped trying to be and appear perfect, and started being honest, authentic, and real.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While it was terrifying at first, because I was convinced I had to be perfect in order to be loved, over time nothing bad happened. In fact, I became a lot less resentful, upset, and full of inner turmoil. Aches, pains, and bodily symptoms started to disappear. Relationships went from feeling like a restrictive cage to something that enhanced the quality of my life. In short, it was good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To come full circle and conclude the Thanksgiving saga, I want to share one last piece of that story. I went down to L.A. and hung out with my parents, brother, cousins, and extended family. And guess what? It was OK. To be honest, I missed my wife and boys a ton. My heart ached most of my waking hours for the two days that I was there, and I wished I had brought them. Getting what we want doesn’t always feel amazing, apparently. But asking for it, and claiming it, keeps us sane.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And now I know. Next year I plan to bring the whole gang with me, rental car, child seats, and all. Or maybe we’ll all just stay close to home and keep it simple. All I know is we’ll be together, and it will be awesome.</p>
