<h4 class="Header-02">The Fear Wall</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">We’ve covered many of the internal obstacles to being a more bold, direct, authentic version of yourself. However, there are some specific fears when it comes to speaking up at work that I’ve heard repeatedly from clients. This includes speaking up in meetings, with colleagues, with supervisors, a boss, or someone who is higher up in the company structure.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment to reflect on these kinds of interactions in your own work. What prevents you from speaking with assertiveness and authority in those situations?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here are the most frequent fears:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-10">
<span class="CharOverride-17">·</span>
  Fear of being wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-10">
<span class="CharOverride-17">·</span>
  Fear of being embarrassed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-10">
<span class="CharOverride-17">·</span>
  The assumption that other people’s ideas are better.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-10">
<span class="CharOverride-17">·</span>
  Fear of people seeing you’re nervous.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-10">
<span class="CharOverride-17">·</span>
  Fear of being challenged in front of others and “losing.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">See any you like? Want to take them all home with you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here’s the fundamental truth about fear. <span class="CharOverride-10">Fear unchallenged grows stronger and eventually controls you. Fear faced dissolves as your power grows exponentially.</span>
 As long as these fears dominate your mind and lead to patterns of holding back, staying quiet, and avoiding, you will remain stuck. The only way out is through.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How to shed your limiting negative beliefs and break through fear is an entire book in itself. If you feel held back or paralyzed by fear, and want to be able to habitually activate your DO muscle, so you can consistently take action in the face of fear, I recommend reading my book, <span class="CharOverride-9">The Art of Extraordinary Confidence</span>
 , or exploring my interactive confidence training program, <span class="CharOverride-9">Confidence Unleashed (ConfidenceUnleashedNow.com).</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For now, I’m going to assume that you’re ready, willing, and able to take action on the strategies below. Even if you’re nervous or scared. Even if you need to start small with baby steps. Because in order for you to achieve what you want to achieve in your work and career, and become the person of impact and influence that you want to become, speaking up at work cannot be a one-off, infrequent occurrence. It has to become a habit—something you do all the time. It has to become a part of who you are and how you show up. Then, the doors of opportunity will open up, because you are truly serving others and being the leader you’re meant to be.</p>
