<h4 class="Header-02">The Magic Number 62</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Once I was working with a client named Mira who really didn’t like the idea that some people could dislike her. She intellectually understood that this was inevitable, but she hated it emotionally. She also kept asking, “Yes, but doesn’t how I show up determine whether people like me? If I am charming, or funny, or warm? This will make people like me more, won’t it?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s when I came up with the Magic Number 62.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Imagine you walk into a room that has 100 people in it that you don’t know,” I said during one of our private sessions, “total strangers. Let’s say you had the confidence to approach each person in that room over the course of the day and talk with them. With each person you were able to be relaxed, open, curious, and comfortable. You shared who you were, what you liked, and found out more about them as well. You could also be playful, silly, vulnerable, and everything else you can do when you’re completely at ease. You are just 100% you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“OK…” she said, imagining this scenario.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Out of those 100 people, would every single one like you equally?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No,” she stated quickly, with certainty.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I agree. Some people would love you and really want to spend more time with you. Some would enjoy your company and think you’re pleasant. Some would have a neutral experience and may not even remember the interaction several weeks later. Some would be dissatisfied and not enjoy your presence. And some would feel strong anger and dislike you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Mmm,” she said. It sounded to me like acknowledgment of this likelihood, and a dislike of this fact.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“The question is, out of 100, how many people would have a generally positive feeling towards you?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Uh,” she paused and laughed, considering the slightly odd question. “I don’t know,” she finally said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Sixty-two,” I declared emphatically.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Sixty-two?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That’s right. Sixty-two people would like you after that day,” I said again. There was a long pause as she was trying to figure out just how in the world I came up with this number. “No, I’m just kidding, I have no way of knowing, and neither do you!” She laughed, and we began to discuss this further.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“The number could be forty, or fifty, or sixty-two, or eighty-seven. But it’s highly probable that it will not be one hundred. This is because each person has their own history, perspective, and worldview. Some people will dislike you simply based on your appearance–your physical features, or the clothes you wear. Some people may dislike you because you remind them of their critical mother or their ex. Others might feel intimidated or envious and to deal with feeling inferior they’ll judge and criticize you in their heads to bring you down a notch to their level. Still others are just feeling dissatisfied in their own lives, pissed off at their spouse or boss, and looking for an outlet to release their pent-up frustration.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“The reasons could go on and on, and they’re mostly mysterious and remain unexamined in people. They won’t get curious as to why they have a negative reaction to someone; they won’t look inward. They’ll think that person sucks and that’s that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">“The truth is, we don’t have control of whether people like us or not. The only thing we have control over is how fully we show up.</span>
 How much we put ourselves out there. How boldly and freely we can be ourselves around others in the world. Because I do know one thing for certain. If you lurked in the shadows in that room of one hundred people, and waited for others to approach you, and just smiled and nodded and passively engaged in a few conversations, trying to be nice and be exactly what you think everything else wants, then your number would be a lot lower than sixty-two.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We discussed this for the entire session, and in that time, something really clicked for Mira. She saw the futility of trying to control everyone else’s responses and focused her attention on what she could control–how fully she allowed herself to show up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I know that letting go of this compulsive need to be liked by everyone can be challenging. It can persist despite reason and seem totally irrational, which is all the more reason to use something like the peace process described above. When you notice yourself feeling all twisted up about some negative feedback, or someone not liking you or something you did, stop what you’re doing, slow down, and take a few minutes to find the place in your body that is hurting. Your mind might be spitting out a thousand thoughts per minute, about how they’re wrong, how dare they, and how bad you are, and on and on around the merry go round. Let this keep spinning and drop your attention out of your mind into your body.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice the squeezing in your chest, or the tightness in your throat, or the hollow feeling in the pit of your stomach. Bring your attention right there, to the center of that uncomfortable feeling, and hold it with compassion, patience, and love. Nothing to change, solve, figure out, or fix. Just feeling and breathing. After doing this for several minutes, you might be amazed at how much better you feel, without changing anyone’s opinion of you at all.</p>
