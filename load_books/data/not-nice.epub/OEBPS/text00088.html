<p class="body-paragraph">Please join me in a moment of reverent silence to appreciate the awesomeness of that song, and the era of hair-metal. Thank you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, if you deserve attention, connection, love, and all the rest, what are you waiting for?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s not a rhetorical question, I’m actually wondering what you are waiting for. Usually, we’re waiting for someone to invite us in, give us permission, or tell us it’s OK. We’re waiting for someone to ask us a bunch of questions and draw us out. And we wait, and wait, and wait…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unfortunately, this passive approach doesn’t work and never will. We have to insert ourselves–into conversations, into groups, into people’s lives. The nice-person in you might be cringing a little as I say this. <span class="CharOverride-9">But that sounds so aggressive and pushy, what if they don’t want me there?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Well, then you’ll find that out soon enough. You’ll get a clear signal if your presence, opinion, friendship, or romantic interest is not wanted. And that’s OK. That’s great information so you can move forward to a place where you are wanted and create amazing connections there. Remember, “I’m not for everybody.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you’re at a party, conference, or networking mixer, and there’s all those people standing in little groups of twos, threes, and fours, you must insert yourself. It’s the only way. The alternative is to stand at the edge of the room, thumbing through your phone, pretending like you have such important business to attend to that you couldn’t possibly break away to speak to people. Or you can slide on up to a group and stand on the outskirts, awkwardly waiting, hoping they all stop and turn towards you to warmly invite you in. But how often does that actually happen?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The only effective option is to insert. To walk into the group and stand right there. If someone’s in the middle of speaking you can wait until they’re done. If it sounds like just chit-chat you can come in with a question fitting to the situation: “What brings you here?” “What business are you in?” “What’s your name?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Self-insertion includes starting conversations with people whenever you want to, wherever you want to. At a coffee shop, at the supermarket, on the sidewalk. This can be with a couple standing there, with a kid and his mom, or with a stranger you find compelling and attractive. And it doesn’t just stop there.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We must insert ourselves into people’s lives if we want to connect with them. Once you’ve had that initial conversation, if you want to pursue some sort of relationship, whether it’s for business, a friendship, or a date, you must be willing to reach out numerous times until there is a clear “no” signal. That means repeatedly inviting that person to connect.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re enjoying your connection with someone, initiate further contact by saying something like: “This is great. I like talking with you about this. We should get lunch some time.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, get their number and text them to schedule that lunch. If they’re busy, wait a little bit and reach out again. And again. After three times or so, if you’re getting very little response, you can move on, but most people don’t even make the initial attempt. We don’t want to be rude or pushy. We want to be nice. And so, we wait for <span class="CharOverride-9">them</span>
 to make the first move.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But here’s the thing. Passivity, timidity, and hesitancy don’t compel people to want to spend time with us. Bold, direct, authentic requests and expressions of our interest and appreciation of them do. That’s a different story. That’s what opens people up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">People’s lives are busy. They’re full, and crazy, and hectic, and most people feel a massive scarcity when it comes to time. In fact, as a fun side experiment, ask the next ten people you speak with, “Do you feel like you have enough time?” and see what they say. My guess is 9 out of 10 would say “no.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, we’re all running around, without enough time to get all the urgent stuff done that we think we need to accomplish, and feeling pressured and stressed. So, when someone invites us to do something, what do we think? <span class="CharOverride-9">Aggh, I don’t have the time! Another demand on me!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yet if we had a good connection with that person, where we felt engaged, heard, and liked, part of us wants and needs to do that again. Despite all our frantic business and desire to accomplish, what we all really need most is love and connection. So, do yourself and that person a favor. Reach out again. Reach out in a playful way, a different way, and random way. Leave them a funny voicemail or tease them a bit via text. Remind them of the value of human connection and invite them out again.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do this enough times with enough people and you will have more friends, business connections, clients, and dates than you know what to do with.</p>
