<h4 class="Header-02">Hello Shadow, My Old Friend</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In order to free ourselves of excessive guilt, fear of others’ judgments, and other confining nice person struggles, we must become familiar with our own shadow. We must stop the denial and the pretense that we are just the sweet, not the sour, just the peaceful and never the pissed. When we deny and hide the truth from others, we feel like an imposter, a fraud, and have a deep fear of being discovered for “who we really are.” The more we hide the truth from ourselves, the more guilty, anxious, and even physically injured we become.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As always, the way out is tough. We must turn towards our shadow and welcome it into our awareness. We need to stop forcibly keeping it down in the basement with our ears plugged, eyes closed, and TV blaring to drown out the noise.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There is an old <span class="CharOverride-9">The Simpsons</span>
 Halloween episode where Bart Simpson has a twin brother named Hugo. Hugo is a deformed and monstrous-looking creature, so Homer and Marge decide to keep him hidden in the basement and feed him fish heads. This makes Hugo grow deranged and savage over time. After wacky antics ensue, the episode ends with the Simpsons welcoming Hugo into their dining room where he can eat with them (although they still feed him fish heads).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s what you need to do. No, not the fish head part! That was for entertainment purposes only. The stop keeping your shadow in the basement and welcome him or her to the table part. How do we do this? And, perhaps you’re still wondering, do I really have to? Why would I want to dig around and see all the ways I’m not as good as I thought I was? That sounds uncomfortable, demoralizing, and unproductive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">First off, avoiding your shadow creates a host of problems in your life, ranging from anxiety to depression, to physical pain and injury. This is because it takes a great deal of energy to keep something down and out of awareness. The more we avoid it, the more scared of it we become. We see it as threatening and dangerous—to our relationships, and even to our sense of self (i.e. I’m a “good person” who doesn’t feel angry).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we become more scared of it, our mind needs to create more and more intense distractions to keep us from focusing on our shadow. We can feel anxious about an endless array of things in our lives, ruminate about relationships, or develop panic about something bad happening to our health in the future. We can attack ourselves in our heads, focus on all our flaws, and imagine a dismal future, creating a depression. Or we can wake up each morning with a stiff neck and low back, even though we didn’t do anything strenuous the day before. These are just a few of the thousands of ways that a repressed shadow can manifest in our lives.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, as you’ll see in just a few pages, your shadow is not a bad thing. Actually, befriending it gives you greater self-control and radically increases your self-esteem. It turns out your shadow is your greatest source of power, as it is raw life energy itself. Trust me, it’s worth it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d suggest taking some time away from other people, your phone, your TV, or any other distractions. Get a pen and a journal, or perhaps go for a long walk. As you do, become curious about the parts of yourself that you may have pushed down into the basement long ago. Think about the young child inside of you, your inner three your old, your Id. Remember, this part of you is driven by wanting immediate pleasure, dislikes responsibility, and wants to be taken care of. It hates all the adult responsibilities of relationships, children, work, and other aspects of life. It just wants total freedom and instant gratification. It wants whatever it wants, and it wants it now. And if it can’t have it right away, it gets enraged. It doesn’t really care so much about others, all their needs, being a good parent, or partner, or boss. It doesn’t care about any of that stuff. It wants to play, to have fun, do whatever it wants, and to do it right now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you inquire into this during your journal or walk, give yourself complete permission to allow whatever you discover to just be there. Set aside the Superego’s judgment of how terrible and dangerous this part is. Notice if you clench down, get tense or tight, or otherwise try to shut down your awareness. Making conscious contact with our Id can freak out our Superego, who does not want that little devil pushing you off the righteous path of perfect goodness. But the Id only becomes dangerous if it is left unchecked and takes complete control over someone, which only happens when it’s been pushed out of conscious awareness for too long. Don’t worry, the paradoxical truth is the more aware you become of your shadow, the less power it has to control you. Let yourself see clearly with an attitude of openness and curiosity. Ask your Id questions and listen to its responses. What fascinating creatures we humans are!</p>

<h5 class="Header-03">Rage Ball</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Most people repress feelings of anger. Whether it’s the irritation we feel with our boss, or our child as he pours milk all over the counter, daily life is full of small irritations that we need to suppress our reactions to. In addition, there’s all the demands and pressures of our lives: showing up to work each day, handling projects, dealing with coworkers and customers, being a parent, paying your bills, making healthy food choices, fixing things and solving problems, and on and on. Being a responsible adult in this world involves many demands on your time and energy. This too produces anger. Remember, that Id in there wants fun and pleasure now. She doesn’t want to sit in that two-hour meeting where you have to force yourself to stay awake and look alert as your boss tells another extended story about his past glorious escapades as a salesman for some company that no longer exists.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And these are just the <span class="CharOverride-9">external</span>
 pressures. We also have all the <span class="CharOverride-9">internal</span>
 pressures to contend with as well. The pressures from our Superego to be good, to be nice, to be giving, to be loving, to be generous, to forgive, to put others first, to do a perfect job, to not slack off, to give it our all and do our best all the time on everything, to do better at work, earn more money, spend less and save more, eat better, cook more at home, work out more, get in better shape and look better naked, be funnier, more outgoing, have more friends, not drink so much, not eat sugar, and for heaven’s sake, just be better than you are right now!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do you think all that pressure does to your little Id? Makes him as big as the Hulk. Each of those demands enrages your Id, it’s the complete opposite of everything he wants. And the more pressure we pile on, the more he tantrums inside of us, the more enraged he becomes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even if we aren’t aware of it, this buildup is happening inside. Consciously we put on our best smile and try to push through the day, being a good person. Sure, we may be aware of some annoyance or irritation at a coworker, or someone in traffic, but we handle things well. This is the image of the Superego, the image we want to portray to the world, and to convince ourselves of. But it’s just not true.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you are in physical pain, you’re not “handling everything fine.” If your low back hurts on and off for years, if you have plantar fasciitis and foot and ankle problems, if your neck and shoulders always hurt, if your jaw is tense and you grind your teeth at night, if your old knee acts up, or your stomach is acting funny again... you’re not handling it well. If you feel anxious in the morning, stressed and irritated during the day, and depressed and negative about your life and don’t know why because you have so much and you “should be happy,” then you’re not handling everything fine. If you compulsively check your email, your phone, stats online, social media feeds, the news, anything to absorb your focus, then you’re not handling it fine.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You’re agitated, uncomfortable, and hurting inside, and you need to face it. But don’t worry, it’s not all those dramatic thoughts that you might scare yourself with sometimes. Thoughts like: <span class="CharOverride-9">I must be depressed and have something wrong with my brain; life is just hard and everyone is miserable; I’ll never really be happy again.</span>
 These are all just another form of avoidance, albeit a scarier and absorbing one.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What you need to do is acknowledge your shadow and start paying attention to these feelings. You need to carve out time each day to go for a walk, or to write in a journal. You need to pay attention to your shadow and your Id, and to listen instead of pushing it further down. You need to finally own this part of you, so you can truly feel more alive, happy, and free.</p>
