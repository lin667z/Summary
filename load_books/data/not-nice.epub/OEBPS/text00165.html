<h4 class="Header-02">Halloween</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Our son Zaim is almost three years old. He is very excited about trick-or-treaters coming to our house. He has an entire conversation planned out with these imaginary kids that goes something like this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I say, &quot;How old are you?&quot;</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">They say, &quot;Ten.&quot;</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I say, &quot;Whaaattt???&quot;</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As time passes, no trick-or-treaters arrive. He becomes sad and confused. Where are they? Are they not coming? Apparently not. This is our first Halloween in this house, and apparently our street sucks.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So we grab Zaim, his little baby brother, and the four of us hop into our car to drive to a street nearby that has tons of shops that give out candy to kids. We tell him we&apos;re going to find the trick-or-treaters and he can ask them how old they are. This excites and delights him.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It&apos;s worth mentioning at this point that Candace and I are pretty solid health nuts and eat a super clean diet with no processed foods or sugars. Candy consumption for kids seems inevitable, but our goal is to postpone Zaim&apos;s first highly concentrated chemical sugar-bomb experience until he&apos;s a bit older.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So there we are on Alberta Street in Portland, watching as kids and adults in costumes pass every which way. Zaim is enthralled and stares wide-eyed as ghosts, ninjas, a yeti, and Batman walk by. He begins carrying out his mission of asking other kids how old they are until he finds a ten-year-old.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The rain has stopped for the evening and the cool dusk air is rich with the smell of moisture, leaves, and fall. Our son is adorable as he slightly awkwardly approaches kids bombarding them with &quot;how old are you?&quot; as they attempted to walk past. It’s a sweet, tender moment and life is good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then Iron Man shows up. A little boy in costume walks by us next to his mother. In response to Zaim&apos;s standard question, the little boy stops, turns and says he’s four. Then his mother, who notices that Zaim has no bucket of candy and her son has a full bucket of candy says, &quot;Honey, let&apos;s give him some candy.&quot;</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Uh oh. We weren&apos;t prepared for this moment. &quot;No, that&apos;s OK,&quot; I reply with a smile. It’s fairly obvious that little Iron Man was in agreement with me on this point. His long pause conveyed his thoughts: <span class="CharOverride-9">Yeah, what that guy said. No to giving out candy.</span>
 But his mom took my &quot;no thanks&quot; as some form of politeness and insisted. &quot;Derek, give him a piece of candy. Just one.&quot;</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In that moment, nice guy programming took over and I stood silently as Iron Man picked out a cherry lollipop to give to Zaim. We thanked them as they walked off. Zaim promptly unwrapped the sweet treat and marveled at the bright red color.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It was 6:20 pm, just 40 minutes before bedtime. The most sub-optimal time to introduce a sugar smash. So we had him smell it, which turned into rubbing it on his lips, which turned into &quot;I want to eat this so bad it hurts.&quot; But we didn&apos;t let him. And he cried. And I held him as he asked me why he couldn&apos;t eat it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It was humorously, heart wrenchingly tragic. Now, regardless of whether you agree with my stance on candy for almost-three-year-olds, this whole experience could have been avoided.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What stopped me from more firmly refusing the candy? Being too nice. Because in my mind, if I said in a clear and friendly tone, &quot;No thanks, we&apos;re OK. We don&apos;t eat candy,&quot; then this woman would feel judged for letting her kid eat candy. I didn’t want her to feel bad, or to judge me for being weird or uppity. So I said nothing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Forget that. In my fantasy re-do, I simply tell her that we don&apos;t want it. If she has feelings about it, that&apos;s OK. It&apos;s quite likely she might not even think twice about it if we’d refused. I&apos;ll never know. But I do know that in the future I will be clearer about saying no, even if it&apos;s a little uncomfortable.</p>
