 g Dread</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If no is so great, how come we don’t use it all the time, whenever we want? In fact, I may be preaching to the choir. You may already know that it’s good to say no and have been wanting to do so more. And yet, something stops you. What is it? The only thing that ever really stops any of us: fear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At its core, the main obstacle is simply fear of what will happen if we say no. We have dozens of predictions about what might happen and how people could react. They will be upset, turned off, angry, frustrated, hurt, disappointed, and unhappy. This will lead to breakups, firing, loss of clients and customers, and death and ruin.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Fun side note: After studying fear so much these last fifteen years, I was fascinated by how if you follow the fear down to its root, it leads you to intense isolation, pain, death, and loss of everything we love, hence the phrase death and ruin. To snap myself out of worry and fear-based thinking, I will often playfully call out, “DEATH AND RUIN!” in my mind. For example, if my mind starts worrying, “did I do that intervention right? That client is probably disappointed and upset with me–DEATH AND RUIN!” This always makes me smile and helps me keep perspective. Use that as you will, or don’t. And now back to our regularly scheduled programming…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We are scared of saying no. We think bad things will happen. In fact, we even accumulate evidence of bad things happening after we did say no at different times in our lives. People <span class="CharOverride-9">did</span>
 get upset. We <span class="CharOverride-9">did</span>
 get in trouble at work. It <span class="CharOverride-9">was</span>
 bad, see? This selective evidence gathering keeps the anti-no propaganda campaign going, so we never use the word.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While bad and undesirable outcomes might happen, this is actually very unlikely because for significant loss to occur, such as the loss of a job or relationship, many things have to be going wrong. If you are an amazing team member and continually produce outstanding results, and then you say no to some things you don’t want to do, no one is going to fire you. If you are a loving spouse who is deeply connected with your partner, they’re not going to leave you if so say no to some invitations. So, these outcomes are actually very unlikely.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What we’re really scared of is the emotional discomfort around saying no. We’re afraid of that tension that can occur when our desires differ from someone else’s, that feeling of discomfort and unease in your chest and stomach when someone is upset with us. Why is this so emotionally upsetting, even if rationally we know that it’s OK to say no and speak up for what we want?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are your biggest fears about saying no? Take a moment to think about that now. The more specific you can be, the freer you will become.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here are the most common fears about saying no:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-10">

 Fear of our own judgment of being a bad, selfish person</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While all of these contribute to the fear we feel about saying no, there is one that is underneath them all. It feeds many of them and is responsible for the strongest resistance and avoidance. At its root, the fear of saying no comes from insecure attachment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Remember way back when in Chapter 2 we talked about relationships sometimes feeling like walking on a tightrope? If we are securely attached, we know that we can be ourselves, make mistakes, and generally live our lives and people close to us will love us for who we are. They aren’t going anywhere. When we are insecurely attached, we can feel like we have to earn love and continually keep people close to us by not making mistakes, never upsetting, and otherwise being “good.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In short, saying no makes us feel unsafe. It can trigger a fear of being abandoned in emotional centers in our brain. When people are sad, disappointed, or angry, they tend to be less warm and available. This withdrawal can trigger that insecure feeling, which is uncomfortable. Most people will react to this feeling by trying to hastily apologize. Have you ever had that urge after saying no or being assertive? Lord knows I have.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But insight leads to liberation, if it’s coupled with action. When you step up and take the risk to say no, it might not be pretty, and it might not be comfortable. After you do it, your stomach may lurch and your brain may kick into hyper-worry mode. If you know, however, that your discomfort, no matter how intense, is due to an internal fear that long predates your current situation, you are much better equipped to deal with it. Instead of going outward to fix the situation, you’ll turn inward to feel. You can soothe that frightened part and see how to calm yourself so you feel safer and grounded in your body. Doing so is the pathway to freely and easily say no without guilt, and is what you’re going to learn later in this chapter. First, let’s explore what most people do with the creeping dread–avoid it.</p>
