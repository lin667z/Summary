<h4 class="Header-02">Certainty Trumps All</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">“When two people meet, the person in a greater state of certainty will always influence the other one. Assuming, of course, they are in rapport.”</span>

<span class="CharOverride-9">“But I have a no conflict of interest provision as president...I could actually run my business and run government at the same time. I don’t like the way that looks, but I would be able to do that if I wanted to. I would be the only one to be able to do that.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">- Donald Trump</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Certainty is extremely influential. It was one of the factors that helped Donald Trump become President of the United States. Regardless of your political perspective, his ability to stand behind what he said with complete and utter certainty was convincing. It compelled many people, and provided a sense of clarity and certainty in a world that is uncertain and increasingly complex.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While you might not want to take it as far as The Donald, most likely you could benefit from more certainty in your communication. This is because you might have a history of holding back, hesitating, or doubting your perspective or your value. When we do first start speaking up, this old doubt can negatively affect your ability to influence and impact others. It makes you sound uncertain, unsure of yourself, and decreases the perceived value of what you are saying, even if what you are saying is intelligent and valuable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There are two main ways uncertainty shows in communication that you will want to watch out for: Hesitant Tone and Qualifiers.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Hesitant Tone</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This happens when we speak from a stance of doubt or insecurity, when we’re more focused on whether people will like what we’re saying, and if we’re good enough. This happens when we’re singing the “me, me, me!” song in our heads instead of focusing on our point and the impact we’d like to make.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A hesitant tone is usually soft and quiet. It is filled with pauses, taking too long to choose the right words, and filler sounds, such as “um,” or “ah.” This kind of hesitant tone loses your audience faster than flipping them off would (at least that would have some provocative energy to it!).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It is usually accompanied by shallow breathing. Our heads are usually not fully upright and our eye contact is typically inconsistent. Remember the submissive stance from earlier in this book? Same thing here. We’re standing up to share, but we’re doing so in a timid, submissive way, which, unfortunately, does not influence others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’ve seen this subtle pattern cause surprisingly significant consequences in many of my clients’ lives. One client was a highly skilled surgeon who was known for his top-quality performance and warm bedside manner. In spite of this, he failed his board certification oral exams twice—not because of a lack of knowledge or skill, but simply because he did not sound confident when he delivered his answers. Many other clients struggle to be taken seriously by family and friends, feel others don’t perceive them with respect, or are often overlooked as dating and relationship partners, all due to this one habit.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Qualifiers</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Qualifiers are phrases we use before or after we speak up that are designed to soften what we say. When we’re insecure we can begin or end our statement with qualifiers that are apologetic and submissive. They are designed to diminish what we say, so as to not produce conflict, disagreement, or anything else we perceive as threatening.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Some examples are:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m sorry to put this out there, but… (statement)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You’ll probably think this is wrong… (statement)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I have an idea. It might not work, but… (statement)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m sorry, but can I add something?... (statement)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">(statement)... I don’t know.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">(statement)... but that’s just my opinion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">(statement)... but I don’t know as much about this as you do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Have you used any of these? Do you have other ones that are your go-tos? Pay attention the next time you’re in a social group or business setting. Notice what qualifiers others use, and which ones you tend to use.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, eliminate them.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Certainty Rant</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If you want to be a person who is taken seriously and seen as a leader both in business and socially, you must learn how to communicate with a tone of certainty. The good news is it’s not that hard. You don’t have to become smarter, gain twenty years of experience, or achieve anything else first. You can just start doing it now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Speaking with certainty is just a pattern of voice tone and body language. First, start paying attention to when you are certain about something. I had a client who was hesitant when speaking socially, especially with people he didn’t know very well. He was a successful business owner, who knew quite a bit about business building, but even talking about this was difficult. He was concerned about saying something with certainty because he feared someone could find a counterargument and disagree with him. Or he could see that there’s always another perspective and he wanted to acknowledge and honor that every time he spoke. The result was a halting, hesitant sounding manner of speech that was filled with the qualifier, “I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To begin, I asked him some questions about a topic he was completely certain about: football. I asked him a series of basic questions about which teams were favorites this season and why. I asked him what their weaknesses were and who the best quarterback in the league was. No matter what my question, he answered immediately, with a tone of absolute certainty.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Next, we had him study other people in his life who spoke with certainty. He noticed their body language and voice patterns. He began paying a little less attention to <span class="CharOverride-9">what</span>
 they were saying, and started paying more attention to <span class="CharOverride-9">how</span>
 they were speaking.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I encourage you to do the same thing. Discover in your own life what you are certain about and notice how you communicate when speaking about it. Where are you naturally most certain? Is it in your knowledge about sports, movies, or video games? Perhaps it’s your opinions in politics, finances, or another field.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve identified it, do the following exercise. The next time you’re alone, perhaps driving somewhere in your car, go on a “certainty rant.” This is where you speak out loud, with complete and total conviction about anything you want. Start out with the topic you know well. It doesn’t matter what the content, or how eloquent or thought out it is. That’s not the point. The point is to begin practicing speaking with authority. Think of it as vocal training for an actor.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’re going, start talking about anything and everything in your life. What you did yesterday, what you’re going to do that day, a particular situation at work, your opinion on an issue in your team, what you think of someone’s performance, what you liked about the dinner party last night (or didn’t like). Don’t censor yourself. This is not a time to be nice or polite. No one’s going to hear this, it’s just an exercise to flex your certainty muscle.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice what happens as you do this. Where do you sound most certain? Where do you falter or become hesitant? As you practice these once per day in your car, do you slowly become more and more certain sounding in the areas where you once sounded unsure of yourself?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are the qualities of a certain voice tone? What is your volume like? How quickly do you speak? What is your tone like? It’s slightly different for everyone, so you want to discover this for yourself. And the only way to do this is to get into action and start practicing. Once you do, you just might find that the certainty rant is actually fun and generates a confidence in yourself that lasts for hours afterward as you go about your day.</p>
