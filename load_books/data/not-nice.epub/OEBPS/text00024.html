<span class="CharOverride-9">“If you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">- 900 million parents worldwide.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This second guideline seems to make sense, right? Don’t do anything to hurt others’ feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Who could possibly argue with that rule? It seems like something any kind, loving, good person would live by, right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Well... Maybe. And maybe not. What if someone wants to talk with you and you don’t want to talk with them? What if someone is prattling on with their eighth story about their car engine upgrade and you aren’t in the least bit interested? What if someone asks you to go out with you and you don’t want to? What if a person you’re dating really likes you and wants to become your girlfriend or boyfriend, but you’re not excited about it? What if someone bothers, annoys, irritates, or pisses you off?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You stuff these impulses way down into your belly of course! You stop being so selfish and force yourself to be patient, to be flexible, to just go with the flow, and “be nice.” So, you talk to that person. Or, better yet, you actively engage them and pretend to be really excited to see them. “Hey Arthur! How’s it going?!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You endure conversations that don’t interest you; you do things you don’t really want to do; and you end up dating someone weeks, months, or years longer than you should. Yes, years. I’ve talked with clients who have been wanting to end their relationships for a long time, and the only thing that’s keeping them there is guilt. “But my partner will be crushed!” Guilt, and maybe a dash of fear. “If I leave, I’ll never find anyone else. I’m scared of being alone.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Furthermore, what about annoyance, irritation, and anger? Those aren’t nice, are they? Stuff those down in your belly too. And smile. Don’t forget to smile.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ugh. What makes us do this? Why are we so disconnected from ourselves? Why are we so afraid to be ourselves? The answer, my friend, is guilt. Good, old-fashioned, guilt.</p>
