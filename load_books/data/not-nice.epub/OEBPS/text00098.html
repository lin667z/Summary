<h4 class="Header-02">Dealing With “Superiors”</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Superior is defined by Google Dictionary as “being higher in rank, status, or quality.” While this definition includes three very different things, our subconscious minds can blur them together. Hence, we consciously know that our superiors in business just have a higher rank or status than us, but we <span class="CharOverride-9">subconsciously</span>
 think they have a higher <span class="CharOverride-9">quality</span>
 than us. Higher quality equals “better than me.” Just like when people hear the term “net worth,” it&apos;s hard not to subconsciously equate that with your worth as a human.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As a result, we often approach people who are of a superior standing in the company as if we are inferior human beings. This can amplify any pre-existing habits of approval seeking, people pleasing, or hesitation to anxiety-producing levels. This generates fear, worry about meetings and presentations, and more hesitation and avoidance, none of which is you owning your power and freely being who you want to be in the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s important to realize that company status or position does not equal smarter, more talented, or better. There are many reasons someone achieves a high rank in a company. They could have been there earlier, or in the right place at the right time. They could be good at talking, connecting, and schmoozing. They could be good at sounding certain even when they’re unsure of what they’re talking about. They don’t necessarily know more or have some secret quality that makes them better.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The key to being less nice around your boss, senior management, and anyone else is to see through the company strata and look right at the person in front of you. The human being. The soft, fleshy pile of bones, organs, and skin. The one who has hopes, dreams, and fears, just like you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To help you do just this, let me share a little story about the “Executive Committee.”</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">The “Executive Committee”</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The key to boldly speaking up around anyone at work is to remember this key insight: Everyone you work with, no matter how high up in the company, how successful, how experienced, or how rich, is still just some person. Some dude. Some gal.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">They sleep in a bed, poop in the morning, and sometimes get terrible gas that they try to hide from others. They sometimes feel happy, excited, confident, and totally on fire. And sometimes they feel confused, uncertain, insecure, or inferior (even if you&apos;ve never seen them act that way). They have challenges in their relationships and sometimes struggle with their spouse or kids. They will get old, they will get sick, they will feel afraid at times, and eventually they will die. They are just a human animal moving through this mysterious life, trying to figure it all out and have some purpose and happiness before it&apos;s all over.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The more you see through the suits, the jargon, and the “I got it all together” facade, the more relaxed and confident you will become.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, one client I was speaking with was anxious about an upcoming meeting she had with the executive committee in her company. She was preparing for the meeting and feeling tense, worried, and unsure of herself, despite decades of experience at the company.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I noticed every time she referred to the meeting and the people there, she called them “the executive committee.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“How many people are on this executive committee?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Two,” she replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Two!” I exclaimed, “I was imagining a boardroom full of nine stone-faced, old guys in suits.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No,” she laughed. “It&apos;s just two. And I actually know them both well.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What are their names?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Tim and Glenn,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Tim and Glenn,” I repeated. “That&apos;s a lot less intimidating sounding. What&apos;s Tim like?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I asked her more questions about the people she was meeting with until they once again became people in her mind. She has a long history with them both and could see that they cared about her and they had great working relationships.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, the next time you&apos;re going to meet with your “supervisor” or “the CEO,” what if you started thinking about your meeting with Sunil or Linda? Because that&apos;s all that it is.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Serving Versus Pleasing</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Have you ever been on the opposite side of the pleasing dynamic? Perhaps you meet someone socially or at work, and you can instantly tell they like you and are impressed by you. They want you to like them. They are engaged, energetic, and… a little too much. They laugh too hard at what you say, they agree too quickly, and they smile too much even when the topic is serious. How does this feel when it’s happening?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In my experience, it’s unpleasant. While there is an appreciation or admiration present, there is also a lack of authenticity. It’s hard to really trust that person because they’re not showing who they really are. And there is the palpable sense that they want something from me. They need something from me (specifically my approval).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is not the kind of impression you want to make on senior management, or your boss, or anyone else for that matter. Your boss doesn’t want you to please her. She wants you to add something of value that benefits her, the customers, and the company. The executive team doesn’t want you to agree with everything and smile. They want you to boldly share your expertise to help them make the best decisions possible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The difference between serving and pleasing comes down to what we are focusing on. When we are pleasing, we are focused on ourselves. Sure, we’re paying attention to the other person and the situation, but all so we can get a gauge on our performance and how others are liking it. <span class="CharOverride-9">Do they like me? Is this going well?</span>
 We then say and do whatever we need to so that they are pleased with us. This leads to over-agreement, not pointing out challenges, and often taking on too much so that we end up over-promising and under-delivering.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, we want to serve. Serve your boss, serve the company, serve your customers and clients. Service is one of my core values and the more I live it, the better I feel, and the more abundant my life and business becomes. When we serve someone we ask questions, share our input, and try to do whatever’s best to help the situation. We’re focused on the other person and their needs, and the larger situation as a whole. We can disagree if we think that serves the person. We say what needs to be said, even if it’s uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And when you do this, guess what happens? People respect you. Your boss admires you and trusts you. The executive team appreciates your honesty and imagines you will be a powerful member of their team one day. And your clients and customers benefit greatly and want more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you are reading about speaking up at work and in your social life, you may be feeling more and more liberated and excited. It might seem possible for you to bring more of yourself to the table so that you can be more expressive and free. You can be out on the field and a major player, stepping into the life you actually want for yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And you may have a part of you that is cranking up a little nervous energy and worry: <span class="CharOverride-9">Yes, but what if I say that and someone doesn’t like it? What if they challenge me publicly? What if someone shuts me down or mocks me? What if they get angry and criticize me? What if all my goals and dreams go terribly wrong??</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These kinds of fears are a sign that you need to have a road map to handle objections, disagreements, and other difficult conversations.</p>
