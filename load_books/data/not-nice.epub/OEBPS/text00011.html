<h4 class="Header-02">There’s Something Wrong With Me</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">With all my online studies and practice, I learned to walk taller, look people in the eye, and approach others instead of avoiding them. I learned how to engage with women, flirt, create sexual tension and openly express my desire. I learned how to be more bold and confident... for a little while.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Soon I discovered that I could make a good first impression. I could appear fully confident. And maybe even go on several dates and sleep with a woman. I could speak my mind with friends and acquaintances. I could share my ideas in groups. But after doing these sorts of things, my nice guy impulses would come back with a vengeance. It was almost like I learned how to suppress it temporarily, but it had simply retreated to the shadows, waiting for its opportunity to pounce.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d be more bold and speak up, but then the next day I would replay the interaction and second guess myself. Or worse, just tear myself to shreds. <span class="CharOverride-9">Why did you say all that? You talked way, way too much! You seemed so over-excitable and lame. Pathetic.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or I’d boldly initiate a conversation and be the smoothest, most charming guy you could imagine. We’d go on a date or two, and it would go incredibly well. But then my anxiety would surge back. Especially after we’d have sex for the first time. I would instantly feel responsible for all of her feelings. I would start scanning for all the ways I could reassure her and give her the impression that I loved her, that I was the man of her dreams, that I never liked any other woman as much as I liked her, and that all I wanted to do was spend all day, every day with her.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This may sound like a caring, considerate, and ideal way to enter into a relationship. In fact, with my wife, Candace, I frequently tell her how much she means to me, how grateful I am she’s with me, and seek to reassure her when she’s feeling insecure. That is just one of the many beautiful gifts of love.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But this was different. This was niceness to the max. Because I <span class="CharOverride-9">didn’t</span>
 really love these women yet. In fact, we didn’t even know each other yet, and we weren’t the right match. I was so skin-crawlingly uncomfortable with her experiencing any negative emotion, that I played a role. I took complete responsibility for every single one of her feelings, and I was held hostage by my own fear of guilt and self-loathing should she feel bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sound extreme? It was! It also was very painful. This nice guy compulsion prevented me from saying no. Instead I pretended to have certain feelings, and avoided difficult conversations.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What if I was dating other people and wasn’t sure yet who I wanted to be in a relationship with? And what if (gasp), it was not with her?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">I could never say that!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What if I wanted to do my own thing on a Saturday night and I didn’t feel like hanging out?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">What?! How could I be so heartless!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And so, with all this fear and pretending and avoiding, my romantic relationships didn’t last. I could only sustain this charade for a few weeks or months. At that point, I could no longer confine myself and I would hastily end the relationship, which was often a surprise to her because until then I was the best guy in the world and “everything was perfect.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A few times I tried to “white knuckle it” and push through my anxiety to stay in a relationship longer. I tried this with a sweet, intelligent, and beautiful woman from San Francisco. She was amazing and we got along so well that I told myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">This is it! No more fleeing!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I met her at a Whole Foods supermarket in the Bay Area. All my years of practicing bold action paid off, as I was able to simply walk up to her and start a conversation in the bulk foods aisle. She had sandy blond hair, a beautiful smile, and piercing blue eyes that were fully alive with energy and enthusiasm for life. We instantly connected about health and nutrition. I was infatuated.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Our first dates were fun, interesting, and exciting. We were both life-long learners and had studied different areas, so we were sharing back and forth like crazy. She was incredibly sexy and I was instantly drawn in. And then the pattern started all over again…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It really began in earnest after the first time we made love. That experience, like many of the times I first made love with a new partner, was awkward. At that time, I didn’t have the confidence to talk about sex before, during, or after. I was too nice. I didn’t want to make anyone uncomfortable, or say anything that might hurt or upset my partners.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I remember sitting at my kitchen table the next morning, eating breakfast, and feeling so uncomfortable. I wanted to say something, to talk about our experience. It wasn’t terrible, but it just felt off. I didn’t feel connected to her during sex and I had all kinds of questions about her experience. But she seemed relaxed and fine, so I thought: <span class="CharOverride-9">This is all in my head. I’m too insecure. If I reveal anything she’ll feel bad and I’ll look like a loser.</span>
 So, I finished my oats, walked her to her car, and said nothing more of it. In fact, we never talked about sex in our entire time together. Not once.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sure enough, at the two month mark I started to feel the urge to flee. I had anxiety before I’d go to her house and urges to hastily break up. I knew the pattern well, and this time I’d resolved to not act on it. I was going to push through, dammit!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But four months into our relationship, I started having panic attacks when I spent time with her. I remember one sunny summer day at a beautiful park in the city, relaxing on a blanket in a grassy field, catching some sun together. From the outside, this scenario seems perfect, but inside I was tense, uncomfortable, and down. I hid all this from her, of course, and put on my best happy face.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I needed to use the bathroom so I walked across the park and over a little hill to find one. Upon getting there, I was flushed with one of the most intense feelings of fear I’ve ever had. I got dizzy and had difficulty breathing. I felt an overwhelming sense of dread. My mind was racing with frenzied and incomplete thoughts: <span class="CharOverride-9">I can’t go back there. I just can’t. I have to get out. I have to get away!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I tried to breathe and calm myself down, to slow my thoughts, but it was no use. My mind was throwing images at me of literally running out of the park, getting back into my car, and driving away, leaving her in the park on that blanket, lying in the sun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A few times I tried to start walking back towards her, and the dread became so intense, I turned back towards the bathroom. I paced back and forth in front of the bathroom for what felt like an eternity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The experience was eerily similar to when I was a small child and had just woken up from sleepwalking. I would often awaken in a state of panic and fear in some random room in our house. I would be too scared to go back into my bedroom, and have an urge to go to my parents’ room. But I was too terrified to do that as well. So, I would pace back and forth between the two, feeling increasing dread, as I got closer to each one.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After pacing and panicking for a good long while, I began to regain my composure. I looked up at the tops of the dark green pine trees against the bright blue sky. Focusing on nature helped. “OK. OK.” I said to myself. “I’m OK.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I pulled myself together and began walking back to our blanket. I was probably gone for fifteen or twenty minutes—a slightly unusual amount of time to go pee. When I returned she was just lying there in the sun. The silky white skin of her stomach lay exposed and her arms flopped lazily over her head.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hey,” she said as she squinted up at me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hey,” I replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">She didn’t seem to notice that I’d been gone too long. Or that I looked a little disheveled. She was lost in reverie on a beautiful, sunny summer day. I kept my fear, doubts, and utter insanity to myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As this pattern of getting close and then fleeing continued, relationship after relationship, I began to develop a terrible belief about myself. I kept asking myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">Why can’t I have a relationship? Why do I freak out?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then my mind came up with an answer, as it always does when you ask it a question. Unfortunately, if you ask a bad question, you get a bad answer. The answer to my question was this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Because there’s something wrong with me. I’m not capable of close connection, an intimate relationship. There’s something fundamentally flawed or broken inside of me. That’s why.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Uplifting, huh?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And it wasn’t just in romantic relationships. Deep down I felt like whatever was wrong with me also made me undesirable to others and unworthy of love, success, and happiness.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I didn’t walk around thinking everyone hated me. I had developed my outer confidence enough to talk with people, make friends, and pursue a career. But there was an underlying feeling of anxiety behind all this outward action. Deep inside I had a nagging feeling that friends would get upset and maybe leave, successful people wouldn’t want to take the time to talk with me or help me in my career, and that I was somehow not safe and not loved.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And guess what? I wasn’t.</p>
