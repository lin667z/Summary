<h4 class="Header-02">The Resentment Formula</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">After working with thousands of people, it’s become clear to me that there is a natural formula for resentment in humans, and it goes something like this.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">&amp;#9;</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Giving + No Choice About the Matter = Resentment</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If we give too much, <span class="CharOverride-9">and feel like we do not have a choice about the giving</span>
 , we will feel resentment (which is just another word for anger). The not having a choice part seems to be the key factor in the resentment formula.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We can give generously and freely, and do so way more than we receive in relationships. In fact, that can be an extremely healthy thing to do and is a key component of creating extraordinary romantic relationships and deeply bonded relationships with our children: to give more than we receive. But, if that giving is done under pressure or demand, we will start to feel angry.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Often times the pressure is not obvious or overt. It’s not always the boss yelling at you to “get that report done by Sunday night dammit!” <span class="CharOverride-10">The pressures are often internal and based on your own need to please others and be nice.</span>
 More specifically, the pressure comes from that convincing voice in your held that commands you to carry out your nice-person conditioning. <span class="CharOverride-9">She wants that, so I’ll do it. I know he likes that and I don’t want to disappoint him. They’ll be hurt if I say no, so I’d better say yes and go.</span>
 All of these pressures to be nice and “do the right thing” eliminate a sense of autonomy, freedom, and choice. You’ve given up your sovereignty. You <span class="CharOverride-9">have to</span>
 do these things. And this is what creates the resentment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If your nice-person programming is particularly strong, then you may not even realize you’re angry. That is not nice, after all, and therefore remains blocked from your conscious awareness. But regardless of your awareness of it, it’s there. Because it’s part of human nature. We resist pressure, demand, and bondage. Even if we’re outwardly compliant, our shadow does not go silently into that good night. It gets fired up, pissed off, and ready to fight.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you own your shadow and speak up for yourself, then you can speak about this challenge directly and work through it quickly in your relationships. If you do not, then it will manifest as passive aggressive behaviors, distancing or withdrawing from the other person, secretly judging them, being internally irritable or blaming them, or annoyed by minor things such as how they breathe through their nose or certain faces they make.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If anger is completely taboo for you, then even these signs of irritation will be blocked out of your awareness by more powerful defenses, such as feeling anxious or depressed, having panic attacks, developing chronic pain conditions such as back or neck pain, repetitive stress injuries, or a “frozen shoulder” (from sitting at a computer too much no doubt. <span class="CharOverride-9">This has nothing to do with my feelings. Nothing I say! It’s all structural, my doctor told me so).</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Whether you’re aware of the source of your resentment or not, you will suffer the consequences. It sucks away your happiness, peace, and joy in life and leaves you feeling angry and burnt-out, or sad, anxious, depleted, and depressed. When you’re struggling in this way, you might turn to others for help: friends, family, parents, or those in our community. This may alleviate feelings of loneliness and isolation and give you some sense of connection. However, most people in your world may have no idea about the resentment formula. They may perceive putting others first as one of your best virtues and encourage you to “stick with it” and “have faith.” In other words: keep on going as you always have, try harder, be nicer, and it will all work itself out. But what if it doesn’t?</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Give and Give</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">“I know I’m going to break up with her,” he said with certainty. “It’s not a question of ‘if,’ it’s a question of ‘when.’”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was surprised by his clarity. Many clients I’ve worked with are often in a more ambivalent, tortured state about whether to end their romantic relationship.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was walking in my favorite park near my office, having a phone session with a highly motivated, insightful man named Jason. He was in his late thirties and he had been with his partner for six years.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“You sound clear in yourself about what you want to do,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yeah,” he agreed in a pained voice. “I’m not looking forward to it. It’s going to break her heart. When I’ve hinted about any change in our relationship in the past, it did not go well at all.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I asked him about this and he told me about his partner becoming extremely distraught, crying, and saying, “How could you <span class="CharOverride-9">do</span>
 this to me? How could you value us so little?” and other blaming statements.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And so, he stayed with her. He knew he wanted to move on, to experience life outside of the relationship, to follow his heart. There was no doubt about that. He just didn’t want to hurt her. He loved her deeply and he cared about her. He didn’t want her to feel so much pain.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">He decided to wait for the right time. She was going through some job challenges and was currently unemployed. She also had lost some of her friends recently and he was her main source of social connection. <span class="CharOverride-9">I’ll wait until she’s got a job and a few friendships</span>
 , he thought to himself, <span class="CharOverride-9">then she’ll be able to handle the end of our relationship</span>
 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As the months passed and she continued to struggle to find work, she eventually cast a wider net for job opportunities. Soon she received an offer from a company in another state. He decided to move with her, since he ran his own business from home and could work from anywhere. <span class="CharOverride-9">She’ll get set up in this job, make some friends, get settled into the new city, and be in a much better place. Then we can break up.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But then the holidays were coming up, and he didn’t want to do that to her right before the holidays. Then she didn’t like her new job all that much and was dissatisfied. And now he was having a conversation with me about it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Jason was an extremely loving and caring person. I could feel how much he wanted what was best for his partner, and how much it pained him when she hurt. I could see how responsible he felt for her feelings and how much guilt he experienced. I could also see how unfulfilled he was in his life, and how much of himself he’d shut down and hidden in order to make his relationship work. And just how much his partner’s needs, wants, and feelings mattered more than his own.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is the plight of the nice-person: to prioritize others, be a good person and do the right thing, only to feel restricted, hollow, angry, and depressed inside, and then to respond to that pain by giving and prioritizing others even more, attempting to dig our way out of a hole by digging further.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may read Jason’s story and see it as extreme. Or you may be shaking your head in amazed recognition at how eerily similar his story sounds to yours. In either case, we’re all doing the same thing to some degree. We’re all giving too much and perceiving ourselves as not having a choice in the matter, whether it’s with our spouse, kids, a boyfriend or girlfriend, with co-workers, employees, clients, or a boss. We all feel like there’s certain things we just <span class="CharOverride-9">have to</span>
 do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That is, until we decide to change our priorities. To change how we approach relationships and other people. To let go of over-responsibility, unhelpful childhood programming, and negative ideas about taking care of ourselves, and step up and take responsibility for ourselves, our lives, and our happiness. To upgrade our understanding of relationships to see what actually leads to lasting love and connection with others, rather than staying stuck in inner commandments about how we “should be.” Until we decide to become more selfish.</p>
