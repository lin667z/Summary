<h4 class="Header-02">Man, I’m Too Nice…</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">My dad and I finished our meal at a delicious Mexican restaurant called La Bonita in Portland. He was visiting for a few days and we decided to get some lunch together so we could catch up, since having extended conversations around the dinner table with two toddlers is a virtual impossibility. Winter was ending and it was the first warm, dry day in weeks. I had a fantastic time with my dad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we were getting up to leave, I brought our dishes over to the self-bussing area (it’s a Portland thing). He went to go use the bathroom. Right outside the bathroom door, there was a young woman who was hunched over, fiddling with a key. The door was wide open and she was apparently trying to get the key out of the lock.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Are you using the bathroom?” my dad asked as he approached her.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m just trying to figure out how to get this key out,” she replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Just as she said that, she apparently succeeded, as the small key attached to an oversized serving spoon came loose. At the same moment she was doing that, my dad walked into the bathroom and closed the door, assuming she was on her way out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It all happened very quickly, and I wasn’t too focused on the matter. But then I heard someone sitting nearby, who had witnessed the entire exchange, call out to the young woman, “There’s another bathroom in the back!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To which she replied, “Thanks. Man, I’m too nice.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Apparently, she had just struggled with the key and held the door wide open for my dad to use the bathroom. Instead of telling him when he asked, “Yes, I’m about to use this bathroom,” she gave a vague response instead. Too nice indeed...</p>
