</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once again, the pain of confinement and anxiety built up inside me. While I had more friends, more dating experiences, and more direction in my career, I was still trapped in a shell of niceness and fear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I wasn’t deeply enjoying all the successes I had, and I felt further away from a deep, lasting romantic relationship than ever before. When I was fully honest with myself, I realized I was still scared of people most of the time. Still scared of offending them, worried if they liked me, and not completely comfortable with myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d learned how to <span class="CharOverride-9">appear</span>
 more self-assured and confident, but not be more self-assured and confident. This became glaringly obvious after yet another failed relationship in which I became over-accommodating, absorbed tons of criticism, and stayed way too long. It was time for action.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And this time, my choice was clear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am going to shatter this nice guy shell. I’m going to be honest and direct. <span class="CharOverride-10">I’m going to face whatever discomfort I need to face, learn whatever it is I need to learn, do whatever it takes to feel more confident, powerful, and capable.</span>
 To enjoy a deep, fulfilling relationship with the love of my life. To be the powerful man I’m meant to be in this world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once we make a decision from our core, and turn it into a powerful commitment, there’s no stopping us. Our success becomes inevitable. It’s just a matter of time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I read dozens of books on honesty, direct communication, and being more authentic and less nice.<span class="Footnotes-1 CharOverride-11">

 Practicing what I was reading was hard work. In fact, it was extremely uncomfortable. I realized being direct, honest, and vulnerable with people I knew was even harder than approaching an attractive stranger and starting a conversation. If a stranger rejected me, I could always tell myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">Well, they don’t know the real me.</span>
 But if a friend or lover rejected me after I revealed a desire, fear, or anything else personal, that was a different story.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Books were good, but changing on my own was slow going. I realized I needed help. I needed to be surrounded by people who were also practicing this and could support me and teach me along the way. I needed faster results. I needed coaching.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I joined a men’s group. We met every Tuesday night from 6-8p.m. to discuss our challenges, goals, and lives. To work through our fears, understand our feelings, heal our old wounds, upgrade our beliefs, and show up more powerfully in the world. I was the youngest man in the group by at least a decade, and I brought the thunder. I wanted to change this and I wanted to change it now!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While in the group, I also discovered a unique form of personal growth workshops in Portland, Oregon called Solsara. They held 3-day weekend immersions where the core purpose was to practice being more authentic, honest, and direct with others. They were incredible experiences, and my future wife, Candace, happened to be one of the teachers.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">With all the reading, group work, and coaching, I began to reprogram my mind. I let go of old, toxic beliefs that kept me feeling overly responsible for others and guilty. I shattered fears that prevented me from expressing what I felt, asking for what I wanted, and saying no when I didn’t want to do something. I reached a new level of authenticity and confidence that felt incredible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, best of all, as I became more open to the world, more vulnerable, more truly myself, I felt more love than ever before. I was able to let in and feel all the love coming my way, because I was no longer hiding huge portions of myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And guess what?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now all my problems are solved and life is a fairy tale of perpetual bliss and comfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Oh, if only.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Actually, my journey continues to this day. Being in a deeply committed, amazing marriage requires even higher levels of honesty, directness, and a willingness to have uncomfortable conversations. To truly thrive in a relationship, we have to be able to talk about the hard stuff–sex, money, parenting decisions, and so many other things that can push our buttons. We have to navigate the balance between supporting each other, taking care of our small children, and still have time to nourish ourselves. This means sometimes saying yes, and sometimes saying no. Sometimes being selfless and sometimes being selfish. As you’ll see in the stories I share below, it’s not always smooth. In fact, it can be quite messy, and I’m far from perfect.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As I carry out my mission in the world of Mass Liberation—to eradicate social anxiety and inspire confidence in as many people as possible—my reach continues to grow and expand. This involves building an online presence that reaches hundreds of thousands of people through YouTube, podcasting, blogs, books, and other teaching platforms. The more people I reach, the more people there are to interact with. More people who want something, ask me for something, and sometimes expect me to do something. And, of course, there are more people who dislike me, what I teach, and what I’m up to. More opportunities to determine what I actually want, to say no, and to let go of responsibility for everyone’s feelings. More necessity to further stamp out people-pleasing and any fear-based nice guy behaviors.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">From my years on this path, I can say one thing with certainty: It gets better. As you let go of niceness, guilt, pleasing others, and fear of conflict, everything improves. Your relationships get better, your self-esteem skyrockets, your sense of personal and social power increase, your career and business success surge, and you feel more relaxed around people in all situations.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s not an easy journey, and it doesn’t happen in one step. But if you are committed and if you are willing to do what it takes, then it’s worth it. Your life can transform in extraordinary, delightful ways.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the next few chapters we will uncover the core qualities of niceness. You’ll discover the major patterns that keep you feeling afraid, doubtful, guilty, or any other way that doesn’t serve you. These include people-pleasing, over-responsibility for others’ experiences, and fear of confrontation or conflict. As you read, you’ll probably see yourself time and again in the descriptions and stories below. That’s good! The more insight you have into what’s holding you back, the faster you can break free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, before we dive into the core qualities of niceness, let’s take a moment to see how nice you are.</p>
