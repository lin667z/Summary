<h4 class="Header-02">Is That a Nice Way Of Saying No?</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As I’ve practiced being less nice and more real, my emails have become more direct and clear. Here is an example of me communicating with a colleague with whom I have an acquaintance-level relationship. I’ve interviewed her for my podcast and she provided me some assistance with one of my books. We have not spent time together socially, and don’t know each other very well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A few weeks back she sent me this email. I’ve shortened it to remove any identifying information.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hi Aziz!</p>
<p class="Email-Text">How are ya? I hope all is well--the last time we emailed was about your book. How did it go!? I am not sure if I told you, but my book is FINALLY done.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Since you just went through it I was wondering if you had any insights into the best outlets / tactics for selling books--any words of wisdom?</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Anyways, I just figured you would have some good ideas AND I don&apos;t think I had updated you on everything = )</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Cheers,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Captain Awesome</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">(Captain awesome is not how she signed her email. That’s my own edit).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">She seemed excited and I wanted to help her out. I know a little about book launches and promotions, but I have a friend who is a wizard at it. So I decided to offer a chance for the three of us to pow-wow on how to help her book crush it:</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hey Captain Awesome,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Congrats on completing your book! That must feel awesome</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Checking out the book page on Amazon, I see it’s 300+ pages. Beast. It looks really good and has a great cover.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">As far as selling books, I have a few ideas. And, I happen to know a ninja master who is my Amazon (and other outlet) book selling guru.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">His name is Patrick King - do you know him? He writes a ton about social dynamics, relationships, conversations, confidence, etc.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Here’s my Brilliant Idea:</p>
<p class="Email-Text">The three of us get on a conference call or zoom meeting and talk strategy for your new book. Some of your marketing plan is probably already set because you have a publisher. But I’m guessing there’s still a lot on you as far as promotion. I have some ideas, and Patrick will have some (better) ideas.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I already ran it by him and he’s into it. If this sounds good to you, let me know and we’ll all figure out at time that works in our schedules.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">You see? brilliant. That’s why they call me Wile E. Coyote: Super Genius.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Best,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Aziz</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These last two emails were just set up. This is where it gets really interesting. Here is how she responded to my invitation:</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hey Aziz!</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Oh my goodness you are far too kind! I do not want to take up that much of your time -- I was just pinging for any insights since you had just gone through it. I also feel so bad asking for free advice from consultants -- I always then feel beholden to hire them (and I just hired a book PR person!) As always, you are so generous, any little tidbits would be so appreciated, I don&apos;t want to make y&apos;all get on a call!</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Cheers,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Captain Awesome</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I first read this, I could see that she was declining the invitation, which is fine. But then I started to wonder, does she think there’s some obligation in the help I’m offering? Does she want the assistance, but is she being nice and not wanting to be “selfish”?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the past, I’d probably leave it and just send a friendly email over with a few tips. In the past I would have been nice back. But instead I decided to be real:</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hey Captain Awesome,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hmm, ok. Let me see if I can clarify a little.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I am not a marketing consultant and neither is Patrick. He’s a full-time author and I… well I do all kinds of things : )</p>
<p class="Email-Text">In any case, my intention is to serve you and build a relationship. No obligation, no expectation. I’ve found that building strong relationships with other inspiring people in my field is rewarding and makes life more fun. You are one of those people.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I know Patrick feels similarly. In fact, we have casually discussed creating a Private Facebook group for people who are successfully running businesses in the confidence / communication / personal growth space. A way to learn from each other and continue to reach and serve more people.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">So, if you’d like to meet via phone, I think you’d get a lot more info than some tips via email, and it could be fun and exciting.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I’m not sure if your response is not wanting to impose or perhaps a nice way of saying no? If it’s the latter, that&apos;s ok to. I respect you being able to say no and decide what’s right for you.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Let me know either way.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Best,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Aziz</p>
<p class="Email-Text">P.S. If you’re doing a promo tour for your book and want to do an interview for my podcast, we could promote it on there. We have about 30-35,000 downloads per month now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Before sending the email, I re-read it to make sure it captured my authentic response. I wanted to clarify that it was a gift offered freely and point out that a phone meeting would provide much more value for her. That paragraph towards the end about her response being a nice way of saying no was something I was genuinely curious about. And it felt edgy for me to ask so directly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I pressed send. There, I thought. <span class="CharOverride-9">That’s me being authentic and not being so nice. Great job, Aziz. Practicing what you preach.</span>
 So far so good, until... the creeping dread started to ooze its way under the door into my psyche. <span class="CharOverride-9">Geez, that was awfully direct. You sound pissed off. She’s going to think that you felt rejected and then got all huffy and pissed off about it. She’s not going to want to speak with you after this. You totally ruined that connection. Way too direct.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I reminded myself that <span class="CharOverride-10">I want to live in a world where I am more bold than nice.</span>
 Where I express my authentic responses and ask real questions, even if it’s uncomfortable. And then I moved on with my life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Several days later I received this email:</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Thanks Aziz! I am very grateful--I think really, really honestly it is because I dread phone conversations. LOL. As a recovering awkward person I LOVE my email [safe]. Anyways, I am about to leave on a 2 week media tour so I do not want to clog your inbox. If you think of anything ping it my way!</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Cheers,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Captain Awesome</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Fair enough. So it was a nice way of saying no. As is almost always the case, my fears about the terrible reactions and the End Times that will come from me being more direct do not happen. Instead, she revealed more and there seemed to be no hard feelings. I sent her a few tips via email and that was that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Each and every day we have dozens of opportunities to make a bold move and be more direct, more authentic, and a little less nice. Any time it’s outside of your comfort zone, you may experience some internal freak-out after doing so, but remember, that’s to be expected. It’s a sign you are taking risks and being yourself, which only brings about good things in the long run.</p>
