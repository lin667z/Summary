<h4 class="Header-02">Full Permission</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Once you have identified what you truly want and asked for it directly, you might find that you get it. Hurray! Well, maybe. Many recovering nice people, myself included, can have difficulty receiving. Whether it’s some time for yourself, going to the restaurant you want, or your partner touching you in that new and exciting way you asked for, it can be hard to relax and enjoy yourself. Instead, your mind might become active with worry, and you may feel guilt or anxiety.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Is this really OK? Do they really want to be here? Are they upset with me right now? Are they enjoying this too, or is it all just for me?</span>
 These thoughts, and many others can cloud your mind and prevent you from really enjoying the experience. They seem to be a normal part of the Boldness Training process and diminish over time. They are a sign that you have not fully bought into the idea that it’s OK to ask for what you want and to act in your healthy self-interest.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">They could also be a sign that you don’t say no very much, so you assume others don’t as well. The more relaxed and capable you become with saying no, the more you trust others will do the same. This helps you know that if they granted your request, it’s because they wanted to. If it was because they were scared to say no, that’s on them, and they have some inner work to do. We will transform your relationship with “no” in the next chapter so you can easily and calmly decline anything you want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the meantime, give yourself full permission to receive and enjoy. While the fear, doubt, and guilt may still pop up, do your best to ignore them. Instead of feeding them with your attention, simply dismiss them as signs of remaining over-niceness leaving your body. Then, bring your attention fully into the present.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re spending some cherished time alone, see what sounds delightful to do. Watch that movie that your partner would never want to go see. Go for a run. Eat your favorite kind of food. Speaking of food, if you’re at the restaurant and wondering if your friend really wants to be here, or just said yes to please you, bring yourself out of your mind and into the moment. What is the restaurant like? What is the atmosphere, the sounds, the smells? Why do you love this place? Pay attention to your friend. How is she doing? What’s going on in her life? And if you’re so fortunate as to be receiving that new touch you requested from your partner... tune in to your body, my friend, because you don’t want to miss out on that one. What does it feel like? Bring your attention to the physical sensations, sounds, and pleasure of being touched how you like.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You deserve this. It’s OK to receive. People love you and want to support you and help you meet your needs. You’re not bad. You’re beautiful.</p>
