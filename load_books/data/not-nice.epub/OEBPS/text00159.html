Being Known</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you’ve seen throughout this book, being the nice person is driven by the need for approval from others. This need can influence how we approach all people, in all interactions, and make our primary intent to be liked. This leads to a phenomenon known as impression management, where you’re monitoring how you come across, and adjusting what you say or do to mold others’ perceptions of you. This habit creates tension, social anxiety, and stress.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you step out of fear-based niceness and into bold authenticity, you need a new goal. If your primary purpose isn’t to make sure everyone likes you, then what is it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To be known.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re spending time with someone, and your goal is to get them to like you, then you will avoid certain topics, smile politely, and do a dozen others things from the nice-person playbook. But if your primary goal is simply to get to know the other person, and let them know you, what would you do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And what does that even mean, to get to know someone? Is it learning all the information about their past? Where they went to school, who they dated, how many jobs they’ve had and where? While that’s certainly part of getting to know someone, it’s only a small piece of the equation. You can know all that information and feel no connection with someone whatsoever. Or, you can just meet someone and feel like you’ve known them a lifetime, and yet know very little about their past.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, what actually creates that sense of knowing someone?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Knowing someone comes from sharing what is really happening inside, transparently and vulnerably.</span>
 It requires authentic expression of what we’re experiencing in the moment. This includes what we’re thinking, feeling, noticing, and perceiving. What we want and don’t want, like and don’t like. Not some watered-down, heavily filtered version of this, but what’s actually happening inside of us. What’s actually true.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When two people are doing this, the conversation becomes engaging. Even if they don’t agree on all topics, there is a strong connection because both people are fully present, fully there in the moment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In contrast, when we come from a place of wanting to be liked, we are not fully there. We are hiding large parts of ourselves, and much of our attention is in our heads, filtering what we’ll say next to get the person to see us in a certain way. This lack of presence is instantly felt subconsciously by others, and they become less engaged and less interested, even if we’re being friendly and asking all the “right” questions. Energy trumps content every time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So what if you decided, right now, that from now on your goal in being with others was not to be liked, but to be known? To share who you are, and find out who they are. Or, as one of my clients put it in his words: “To connect and have fun.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you make this choice, and act upon it, you will discover another paradox of niceness. When you stop trying to be liked, and your intention is just to share who you are, as you are, guess what happens? That’s right – people like you way more. They are naturally drawn to you, and there is an ease and effortlessness about how you attract them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You, as you are, right now, are enough. You can share yourself. Be yourself. Reveal yourself. You don’t have to wait until you’re better, or you have it all sorted out, or you don’t have negative feelings. You don’t have to read eighteen more self-development books on how to share and communicate better. You can be you. It’s OK. It’s safe. I promise.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, me telling you that, and you knowing that, might be two different things. Which actually brings us to the final section of this book, which is all about what matters most: Action.</p>
