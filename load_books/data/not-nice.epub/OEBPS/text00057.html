<h4 class="Header-02">Liberating Your Desire</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">My son Arman, who just turned one year old, is going through a phase right now where he will urgently express his desire using his most advanced communication skills. These include looking you in the eye, shouting “uggghhh” at the top of his lungs, and loudly pounding on the table with his chubby little hands.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My other son, Zaim, who just turned three, is more sophisticated: “Daddy, come upstairs and play with me. Daddy, feed me please. Daddy, I want proteins and almond milk.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Both of these little guys are aware of their desires. They know what they want, and they are free to immediately ask for it (or demand it, as the case may be). But if the answer is no, they are in no way dissuaded from getting what they want. Here’s a sample exchange between Zaim and me:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Daddy, come upstairs and play with me.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That sounds like fun, buddy. We’re going to eat dinner in about two minutes, though, so let’s stay down here.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Let’s play upstairs for two minutes.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“You really want to play upstairs right now? Let’s set the table, eat some food, then play upstairs.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Let’s play upstairs <span class="CharOverride-9">now</span>
 , Daddy!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’ve ever been involved in one of these conversations, you know how persistent and surprisingly compelling these little negotiation masters can be. They’re clear about what they want, and they don’t make it mean something terrible about them if you say no.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And you were exactly the same way as a young child. You knew what you wanted and you went for it. Can you remember any instances like that? Do you remember how much you wanted certain things, and how strongly you advocated them? A certain game, watching a certain show, getting a new bike.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But then you learned that it was not permissible to ask for what you want. Sometimes when you persisted, your parents may have gotten irritable and told you to knock it off, or shut up. This may have been stated directly, or more subtly with voice tone or “the look”. Eventually, you may have concluded unconsciously that saying what you want, or advocating for it strongly, was bad. Maybe it’s better to be quiet, compliant, and pleasing. To not push so hard. To be nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">From these early conclusions, you formed negative beliefs about desire and what you want. These may take the form of stories or beliefs such as the following:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">It’s bad to want things.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I want too much.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I’m bad for wanting so much.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">It’s bad to want _______ (insert whatever it is you really want here).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">It’s greedy or selfish to want that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I’m greedy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I’m selfish.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">...and many more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s clear this up right now. <span class="CharOverride-10">It’s not bad to want things.</span>
 Despite what you may have been taught, your inner desires are not bad, wrong, unhealthy, or shameful. That is simply layers and layers of cultural and nice-person conditioning.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Desire is what moves life on this planet. It’s the most universal force in all life. Every single living organism wants things, and move towards what it wants, be it food, shelter, sex, or even sunlight for trees. Is a tree bad for wanting to reach towards the sunlight? Is a lion wrong for wanting to eat a zebra? When we think of it in these contexts, it sounds absurd, doesn’t it? So, are you bad for wanting to travel somewhere, to eat something, or to sleep with someone? Are you bad for wanting less time with someone, or more time with someone?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There is no good or bad here, there’s just what you want and what you don’t want. As you’ll see in the chapters on Speaking Up and Being More Selfish, you can choose whether you want to act on your desire and ask for it. In some instances, you may decide to override your want and let it go. But that comes from a place of self-love and choice, not fear and shame.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s time to stop smashing down this piece of who you are. It’s time to turn inwards and re-discover what it is you <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 want, across all situations in your life. Below are some empowering beliefs you can choose to adopt right now that will help you get more in touch with what you want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s good to discover what I want</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s good to ask for what I want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s good to say what I want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s good to say what I don’t want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s good to be able to put myself first.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">(That last one might be a doozy for you. We’ll talk more about that in Chapter 10, which is all about the dreaded S-word: Selfish.)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These statements are all true. These are a part of your upgraded, more accurate map of human relationships. In any relationship, whether it’s with a colleague, boss, friend, or your life partner, identifying what you want and being able to express it will enhance your relationship. A chronic pattern of being unsure, never knowing what you want, looking to others, letting them make the decisions, and always putting them first will create resentment in you, frustration and resentment in them, and eventually create distance that erodes the relationship.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In addition, if you perpetually look to meet the needs of others, and disregard what you truly want, you diminish over time. You have less energy, vitality, and passion. You feel less happy and fulfilled. Over time you whittle away and have little to offer others because your cup is so empty.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Hence, if you want great relationships, and you want to feel better in those relationships, it’s good to discover what you want, ask for what you want, say what you don’t want, and be able to put yourself first sometimes. You may be nodding your head as you read this, intellectually realizing that this is all true. Let’s take a moment, though, to bring these ideas out of your head and into your body and emotions, because that’s what makes the difference between information and transformation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, give yourself some time to focus on these new empowering beliefs. Write them out ten times in a journal, or fifty times. Repeat them often to yourself. Put them on a note card and carry it in your back pocket. Then throughout the day, when you have a few moments to kill time, instead of flicking on your phone and compulsively checking news, sports stats, social media, or something equally unproductive, take a few breaths, slow down, and read through your little note card. You’ll be amazed how much this will open up the floodgates. Because, being aware of your desire and expressing it freely isn’t some unnatural new ability you have to train yourself to do, like juggling. This is one of your most basic, innate, hardwired abilities that is right there underneath the surface as soon as you stop pushing it down.</p>
