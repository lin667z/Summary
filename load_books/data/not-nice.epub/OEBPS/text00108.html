<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">First things first, we need to define what selfish means. According to the dictionary, it means you lack consideration for others or are concerned chiefly with your own personal profit or pleasure. So far, that doesn’t sound super great. But watch this.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s say you want to see movie A and your friend wants to see movie B. If you advocate for movie A, is that selfish? If you refuse to see movie B, is that selfish? You may have an immediate answer to these questions, or it might depend on the context.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do we almost always go to the movies I want and rarely to the movies you want? Did you do something generous for me earlier that day? Do we go to the movies I want because I go to the opera with you once per month? Is your movie choice something I’d kind of dislike, or is it my least favorite genre in the world?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now it’s getting more complex. And subjective. Because the truth is “selfish” is in the eye of the beholder. It’s a calculation based upon how much each person is giving and receiving in the relationship, and what is deemed “fair.” Hence, selfish is not really a simple category that you’re in or out of. Instead, it’s a spectrum.</p>
