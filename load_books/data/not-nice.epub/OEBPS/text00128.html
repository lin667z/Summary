<h4 class="Header-02">Obligation-Based Relationships</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">“How often do you two speak?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“About once a month or so,” she replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Do you enjoy those conversations?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Eh… Sort of. Not really. I feel anxious ahead of time. It feels like there’s so much to catch up on,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I see. Not beforehand...What about during the conversation, or afterwards? Do you feel energized? Lighter, happier, excited?” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Ehhh… No, not really,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why do you do it?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“After a few weeks goes by the pressure starts to build up. I feel like we’re due for a call. Then I wait a week or so more and it becomes so intense I reach out to him. Or if he reaches out to me and leaves a message, I feel like I have to get back to him.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sounds like fun. This is a brief snippet of a conversation I had with a client who was trapped in a web of obligation-based relationships. Pretty much all of her relationships were strongly dictated by obligation: what she should do in order to do what others wanted and thus be a good person.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These kinds of relationships are born from avoidance of the word “no.” In order to avoid the tension, discomfort, guilt, or fear of loss, we simply say yes. Yes to spend time with someone, yes to talk on the phone, yes to do what they want. This, like all avoidance, provides short-term relief from uncomfortable feelings. But it generates greater pain in the long-term. The extended phone calls, coffee hangouts, lunches, dinner parties, or other unwanted encounters tend to be unpleasant and agitating. In addition, your own sense of strength and personal power is diminished, leaving you with less ability to boldly be yourself in the world, which creates another layer of pain. And then, while you’re doing all this stuff you don’t really want to do with people you don&apos;t really want to be with, your life is passing you by. You could be filling that time with people you love, doing things that bring you energy, vitality, and joy. Missing out on this is the next layer of pain that comes from avoiding the discomfort of “no” in the short term. As always, avoidance equals pain.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We often have belief systems we’ve adopted that support our need to sustain obligation-based friendships: It’s good to be a team player. It’s important to sustain friendships for a lifetime. You can’t leave friends. Friends don’t just leave each other. Friends are forever. If you don’t nurture these relationships, you’ll be all alone when you’re older. You have to be there for family–always and no matter what.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These, and many more, are a mish-mash of ideas we’ve heard, things parents told us, and our own values. They merge together into all-or-nothing rules that have very little nuance for the complexity of life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Friends are forever? But what if I don’t enjoy spending time with a certain friend anymore? What if our connection was based on the fact that we worked together and could talk about our co-workers? What if I’ve grown a lot and they are still similar to when we first became friends ten years ago? What if they tell long stories that I don’t enjoy and don’t ever seem interested in my life?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same goes for our obligation-based relationships with family. I should be there for my parents (or brother, sister, uncle, etc.). This could be a core value of yours–to support and be there for family. But what does that mean? In all cases, no matter what? Does that mean everything from being at the hospital bed to picking up their laundry? Does that mean you can’t say no to flying out of state to attend your uncle’s 60th birthday party?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I understand that family relationships are complex and sometimes involve doing things we are not excited about. This is because we value the connection and understand that doing something for others is part of sustaining a long-lasting relationship. The key, however, is to determine to what extent you will go. You just might find that you can say no to a lot more of the small stuff, while still saying yes to the big stuff.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One client in my Mastermind program was struggling with an obligation-based relationship with her mother. Her father had passed away several years earlier, and she was the child who got along best with her mom. She would go over to her house regularly to help her garden, attend church with her on Sundays, and call her frequently. She was struggling, however, because she didn’t like going to the church and she hated gardening. She was frustrated and wished her siblings would help out more, although attempts to push them into doing so had been unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the group call we explored her options. I started by having her explore her CSI (complete self-interest) desires. That’s where you ask yourself what you really want in a situation, if you knew the other people involved would be completely fine with your decision. In this case it was: “If you could choose anything you wanted and you knew your mother would be fine and feel great about it, what would it be?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It turned out to be way less contact, and different activities entirely. Did she really need to garden with her mom? Could they do something else together? Did she have to attend church with her? How often did she want to call her? What did she actually want to talk about on the phone? These are the kinds of questions that freed her up to choose a way to connect with and support her mother that were more engaging, nourishing, and fun for her as well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In many cases, our strong internal dictate of “be there for others 100%,” which sounds like a noble virtue, is actually a clever form of avoiding saying no. We are scared to do something and feel guilty for doing it, so we take control by saying it’s part of our values. This keeps us locked into behaving this way, no matter what it actually feels like inside. Is it working for you? How would you know?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To discover what’s really true, slow down and pay attention, especially when you agree to do something with someone, or after you’ve spend time with them. Do you feel energized after the activity? Do you feel lighter, happier, and more optimistic? These are the signals of positive, beneficial connection that is nourishing you. Even if you don’t love the activity, like the gardening for example, perhaps spending time with someone you love feels good in a deep way. Knowing you brightened your mom’s day warms your heart.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or do you feel drained afterwards? When you slow down and pay attention, and honestly check in with yourself, do you feel resistant, upset, negative, frustrated, or resentful? Do you drive home pissed off at your brother because he never does gardening and he should, dammit? Do you have an urge to call him up and chew him out for not doing enough with Mom? Do you feel tense in your body? Does your back hurt when you wake up in the morning before gardening day? <span class="CharOverride-9">(Must have slept on it wrong…)</span>
 These are signs to pay attention to. These are indicators on your dashboard that you are out of alignment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The way out of obligation-based relationships is to begin with asking yourself the million-dollar question–what do I want? When you do, go out as far as possible on the selfish spectrum. For just a moment, let go of what you “should do,” or what is acceptable, or what the other person would think. Just try it on. You don’t have to buy it. Just see what that feels like to tune into your heart and see what you really want, deep down. Then, and only then, you can work your way back to the nuances of the situation to see how to steer it. What can you shift? What can you change?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A number of years ago I learned how to do this when my parents or brother would visit me. In the past I would be 100% available, planning on just hanging out from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening. That would mean dinner on Friday, breakfast on Saturday, followed by all day hanging out together, non-stop. Then repeat that again for round two on Sunday. And if my folks came in on a Thursday, well I’ll have dinner with them on Thursday before we kick off the weekend immersion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">By the end of the weekend, without my typical alone time, self-care, and things I did for fun, I would feel burnt-out, sensitive, and irritable. Then I would conclude I felt this was because I was a bad son, or brother, or perhaps just a bad human being.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I brought up this pattern in my men’s group, the leader asked me, “What would your ideal visit look like?” Simple question, and one I had surprisingly never thought about. I had been making the assumption for years that what my parents or brother wanted was me all day, every day. After all, they lived in different states and we didn’t see each other all the time. So, I asked myself what I really wanted, feeling quite uncomfortable in just the asking of the question.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well,” I paused, hesitating, “I guess dinner Friday would be nice when they come in. Then I’d have the morning to myself to read, make breakfast, and work out. Then I could meet up with them in the early afternoon. I’d love to take them for a hike out in the Gorge; that would be fun. Maybe have some time with Dad to get his ideas on investing. Instead of going out on Saturday, I’d love to eat one of Mom’s meals. Maybe I could help her cook. Then Sunday I’d like to have the morning on my own again, then meet up in the afternoon for a movie and some hanging out. Then have the evening to myself and relax before the week begins.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As I write it now, it sounds so fun and I feel love for my parents. As I spoke it then, I felt tension, fear, and guilt. How could I be such a bad son? They’ve come all this way and I don’t even want to see them in the mornings? For shame!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But at this point in my life, I knew I had to do what scared me if I wanted to grow and create the life I wanted. I also had a growing clarity that acting in my healthy self-interest and having boundaries allowed me to truly love others and deeply connect with them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Despite some spasms of guilt as I carried it out over the next several visits, they went well. My parents seemed delighted by me saying what I wanted more and were game to do what I wanted. In fact, they were looking to me to suggest what we could do. The space in between periods together helped me recharge and take care of myself, so I felt more energized and engaged.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It went so well that I actually decided a number of years ago that I am only going to spend time in relationships that energize me and enhance my life. My time here is finite and there are so many people I like and love, I do not want to spend time with anyone that drains me. I slowly moved away from and ended relationships that did not serve me, including ones with drama, chaos, or frequent negativity. Over time, my energy rose higher and higher. Now I am surrounded by supportive, inspiring, intelligent, and loving people. I spend time with those that bring out the best in me and inspire me to grow even more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I only work with clients I like. Those who I feel love and connection for and who inspire and excite me with their motivation, openness, and heart. I only spend time with friends who are bright lights, who are intelligent, motivated, self-aware, loving, and amazing people. I only spend time with family members who I deeply love and connect with, like my brother, dad, mom, and some aunts, uncles, and cousins.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sure, I still see other family members at weddings, funerals, and other events, but I don’t have ongoing contact with them. I ended friendships that didn’t serve me. I concluded with clients who weren’t at level 4 or 5 of motivation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Life without obligation-based relationships is full of so much more love, appreciation, energy, freedom, and fun. I highly recommend you take the actions you need to create your own path to more choice in your relationships. In fact, let’s see what that would actually look like for you, so you can start acting on that more and more.</p>
