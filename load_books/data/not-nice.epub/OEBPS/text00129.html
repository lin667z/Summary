<span class="CharOverride-9">“Anything less than a hell yes is a hell no.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">- Rich Litvin</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The choice is yours. You can choose to avoid the Creeping Dread and carry out a series of obligation-based relationships, all the while feeling more drained, dissatisfied, and resentful. Or, you can choose to give yourself permission to say no. Not because it was allowed, or because everyone else would agree, but simply because you wanted to.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my teachers who’ve I’m mentioned before, Rich Litvin, taught me about the idea of “hell yes” or “hell no.” He was sharing this when it came to working with clients. He wanted both his clients and himself to be a “hell yes” on working together. If they felt ambivalent about it, or if he didn’t feel fully on board, then it wasn’t a hell yes, and so he would not work with them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I instantly loved this concept and began expanding it to all areas of life. What if you only did things that were a “hell yes”? <span class="CharOverride-9">Impossible! Outrageous! Offensive!</span>
 I get it, it’s not the typically nice way of being in the world. In fact, it might even seem selfish. But is it really?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Is spending time with someone out of obligation enjoyable for them? If you agree to go somewhere you don’t really want to be, are you that fun to be around? Perhaps you’re the world’s greatest actor, but most people can’t fully hide their displeasure. It might not be obvious, but most likely your energy is lower, you are a little tighter in your body, and shorter with your words. In other words, you’re probably less fun to be around.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s do a little experiment to see what your life would be like if you only did your “hell yes(ses).” Take out a sheet of paper, or open up a file on your phone or computer, and make a list. Write down all the things you do on a regular basis in both your professional and personal life. For example:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Write book</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Go to gym</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Time with boys</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Make breakfast</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Make smoothies</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Team meeting with Jenee</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Emails</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Prepare materials for live event</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Plan schedule for live event</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Record podcasts</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Record videos</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Lunch date with Candace</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Session with 1-on-1 client</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Session with potential client</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Session with 1-on-1 client</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is just a sample. Your list would be longer than this, most likely. Be sure to include all of the activities you do regularly at work and in your personal life. Go ahead and do that now, before reading any further.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Welcome back. Did you get everything? Now, go through and rank each item on your list. Yes, every single one. Put a “Y” next to the ones that are a “hell yes” for you, and an “N” next to the ones that are a “hell no” for you. Remember, anything less than a “hell yes” is a “hell no,” so if you’re hesitating and hovering, trying to decide, it’s probably a “hell no.” Do this now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, what did you notice? Is your life filled with more Y’s or N’s? Did this surprise you? Or does it make sense? Typically, if our lives are filled with a majority of “hell no(s)” that we’re doing anyway because we feel like we have to, we feel worse. If it’s full of “hell yes(ses)” that we have chosen, we feel better.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you look at your list, do you want to change anything? Are there any hell noes you could let go of? Stop doing entirely? Delegate to someone else? Take a few minutes to really ponder this. It might not be all of them, all at once, but what if you could just start with one, or a few. How would that impact how you feel?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I like to do this process every three months or so, for both my business and personal life. My goal in my business is to do only what I love. That doesn’t mean only what’s easy. There are things that I don’t quite love because they’re challenging, or uncomfortable, or stir up fear and feelings of rejection. Those are still a “hell yes” for me because my life is not about avoiding discomfort, it’s about doing what scares me in the service of something greater. It’s about being a force for good and a warrior of the light.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But there are many things that I didn’t enjoy doing that were not a hell yes. So, they were a hell no and I found a way to stop doing them. These include editing my own videos and podcasts, uploading and posting them, managing social media posts, coordinating the logistics of live events, and dozens of other tasks in my business. This allows me to focus on working with clients, running groups, creating, writing, recording, reading, teaching, and all the other stuff that I love doing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same goes for my personal life. I don’t know about you, but I love cleaning up dishes in the sink and putting them in the dishwasher. Perhaps because it’s such a simple task and it’s relatively easy and quick. Perhaps because it is so tangible and I get to see the results of my efforts instantaneously. I don’t know exactly why, but it’s a hell yes for me. Cleaning my toilet? Not so much. Deep cleaning on the stove under the burners? Ew. So, we hired someone to come for three hours per week to do that sort of cleaning. One more hell no off my list.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, when it comes to life with small children, I do end up doing things that are not a hell yes for me. When it’s dinner time and my son loudly proclaims he has to poop and wants me to read a story to him while he does so, that’s not necessarily a hell yes for me. Sometimes, I will find it in me to make it a hell yes. I’ll get playful, find perspective, and see the sweetness of his desire for some alone time with me (even though it’s in the bathroom), or even bring the rest of my dinner in there to tell him a story while I eat. Yes, it’s as glamorous as it sounds.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes, when I really don’t want to, I’ll say, “How about I get you started and then I’ll come back out and eat.” Offering this shows me if he really needs to go or if he just wants some story time with daddy. I then offer this: “I can tell you a story while we eat at the table. Do you want to do that?” And if I don’t feel like telling a story, I offer to read a book.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even within the realm of being a child-centric parent who values giving to your kids, there’s room to find the hell yes for you. This is essential or you will go insane.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My point here is even when we feel like we can’t say no to something, we still have wiggle room. We still have the choice of how we want to do it, and alternatives we can offer. Once we’re no longer terrified of their reaction to our alternatives, we can get a lot more creative.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s also helpful to realize that you always have a choice. Everything you do is a choice. This is one of the core realizations that helps you be an owner of your life instead of a victim. I’m choosing how I want to parent based on my values. You are choosing where you want to work, and what kind of work you want to do. You’re choosing how to respond to your spouse, boss, coworkers, friends, parents, and everyone else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As your niceness decreases and your authenticity and power grow, you will see that no one is “making” you do something. In truth, the only thing that creates that perception is the fear and guilt we feel if we imagine saying no. It’s not them, it’s us. We are “making” ourselves do it. With our own internal demands, our own need to have strict adherence to being a “good” son, daughter, father, mother, employee, spouse, or friend.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This can all shift once you start to decide what is a hell yes and what is a hell no for you, and to stick to it. It’s uncomfortable at first, and then becomes much easier, much more a part of who you are and what you do. In fact, let’s look at an example of this in action right now.</p>
