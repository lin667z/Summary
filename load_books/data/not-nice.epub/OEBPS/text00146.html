 ules</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">What if there were no rules? What if you could do whatever you wanted?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, before you dismiss that question and say, “Come on, Aziz, obviously there are rules, so this is pointless. Besides, without rules, people would pillage, rape, and murder each other. It would be chaos.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This kind of dismissive response is actually the nice-person programming speaking, not you. It’s what you would call a straw man argument, and it’s a favorite among debaters and politicians all over the world. It’s when you put forth an extreme example and then discredit it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Bob</span>
 : I think we should stop giving money to group A and instead give it to groups B and C.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Allen</span>
 : Do you want people in group A to die in the street?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, most likely, Bob does not want anyone to die in the street. But this extreme example makes shifting the money allocation around look bad. After all, doing so would lead to people dying in the street.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is exactly what your nice-person programming does when you start looking beyond life in your cage of rules. Instead of simply dismissing the idea though, what if you really considered it? If there were no rules on what you could say or do, what would you do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If your mind keeps going to bank robberies and stolen G6’s, then we can put this qualifier on the thought experiment. Assuming there are still laws in place, and this isn’t The Purge, what would you do? So you can’t rob banks or prowl the streets of downtown LA with a chainsaw, but you can say anything you want, relate to others however you want, ask for whatever you want, and say no to anything. What would you do with no rules?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Interesting to imagine, huh?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And if you could change, or completely let go of three of your most restrictive rules, what would that be like? How would you feel? What would you do in your life?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Look back at your list of shoulds and select the three worst offenders. Which are the ones that have caused you the most pain, frustration, restriction, and self-hatred? Which ones are the electric fence that confine you or the hammer that bludgeons you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment now to find your three.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For me, currently, I’d say these are the ones that cause the most pressure, anxiety, or self-judgment:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be able to help anyone become completely and permanently confident, instantly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should reach more people, serve them more, and earn more, now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should always want to play with my kids.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, to break these rules, I can simply forget helping people, forget my mission in the world, and forget my kids. Done and done!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you might find with your top three, it’s more complicated than that. Usually our biggest rules are related to what we value and how we want to live in the world, so we can’t just throw them out entirely. For example, perhaps you had a rule that is from this list:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be more outgoing and charming.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be able to speak up in a group and command the room.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should eat healthier.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should lose weight.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should spend more time with my spouse.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never hurt anyone’s feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never say no to someone in need.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should give more than I do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s just a short list of potentials. Notice how each one reflects an underlying value. Can you spot it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I should be more outgoing and charming” highlights a desire to connect with others. This person values making friends, finding love, growing in their business, or being a leader. Maybe they also value freedom, expressiveness, and authenticity. Those are all great things!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If someone’s rule is “I should lose weight,” what do they value? Health, vitality, aesthetic beauty. Perhaps there’s also a value for love and connection if they perceive that being in better shape will help them receive more love from others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same is true for your top three rules as well. Each one reflects your values. For each one, write down what it shows you value. Just a few sentences or bullet points is all we’re talking about here, nothing fancy. And don’t try to make it sound good either. If you want to lose weight because you want to get laid, then write that down. Sex, connection, companionship, love, or whatever else you imagine it will bring you. No one is going to see this list and no one’s going to judge you. This is about you liberating yourself, not trying to look good to imaginary people. Write those out now, then keep reading.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What did you discover?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How was it to do this exercise? I noticed it really stirred things up in me, creating some feelings of anxiety and sadness. It also brought up some existential questions, like the purpose of life and how we want to live. Maybe it wasn’t so deep for you, but it might have kicked up some feelings. If so, that’s good. Because <span class="CharOverride-10">the rules are designed to control behavior without allowing you to fully feel.</span>
 But feeling in your heart, discomfort and all, is the only way to truly discover the answer to your deepest questions. How do I want to live? What really matters to me? What is my life about?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here’s what emerged as I did this exercise:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">I should be able to help anyone become completely and permanently confident, instantly.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This shows that I want to help people. I want to alleviate suffering and create liberation. I want people to love themselves and be able to love others, feel powerful, worthy, and free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This shows that I value freedom, love, contribution, and mastery.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">I should reach more people, serve them more, and earn more, now.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This shows I have a big mission and a desire to positively impact the world. It also shows me I still have a piece of my self-worth determined by how many people I help, and how much money I earn.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This shows I value contribution and significance.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">I should always want to play with my kids.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This shows that I love my kids. I value love, being with them, bringing them joy, and deeply connecting with them at their level.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Doing this exercise, I realized how much I value love and contribution. I also see how I value significance, and how doing so can trip me up. Especially if I have the game setup to make it very hard to earn that significance. I can see how there’s an element of “I’ll be worthy when…” in some of my rules. I’ll be worthy when I can help people better. I’ll be worthy when I’ve reached enough people. I’ll be worthy when I’ve made enough money.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are dangerous requirements for significance because in my experience they’re never enough. The more you hit your target, the farther out the goal becomes. This is the standard MO of the high achiever and the perfectionist, both of which I identify with (even though I don’t like the sound of the second one).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What did you see about yourself? Did it stir up any feelings in you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We’re going to do something else with these rules to help you break free of them, but first let’s address any feelings that came up. Take a few minutes to just feel what’s happening in your heart, your stomach, and anywhere else in your body. Slow down. Feel it, fully. It’s ok. You’re safe, and you can handle this. There’s nothing wrong, with you, or these feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Just breathe and feel.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Meet any sensation in your body with curiosity, acceptance, and love. Let it know it’s safe for it to be here, and you’re allowing it fully. Gently repeat in your mind, as you focus right on the feelings in your body, “It’s OK. You’re OK.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You’re doing awesome by the way. This rule stuff is no joke. There’s a reason you’ve obeyed them for years or decades.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s see if we can soften the grip even more, and keep the healthy aspect of the rule, while releasing the extreme nature of it that causes us so much pain. Look at the first rule on your list. Can you see the beauty in that rule? Can you see the heartfelt desire underneath? Can you see the nobility in it? Can you love that part of you that wants it so badly?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To see this even more clearly, replace the word “should” with “really want to.” If some of your rules have a “should never,” as in “I should never hurt anyone’s feelings,” you can rewrite this part to reflect what you really want. For example, if you don’t want to hurt others’ feelings, perhaps you want others to feel accepted, loved, and safe around you. In that case, you would write: I really want others to feel accepted, loved, and safe. Here are some more examples:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want be more outgoing and charming.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want be able to speak up in a group and command the room.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want to eat healthier.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want to lose weight.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want to spend more time with my spouse.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want to treat people with kindness and respect.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want to help people in need.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want to give more than I do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you see your rule in this way, can you feel that desire in your heart? Let yourself breathe fully and deeply, and just experience that ache. As you do this, think less and feel more. You don’t need to understand everything that’s happening. As best as you can, just stay with the feelings in your body as you re-read your rules with this new language. If you feel like crying, let yourself cry. This is good. This is healing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, let’s take it one step further. In response to each of your top three rules, written out with “I really want to…” you’re going to write a response. This response is you speaking to yourself, as if you were your own best friend, a loving spouse, or loving parent. Someone who sees the beauty of that desire and deeply appreciates you for it. For example:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">I really want to be able to help anyone become completely and permanently confident, instantly.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course you do! How amazing would that be? What a beautiful desire that fuels you to learn more and more, take risks, and pursue mastery for your entire life. What a powerful driving force. This is amazing. I’m so proud of you, son.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">I really want to reach more people, serve them more, and earn more, now.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I know. And that’s more of that mission, that purpose. It’s a beautiful thing, my man. I really admire that. And I feel grateful that you found that purpose, because it gives you an energy and passion for life that is really inspiring. I love you so much, Aziz.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">I really want to play with my kids.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course you do. They’re beautiful and amazing. They’re so sweet, funny, and delightful. I’m grateful you have them in your life. They give an even deeper purpose that goes beyond your bigger mission in the world. It’s amazing to have them in your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Go ahead and write your responses now. Be as loving, expressive, and warm as you can be, even if you’ve never spoken to yourself like this before. There’s a first time for everything, my friend.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, read this to yourself. Read it over and over, fifty times if needed. Write it on your phone and read it each day in the morning and night. Slow down, and let it in. Be sure to use your name as you do it, because that has a powerful impact on your subconscious mind.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">I love you Aziz.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">You’re enough.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">You don’t have to do anything more to earn my love.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">I love you no matter what.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">You are amazing just as you are.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">I can see how big your heart is, and it’s beautiful.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">I love you.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve done this process with your top three rules, you can experiment with doing it with other rules that cause you pain. As you go about your day, notice when you’re feeling anxious, guilty, or self-critical. See if you can uncover which rule you’ve broken and write it down.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, set aside just a few minutes to go through this process:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">1. Identify the exact rule, and write it down: “I should…”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">2. See what you really value underneath.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">3. Replace “should” with “really want to.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">4. Appreciate yourself for wanting this.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">5. Read your love letter.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Going through this process repeatedly, with different rules, or with the same rule a number of times, will help soften these in your mind. Instead of being a baton that you beat yourself with, they become preferences and desires that guide you in life.</p>
