<h4 class="Header-02">The Opposite of Nice</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The opposite of nice is not to be a jerk, or an asshole. It’s not insulting others, saying bigoted or highly antagonizing things, bullying, or attacking people’s characters. It’s not telling others to “shut up,” intimidating them, or pushing your little old grandma over in the kitchen.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The opposite of nice is being real. It’s being direct, honest, and truthful. It’s saying what you <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 think, expressing how you <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 feel, and sharing what’s true for you in that moment. This authenticity allows others to see and know the real you, which allows you to really feel love and connection.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Not nice means speaking up and asserting yourself, your opinions, ideas, and desires. It’s challenging others when you disagree, standing behind your convictions, and being willing to have difficult conversations. You do this because you want full contact with life and other humans instead of hiding who you are behind a polite wall of fear. When you do have conflict or disagreement, and you inevitably will if you’re being not nice, then you are as vulnerable, skillful, and compassionate as you can be in your communications.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The opposite of nice is knowing who you are, what you believe in, and what you value. It’s you being powerful and going after what you want because you are no longer held back by the fear of what others will think of you. It’s you being fierce, determined, and courageous. It’s you being your best self.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That means you are still kind, caring, attentive, generous, and loving. You still do things for other people, stretch yourself to give, even if it’s hard, and be the kind of leader, mother, father, wife, husband, daughter, son, sister, brother, or friend that you want to be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But you’re not doing that to please others. You’re not doing that so no one ever feels a hint of discomfort. You’re not living in fear of what others will think, in self-doubt, in “Was that good enough?” and “Did everyone there like me?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You come from a place of power. Of choice. Your inner mindset starts to sound like this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I can choose to say yes, and I can choose to say no. I can hold back and keep quiet, or I can ask a tough question that challenges someone. If someone close to me is doing something that annoys me, I can bring it up and talk about it. When I really want something and the first response I get is a no, I ask questions and see if the other person is open to changing their mind. I’m completely free to choose exactly how I want to be in this moment, based on what feels right to me. I am the decider. I am the creator of my life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I no longer avoid, walk on eggshells, tiptoe around, or do the dance.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am me. The real me. And it feels good. I feel powerful. I feel free. I feel worthy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is the opposite of nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re still questioning how this all works, and how being “not nice” can actually be a good thing, you’ll see exactly how soon. In fact, you’ll discover that the more you let go of being nice, the more kind, generous, and truly loving you can be. Because fear, guilt,<br/>
obligation, and distracting self-consciousness don’t make you a more loving person; they create tension and resentment that limit your ability to truly give and love.</p>
