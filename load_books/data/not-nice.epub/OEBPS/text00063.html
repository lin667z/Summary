<h4 class="Header-02">How to Free Yourself<br/>
from Over-Responsibility</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In just a moment, I’m going to share three simple, practical, and powerful tools that you can use immediately to let go of taking too much responsibility for others. These will help you shift the way you feel about others’ feelings. We all know that intellectually telling yourself that you’re not responsible is one thing, but a profound shift in how you feel is what’s going to transform your relationships and your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Before we discuss those, it’s essential to answer this question. What <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 makes people upset?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may have spent years, or decades, imagining it was something you did, or failed to do, that caused the upset in others. You may have run yourself ragged trying to please everyone, so no one would ever feel upset, angry, hurt, or disappointed. You may have done everything to be a nice person.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, in all that hustling, you may not have ever stopped to ask this core question: What really makes people upset? Take a moment to answer it now. What do you think? Is it not getting what we want? When someone is critical or disrespectful towards us? When there’s traffic on the freeway? When our kids don’t obey us?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Any of these things could make someone upset. But underneath all of them is this: we get upset when we perceive our needs are not being met.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Needs are simply core desires that all humans share, across cultures. We have different ways of going about trying to meet these needs, but underneath the core needs are the same. There are many different models for human needs, but the one I’ve found most simple, clear, and practical was Tony Robbins’ six human needs.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03 ParaOverride-4">
<span class="CharOverride-16">The Six Human Needs</span>
</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3"><img class="_idGenObjectAttribute-2" src="Image00002.jpg" alt="" />
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is a quick crash course in these needs, so you can have a better understanding of what actually makes people upset. This will help further liberate you from the feelings of over-responsibility for others’ feelings. For a more in-depth study of these human needs, which I highly recommend, read Tony Robbins’ book: <span class="CharOverride-9">Awaken The Giant Within</span>
 . You can also learn more about these needs and how to use them to rapidly grow your confidence in business, relationships, and life in my in-depth confidence training course, <span class="CharOverride-9">Confidence Unleashed!</span>
 (<span class="CharOverride-9">ConfidenceUnleashedNow.com</span>
 )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For now, here’s what you need to know about these human needs. The first four are our most basic needs that we will find a way to meet no matter what. Healthy or unhealthy, it doesn’t matter. We’ll do whatever we think we need to. For example, to meet our need for certainty, we might do something positive, like take effective action towards an outcome and visualize our success. Or, we might get certainty by saying with complete conviction that we’ll never achieve our goal and it’s pointless to try. Both meet our need for certainty–one positively, and one destructively.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We might meet our need for love and connection by spending time with our partner, slowing down, and sharing what’s happening in our inner world. We are vulnerable, open, listening, and deeply connecting. Or, we might meet that need by opening up a pint of ice cream, sitting on the couch, and binge watching a show on our laptop. This temporarily soothes us and helps us feel connected to ourselves, and the characters on the screen. Again, one form has many positive benefits, the other tends to be destructive over time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These short examples are just scratching the surface of all the ways people try to meet their needs. On top of that, each person has a different priority for their needs. For some people, it’s all about love and connection. They just want to love everybody and have everyone get along. For some people, their dominant need is significance. They want to be number one in all situations, all of the time. To earn more than you, drive a nicer car than you, have a hotter partner than you, and to know more about everything than you. If they don’t achieve this, they feel inadequate, inferior, upset with themselves, and irritable. They try to hide it, but inside they feel shame and anger about not being the best.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, let me ask you this: if you meet someone like this, who’s always searching for significance, and often feels like they’re not enough even though they constantly achieve, are you responsible for their feelings? Is it your job to make sure they feel significant enough all the time?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here’s another question for you. Are there people who don’t want to be connected and similar to others? People who want to be different? Want to be more significant? Or people who create their identity by challenging others, debating, disagreeing, and proving others wrong? People who want to be certain, want to be right, more than they want to get along? Absolutely. And I’m sure you’ve met a few of them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How on earth could we possibly meet these people’s needs? What if their rules for how their needs can be met are completely unrealistic? What if they are prioritizing significance and certainty and it never feels like enough to them? In all of these cases, it’s going to be very difficult for them to feel at peace. They themselves will have a very hard time making this happen. How are you supposed to do this for them? Impossible. Insanity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s time to let it go. You will never be able to make anyone and everyone feel happy. At best you can temporarily meet some of their needs, sometimes. Which is fantastic news. Because you are not responsible to meet all their needs—they are! What a relief.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now that you have even more clarity around what you are not responsible for, and what you can just let go of, let’s turn to some practical tools that will help you do just that.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Peace Process</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This is an extremely helpful tool that I learned from one of my mentors, Christian Mickelsen. It’s a specific type of meditation that can be done sitting with your eyes closed, lying in bed, or as you drive, walk, and carry out other activities.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can use this every time you feel guilt, anxiety, or any other upset about someone else’s feelings. Actually, you can use this anytime you feel any unpleasant feeling at all, but for now let’s focus on using it to release over-responsibility.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment now to think of a person or situation that tends to provoke a sense of guilt or anxiety. Perhaps you are afraid of hurting their feelings, over think what you will say, and feel afraid of upsetting them. Maybe whenever you meet someone new, you tend to take responsibility for their feelings and you get very tense. You worry how you’re coming across and if you’re making them uncomfortable. Once you start to feel that uncomfortable, guilty, anxious, unsettled feeling, congratulations, you’re right on track.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, simply bring your attention out of your thoughts and into your body–right to where you feel that uncomfortable feeling most. It might be a tightening in your stomach, a squeezing in your solar plexus (the area in the center of your body right below your sternum), or a burning feeling in your chest or throat. Take a few breaths and scan your body with your awareness until you find the feelings and then bring your attention right to the center of them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Breathe. Soften and relax your belly, soften and relax your jaw. Often times we unconsciously tense up our bodies in response to an uncomfortable feeling, trying to brace ourselves or get away from it. The Peace Process is the exact opposite of that habit. Instead, we move towards the uncomfortable sensations in our body. Right into the center of it. Like slowly easing yourself into a cold swimming pool or a hot bathtub. Our impulse may be to pull back, but if we just relax our bodies, we can ease in a little further.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you breathe and move towards the sensations in your body, notice your attitude towards these feelings. Most commonly, we don’t like these feelings because they’re uncomfortable, and we want to be rid of them as soon as possible. Our stance towards them is one of frustration, impatience, and irritability. <span class="CharOverride-9">You again? Uggh. I don’t have time for this.</span>
 This frustration, resistance, and avoidance is the very thing that keeps us stuck in the feeling for hours or days. The key is to surrender.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Surrender to the feeling. Just let it be there, without trying to fix it, figure it out, or solve it with your mind. Each time you notice yourself thinking about the feeling, or anything else, gently bring your attention right back to the sensations in your body. Just breathing and feeling, nothing else to do right now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Keep tuning in, even deeper, right to the center of the feeling in your body. It may move or shift as you do this. If so, simply follow it with your awareness as it changes. Meet the feeling with acceptance, surrender, and even love. This is just a scared, young part of you that doesn’t want discord, upset, hurt, or anger in the world. It just wants everyone to be happy, to love each other. Meet this young, innocent part of yourself with love, acceptance, and gentleness. Give it all the attention and love it needs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you do this, and as you surrender and let go, something powerful begins to happen. You stop fearing other people and their feelings. You may have spent the vast majority of your life running from these feelings of discomfort. You may have orchestrated your entire personality and way of being in the world to minimize their occurrence. This left you feeling stressed, anxious, and guilty about almost every relationship in your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But when you are willing to slow down, and face these feelings inside of yourself head on, their power dissipates. You reclaim your power, and you gain a deep sense of confidence that comes from knowing you can handle any feeling.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my teachers used to say, “feelings are just feelings.” It’s a simple statement that seemed a little stupid-obvious the first time I heard it. But over time I really got what he meant. These terrible, scary, unbearable things that I’m running from–they’re just feelings. They are just uncomfortable or scary sensations in my body that will dissipate, often quite quickly, if I stop resisting them and instead meet them with acceptance, curiosity, and love.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you would like to gain more practice to master this simple technique, go to <span class="CharOverride-15">NotNiceBook.com</span>
 . There you will find an audio recording where I guide you through this process in real time so you can gain practice and confidence using it. I recommend using this audio once per day for twenty days, which will be enough time to help you completely upgrade the way you relate to yourself and your feelings. It will also profoundly shift how responsible you feel for others and increase your own sense of power, ease, and freedom to just be yourself.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Energy Bubble</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This is a simple and effective visualization that can help your subconscious mind let go of taking on so much responsibility for other people’s feelings. You can do this first thing when you wake up in the morning, or as you remember throughout the day.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Imagine a clear bubble all around your body. It surrounds you completely and is about two or three feet away from your skin on all sides. It goes out in front, behind you, to the sides, above your head, and even several feet down into the ground beneath you. It can be completely clear or it can have a slight color to it, whichever color you like: green, blue, pink, red, yellow, or anything that feels right. Mine is typically light green.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment to look around you, imagining this bubble. Seeing it on all sides, becoming more aware of its presence. This is your energy bubble. It stands between you and other people as a semi-permeable membrane. That means it lets in certain things while keeping others out. Other people’s anger, anxiety, judgments and criticisms remain outside the bubble. Love, excitement, and positive connection can pass right through so you can feel it deeply.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This may seem strange to you, or too simple to be of any real impact. But it can be quite powerful. Imagery and symbols communicate directly with our emotional brain in a way that words and language do not. This is one of the reasons why our dreams, which are made up almost entirely of imagery and symbols, are often so dominated by feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I first began using this technique when I was doing face-to-face counseling as a psychotherapist. I noticed that after certain sessions I would be affected by what my client had shared, emotionally wrapped up in the drama of their lives, as if I were the one who was fighting with my partner, breaking up, anxious, or depressed. I wanted to be supportive, yet I needed to take care of myself in order to do effective work and thrive in my own life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Each morning before I began my sessions, I would take several minutes to imagine this bubble. I gave mine a bright, transparent green color that I could see through. I would remind myself that it kept everything out that wasn’t mine, and that taking on other people’s struggles was very different than helping them through theirs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">During sessions, when there was a particularly intense moment or story that a client was sharing with me, I would remind myself of the bubble and let myself imagine it there again in the session. Sometimes, I would imagine clear water cascading down on the outside of the bubble, gently washing the outside and adding another boundary to keep me completely safe.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If I felt myself taking in too much of any emotion that I didn’t need, I would imagine myself gently moving it back outside the bubble with my next exhale, saying in my mind, <span class="CharOverride-9">this is not mine, thank you.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Using this technique doesn’t eliminate compassion or empathy for the people around us. We can still be strongly moved by the joys and sorrows of the people in our lives. It just helps distinguish between being moved by another’s suffering, and taking that suffering on as your own. Seeing the pain and desiring to help alleviate it is compassion. Feeling the pain and becoming angry, sad, anxious, or upset yourself is a sign of taking on something that is not yours.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can experiment with this technique to emotionally release feeling overly responsible for others’ experiences. For example, one of my clients, Olivia, imagined this bubble around herself whenever her mother was angry. Her mother would storm around the kitchen, silently oozing anger and resentment in a way that was hard to ignore. She would occasionally say something to my client in an impatient or harsh tone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Olivia felt responsible for her mother’s anger, even though she intellectually knew that it had nothing to do with her. Regardless, she would instantly react with strong feelings of anxiety, unease, and an impulse to do or say something that would fix it instantly (or just run away).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As she imagined this bubble, she became more able to simply be in the presence of her mother, doing what she needed to do in the kitchen, while feeling more space between them. During one session, she told me that while she was in the kitchen with this energy bubble around her she had this insight, which helped her feel calmer around her mother, even when she was angry: <span class="CharOverride-9">There’s something going on with her, and those are her feelings to deal with, not mine.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Is this energy bubble going to solve all of your problems and bring you instant joy, peace, and happiness forever and ever? Yes. And for the low price of $9,999.99 you can get your very own bubble now!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No, this bubble is not a cure all. But it is a simple and easily doable technique that can powerfully reinforce what you need to remember in situations that matter. Combined with what you are learning in this chapter and in this book, it can help you be freer around others, no matter what is happening around you.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Pattern Interrupt</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One of the biggest challenges with letting go of over-responsibility is that it has become so habitual that it’s automatic. The moment you see someone you work with is upset, your mind instantly interprets it as your fault. Your nervous system responds by shooting out some stress hormones, and gearing your body up to address the danger. This all happens in a heartbeat.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Later that afternoon or evening you might think to yourself: <span class="CharOverride-9">Geez, there I did it again. I got so caught up in worrying about if they were upset with me. Why do I keep doing this?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">First, great job for catching it and noticing this. That is actually a great sign of progress. Secondly, let’s see if we can ditch the frustration with yourself because, contrary to popular belief, getting pissed at yourself doesn’t actually help you learn or grow any faster. Thirdly, you simply need a pattern interrupt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A pattern interrupt is a fancy NLP term for interrupting a pattern or behavior or thought.<span class="Footnotes-1 CharOverride-11">
<span id="footnote-003-backlink">
<a class="_idFootnoteLink _idGenColorInherit" href="text00063.html#footnote-003">4</a>
</span>
</span>
 Whoa. Those guys are clever. Besides, saying, “I’m going to run a pattern interrupt” sounds cooler than saying, “I’m going to interrupt someone’s pattern.” In any case, the key to shifting out of over-responsibility and into personal empowerment is going to involve catching the habitual pattern in the moment and changing it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The best example that comes to mind is one you’ll be very familiar with if you went to school in the United States within the last three to four decades. I’m not sure if they’re still doing this, but when I was a kid, we had extensive training on what to do in case of a fire. Not a big fire drill where you learn the exit route from your classroom into the school quad or parking lot. I mean what to do if <span class="CharOverride-9">you personally are on fire</span>
 . Apparently, if a kid catches on fire, the default pattern is to run around the room screaming, catching all the other kids on fire. So, they needed a pattern interrupt. Do you remember what it was? Three simple words…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Stop…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Drop…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">…and Roll!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I remember doing sing-song practices where we’d call out, “Fire!” then all shout out, “Stop, Drop, and Roll!” as we acted out those behaviors. We did it so many times that to this day, if I were to catch on fire, the first thing that would go through my mind (after, <span class="CharOverride-9">Oh no! I’m on fire!</span>
 ) would be: <span class="CharOverride-9">Aziz! Stop, drop and roll!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To let go of over-responsibility, the first step is to notice the pattern just as it’s happening. Pay close attention to what tends to trigger that feeling of fear, anxiety, or guilt. That urge to make it better, get that person to feel happier, or like you more. Is there a grumpy co-worker that tends to trigger it in you? Is it the days when your boss seems preoccupied or irritable? Is it when your husband uses a certain tone? Take a moment now to think about a few of the major triggers in your current life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The next time these occur, call them out as soon as you can in your mind. At first, you might not catch it until two hours later when you’re driving home. And that’s OK. As time goes by, you’ll get better at catching it right in the moment. Whenever you notice it, the first step is to say something to yourself that shows you caught the pattern. In the spirit of the example above, you could say, “Fire!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Since noticing an old pattern and becoming frustrated with ourselves often go hand in hand, it can be helpful to add a playful element to the discovery. When you catch the old pattern running, you could say to yourself: “Fire!” Then make the sound of an old fire engine “Wheee-ooooh-wheee-ooooh.” If this is silly and absurd and makes you smile or roll your eyes, good! That’s better than being all cranky pants with yourself. We learn much faster when we’re light and playful than when we’re overly serious and irritated.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After catching it, the next step is to insert a new pattern. You can experiment with different options until you find what works best for you, but here are several things that have worked well for me and my clients.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Start by simply taking several conscious breaths. Notice and feel your body as you breathe in, then breathe out. Slow down for just a moment. Then, remind yourself of the truth. You might say something like this to yourself:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am not responsible for their feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We’re all adults here, and responsible for our own feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m responsible for my feelings, they’re responsible for theirs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As they learn to navigate their feelings, they will grow along their path.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I can actually be more supportive and compassionate when I don’t buy into their stories and internalize their issues.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can experiment with the statements above or come up with one that works best for you. The key is to remind yourself of what is actually true. Much like when we first catch on fire, our default pattern when someone is upset is to frantically scream in our minds, “They hate me! We’re all gonna die!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Remember, what really makes someone upset is the perception that they’re not meeting their needs. If you’ve let go, and don’t feel responsible for “fixing” their feelings and making everything instantly better and smooth, then you can consider if there’s something you can do to help them meet their needs. This is coming from a very different place than the approval-seeking pleaser who is scared of the emotions of others. This isn’t coming from fear, it’s coming from a desire to connect, love, and contribute.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">From this place, we can ask ourselves, <span class="CharOverride-9">What might this person need?</span>
 Do they need a sense of certainty or security? If you notice they seem anxious or unsettled, this might be what they need. Are they feeling unappreciated, not good enough, unsure of themselves and their abilities? Perhaps they need some significance. Or maybe they just need some love and connection. Just take your best guess and then experiment with ways that you might help.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, in the case of someone needing certainty, you might provide reassurance: “I can see you’re worried about not getting the project in on time. I know it’s a high-pressure situation. And I also know that you’ve done so much amazing work for this company, and that they need you. Even if you miss this deadline, they’re going to want to keep working with you for a long time.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If someone is needing significance, you can acknowledge or appreciate them for something specific. Give them a compliment for something they did well. Highlight a quality or characteristic in them that is positive, that you admire. Give them praise.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If it’s love and connection, you might lend a listening ear. Hear them out. Empathize with them, and share your own experience so they realize they’re not alone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re not sure what they need, guess what? You can ask them! This sounds so simple, yet I didn’t realize it was a valid option for years. It’s not only valid, it can be the most supportive and effective way to help someone when they are struggling. In a curious and patient tone, ask them, “Do you know what you need right now?” or “What do you think would support you best right now?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are just a few examples of the dozens of ways you can support, help, and contribute to others. <span class="CharOverride-10">Once we’ve let go of taking responsibility for others’ feelings, it frees us up to focus on them and really give them what we can in the moment.</span>
 We’re no longer focused on ourselves, tense and worried about whether they’ll like us or not. We can show up more powerfully, and serve more deeply.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is yet another example of the Not Nice paradox. When we’re trying to be nice, please others, and be a “good person” who everyone likes, we end up becoming way more self-absorbed. We don’t approach the person who’s struggling in an effective or helpful way. We either avoid them because we’re scared, or we come out guns ablazin’, trying to hastily fix their feelings because we can’t tolerate their upset. But when we let all this go, we end up being way more attentive, focused on others, loving, and helpful. We end up being better people by letting go of trying to be “better” people.</p>
