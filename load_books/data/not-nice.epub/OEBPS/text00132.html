<h4 class="Header-02">The 3 Levels of No</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Level 1 - Internal</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In this level, you learn how to determine whether you are a “yes” or a “no” internally. As in, “do I actually want to do this?” This might sound simple, but it actually takes quite a bit of practice. After decades of nice-person programming, we can find it quite difficult to determine what we really want. We might agree to something instantaneously without even pausing to see if we really want to participate. Or, the other person wants it, so we just agree because we don’t want to hurt or offend them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The goal of level one is to slow down and make a practice of checking in with yourself. It’s an extension of the MVP question of this book–what do I want? Because you can’t say no to something if you don’t even know what you want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For the next few weeks, make a practice of checking if you actually want to do something or not. It’s OK if you find out it’s a no, but you’re already along for the ride. That will probably happen a number of times, as you build awareness. Heck, it still happens to me sometimes, even after all this work on being less nice. My wife and I might have made plans during the week to do something during our Sunday afternoon date. Then, when Sunday comes around, and we’re out doing whatever we planned, I’ll notice that I don’t want to be doing it. Why didn’t I mention this at the start of our date so we could change our plans, or at least discuss alternatives? Because I didn’t slow down and ask myself these questions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you make a practice of checking in with yourself, you’ll become more skilled at discovering what your mind, heart, and body really want. Then you can start doing more of level two.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Level 2 - Get It Out</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The next level of no is simply to say no. To get it out of your head and into the world, no matter how it comes out. We all want to be smooth operators who skillfully say no in such a way that everyone is completely pleased, happy, and content. But this requires a lot of practice, and even then is not always possible. Sometimes needs and desires differ and people feel upset. That’s part of being human. Relationships are messy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To practice step two, begin saying no more. I highly recommend setting a goal for yourself. Pick a time frame and a number of noes that you want to say. When I first did this, I decided I would say two noes in one week.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can apply the techniques you’ll learn in a moment so that you are more tactful and graceful, but it’s not always smooth. Often times when we start saying no, we have lots of feelings about it. We feel guilty, or afraid, or have a backlog of resentment from not saying no for years. We feel tense in our bodies, worried about how they’ll respond, and ready for their push back. All this inner turmoil makes smooth execution challenging. And it energetically sends a message to the other person that can bring about more weirdness in their response. They feel our tension and interpret it as shortness or rudeness, for example.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But don’t worry about it. See it as a process and a skill you are developing. Your first noes can be a little rough. When I decided with firm conviction that I would say my two noes, I was working as a resident at the Portland State University counseling center. I had just finished reading a chapter in a book about assertiveness and declared to myself, “That’s it! I’m going to start saying no. Starting right now!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A few seconds later, I opened my office door to head to the bathroom. At the very same moment, my fellow resident and good friend, Banjo, was coming out of his office.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hey, Aziz!” he said, smiling.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hey man,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Can you get to the group early today to set up the room? I know it’s my turn to set up this week, but I have an assessment that’s due tomorrow and I want to try to finish it today,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Uh. Oh, OK,” he said, looking a little confused.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I continued on my way down the hall towards the bathroom, freaking out inside. <span class="CharOverride-9">Good Lord, that was so uncomfortable!</span>
 I didn’t even mind getting to the room early to set it up. I normally would have said yes. I was so set on getting my two noes I just took the opportunity. I had a panicky urge to turn around, run back down the hall to his office and tell him that I’d be happy to set up the room. But I didn’t. I slowed my breathing, calmed my body, and reminded myself that I had a right to say no without justifying or explaining myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It wasn’t smooth and it wasn’t pretty, but I got it out and was well on my way to saying no more freely and easily. Let yourself be messy during this stage. It’s OK. And often times it’s the only way. There’s a lot of fear, guilt, discomfort, and everything else preventing you from casually saying no. The only way to work through all of that is to change your beliefs about niceness, which you’re doing with this book, and then just do it until it becomes relaxed and natural.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Level 3 - Refined Communication</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve practiced the first two levels a number of times, you’ll discover that you can be quite good at saying no. In your core, you’re a natural. We all are. Because saying no is the most natural social interaction in the world. We say yes to what we want and no to what we don’t want. It is only after years of conditioning that we learned this is wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This third level involves saying no in a less guarded, more relaxed way. We are no longer tense or aggressive from feeling scared that we’re doing something wrong. And we’re no longer overly submissive from guilt. Instead, we can simply say no in a calm and loving way when we don’t want to do something. It’s no big deal. It flows out of you like asking for a drink, or for someone to pass the salt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even in instances of higher stakes, such as dating, business, and social situations where people are more emotionally attached, you’ll discover that you can speak clearly and directly, saying no and offering alternatives whenever needed. If the stakes are high for you, of course you may feel nervous or anxious. But your capacity to have all your wits about you and still say what you want to say will still be there. In short, you’ll be a badass.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I want to stress that for virtually all recovering nice people, this comes over time. We want to get there instantly and skip levels one and two–especially level two. That one sucks. But there is no other way to get better at something than to do it messily at first. When we wait to somehow magically leapfrog to level three, we generally take less action and slow down our progress.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Below you are going to learn some smooth-move ninja tactics that naturally emerge when you’re at level three. These can help accelerate your progress and make you better at saying no than most people. Following these tips tends to create less friction and make your experiences more rewarding, so you’ll want to say no again. Still, give yourself time and space. Let yourself swim around in the first few levels for a while. Because the real secret to being at level three is not what you say, it’s being calm and collected in the face of potential upset and friction. And guess how we develop that capacity?</p>
