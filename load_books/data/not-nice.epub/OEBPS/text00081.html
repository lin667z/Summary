<h4 class="Header-02">We All Come Out Different</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">First, we all come out different. As in, out of the womb. Having two children myself, I am amazed at how different they can be, starting at such a young age. This last Christmas we spent time with my wife’s family in her hometown out in the desert in Eastern Washington. At one point, we drove to her grandfather’s house for a short visit. We pulled up to the house, unloaded the crew out of their car seats, and crunched across a thin layer of snow on their lawn to the front door.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we approached, some relative-in-law who I didn’t know opened the door with an excited look on her face.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Candace!” she said energetically.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As they hugged, we all bustled into the door. The house had a great layout with a large living room joined to the kitchen, creating a spacious, open feeling. This was a good thing because there were about thirty people in the house. Kids of all ages, uncles, aunts, grandparents. There was a big TV in the living room blaring a Seattle Seahawks game that was in the fourth quarter. There was a lot going on in there.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Within ten minutes, my three-year son Zaim was in a bedroom of the house, as far away from the noise and chaos as possible. He wanted me to go in there and play with him, away from all the commotion. If someone wanted to talk with him, he’d be hesitant and wary. “I don’t know you,” he’d say to them, before turning away.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After playing with him for a bit in the room, I convinced him to come out with me to get a snack. As we walked into the bustle of the living room, I saw my younger son, Arman (or “Mani” as we call him) surrounded by a circle of adults, kids, and onlookers. He was standing up, waving his arms in the air, then falling back down. He had a huge smile on this face. He was the center of attention and the life of the party, and he loved it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We all just come out differently.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Another key factor I’ve noticed is tolerance. To illustrate this point, I’ll use a fun example we can all relate to. Have you ever lived with a roommate or family member who had a different cleanliness standard than you? Perhaps they had no problem leaving a dish in the sink for a day or two. Or maybe you were the messier one. Either way, let me ask you this. Who did more of the cleaning? That’s right, the one who could tolerate the mess less. Regardless of conversations about the topic, requests, plans, chore grids, or anything else, at the end of the day, the one who hated seeing that nasty dish in the sink would eventually break down and just clean it up. Because they hated seeing it in there. (Guess which one I’d be…)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same is true for conflict. Across the board, when I speak about this topic with clients, they will all tell me how much they hate that feeling of conflict. When someone is upset with them, the sensations it generates in their nervous systems are strong and unpleasant. It’s very hard to just ignore them and go about their day as if nothing were the matter. They have an overwhelming urge to make the feelings go away by “fixing it” and making things right (aka removing the other person’s upset).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While feeling tense and uncomfortable when there is discord between you and others, especially someone close to you, is natural, we all feel it differently. Nice people tend to be more sensitive. We tend to feel things more strongly. We might even hear sounds more loudly, be more sensitive to smells, and our other senses. And we feel our emotions, and the emotions of others more intensely. There is nothing wrong with this, it’s just how we came into this world. Just like there’s nothing wrong with Zaim for wanting to get away from the noise and big energy and go somewhere quiet.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I happen to be very sensitive, which is something I would not admit for a long time. Because, as a man, is being “sensitive” a desirable trait? Absolutely not. At least not in my upbringing. When I was growing up, being sensitive was weak and shameful, and made you worthy of ridicule. So, I learned to hide and deny it. My wife has been extremely helpful in letting me see this in myself, and the beauty and strength in this quality. It helps me be more present and loving with her, my children, and do the work that I do in the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you’re reading this, and reflecting on your own experience, what are you seeing about yourself? Did you hate conflict, tension, or discord in your family? Did you try to stop it and make things better? And, most importantly, are you able to have a bit more understanding and empathy for yourself? Both then, and now?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Because we both know that you’re not stuck in any way. Just because you’ve hated the feeling of tension and avoided conflict in the past, doesn’t mean you’ll never be able to tolerate those feelings and break through. In fact, with all you’ve learned so far in this book, and the tools you’ll discover in this chapter, your capacity to speak up for yourself is going to transform. If, you go easy on yourself. If you’re able to hold yourself with empathy, respect, and compassion. Because if you’re beating yourself up, calling yourself a spineless, overly-sensitive wimp who should “just get over it,” then you won’t make it far. That won’t give you the energy and power you need to expand, take risks, and grow. So, in the spirit of love, self-compassion, and infinite patience for yourself, let’s look at why you don’t speak up now.</p>
