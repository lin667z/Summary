<h4 class="Header-02">The Submissive Stance</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The most common form of conflict avoidance is simply to adopt a submissive stance in our relationships. This tried and true strategy has been used throughout time, and is one that I used for years. It harkens back to our days as pack animals with a clearly defined social hierarchy. Think wolves, or chimpanzees.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In that pack, you have the leaders, or the ones that are vying for “alpha” status. You also have the members of your tier two crew, who are not gunning for the top, but they’re sure to hang on to their position in the pack. Then you have your omega-types. These ones are down at the bottom of the hierarchy, afraid of others, passive, submissive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A number of years back I watched a documentary about this status hierarchy in wolves, lions, and other animal packs. It was fascinating. I remember watching the alpha wolf chasing off the omega from a caribou carcass. The alpha wolf had already eaten, and the tier two wolves were surrounding the fallen beast, eating as much as they could. The poor omega wolf tried to get close and he was chased off, for no reason, other than to communicate: <span class="CharOverride-9">Not yet. You don’t eat until I say you can eat. Got it?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The segment on adolescent lions was even more intense. There was a pack of seven male lions who banded together to hunt, until they grew up enough to meet some lionesses and make stuff happen. At one point, they killed a zebra and were in a tight circle around the animal as they ate. There was just enough space for six of the seven lions. Everyone but the omega. The only place he could get access was the zebra’s head. He sat there timidly licking the hairy scalp, ready to dash off should the alpha, or any other lion in the pack, decide to chase him. As I watched this disturbing display, the narrator said in a calm Australian accent, “in these types of packs, the omega does not often get enough food to eat, and does not survive. Even if he does, he is not a desirable male and will never find a mate.” Harsh.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While these examples might seem extreme and irrelevant to us highly evolved humans, you may be surprised by how much we operate in similar ways. Have you ever been nervous to make eye contact with someone? Have you ever made eye contact and then instantly looked away, without consciously doing it? It was as if some deep instinctual programming forced you to look down, even though you were intending to meet their gaze head on. Guess what? Deep instinctual programming made you do that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We are primates and we are pack animals. In any given social situation, we’re assessing where we fall in the pack hierarchy and behaving accordingly. Based upon appearance, wealth, position in an organization, authority, knowledge, clothing, skill level, and many other criteria, we are determining if we are above or below this person. This happens mostly unconsciously, but is happening nonetheless.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When we’re afraid of conflict, confrontation, or friction of any kind, we automatically adopt the most submissive stance we can. To imagine what that might be, think back to our chimpanzee or wolf friends. The omega wolf does not look at the alpha directly, he keeps his head down, his movements are fast and appear nervous, and his eyes dart from left to right. If another wolf passes him, he steps back, out of his way. If they move towards him directly–if they confront him–what does he do? He rolls onto his side or back and lifts his paws up to expose his belly. The universal gesture of supplication and submission. “Please don’t hurt me.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Chimpanzees will do very similar things. They will also produce a large smile to indicate they mean no harm. “Please, do not hurt me; I am no threat to you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you see any subtle forms of these behaviors in how you interact with others? Do you often avoid eye contact, tending to look away or look down often? If someone speaks their mind firmly and strongly, do you tend to step aside and let them take the floor? Do you hesitate and avoid speaking up in groups? Are you nervous or hesitant in settings where there are authorities, bosses, or the “executive team”? Do you avoid directly approaching women or men that you find attractive?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Perhaps you do the primate smile thing. That one was my bread and butter. I’d smile so much while talking with people. I’d also be quick to laugh at anything they said. And my laugh would be a bit too hard, too much, too forced. We often smile and laugh to send the social signal: <span class="CharOverride-9">I like you. Please like me.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Another submissive stance favorite that seems to be unique to humans is the heavy use of apologies. We can say “I’m sorry” so frequently, and for so many different things, it just becomes a habit. We end up apologizing hastily if we bump shoulders on the train, both grab the door handle at the same time, start to speak up at the same time, and so many other instances that don’t actually warrant an apology. We may consider it “politeness,” but it is actually rooted in submissiveness and conflict avoidance. Don’t worry, I have a fun game in store for you in Chapter 12 that will help you end over-apologizing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For now, can you see how you’re moving through life, adopting a submissive stance everywhere you go? Or for you it might not be everywhere, just in certain situations at work or in your romantic life. When I really got just how much I was doing this, how much it pervaded every social interaction I had, I was shocked. And I decided I needed to do something about it fast.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The good news is changing your stance towards others is relatively easy. It does require awareness, effort, and leaning into the edge of your comfort zone. That’s exactly what you’re here to learn how to do. Sure, it can be uncomfortable at first, but compared to our wolf and lion friends, we have it easy. I don’t think the omegas in those packs could simply choose to show up differently. Their pack structure is in large part based on physical strength. If that omega wolf decided one day that he wasn’t going to take it, and approached the alpha directly, he’d be beat down hard.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, our hierarchies are much more abstract and malleable. In fact, as soon as you stop buying into a given metric of status, you’ve broken free. For example, if you truly did not care about how much money someone had, you would walk into a room full of billionaires and interact freely and confidently. You could start conversations, make jokes, and just be yourself. If, on the other hand, you were locked into the cultural mindset that your net worth equals your human worth, then it would be a different story. You’d be nervous about entering that room, you’d be hesitant to approach people, join into groups, and engage others for fear of them looking down upon you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In just a few short chapters, you’ll be learning exactly how to end this insanity, so you can boldly be yourself around anyone, no matter how wealthy, accomplished, or beautiful. We’ll also help you eliminate the submissive stance so you show up as your full, powerful self–the real you–not some inhibited, timid, limited version of yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To clarify, I’m not saying that smiling, laughing, choosing not to share your opinion, or apologizing are weak things that only a “timid loser” would do. Each of these is an important part of connecting with others and necessary at times. The difference is when and how we do them. If they become habitual, excessive, and compulsive from a fear of conflict or a need for approval, then they backfire as social connectors. They reduce our confidence and push others way. We must change these habits.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Over-Accommodating</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">To accommodate means to “fit with the wishes or needs of.” Therefore, accommodating another person may involve doing something that fits their wishes or needs. Sounds pretty good, right? Do things for others. Help them get what they want. Do what they want you to do. Then they’ll be pleased, feel happy, and like being with you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is actually a recipe for a good relationship that is based on both people bringing value to the other person’s life. It’s the basis of friendship, business partnerships, customer/client relationships, and romantic relationships. And… it goes too far.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When our primary objectives are to avoid disapproval, disagreement, friction, or any sort of conflict, we tend to veer too far into what can be called over-accommodating. This means giving too much of yourself, doing too much of what other people want, and not paying attention to what you want and need.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Someone asks for something, you say yes. Someone needs help, you’re there. Someone needs a ride? Sure. Someone needs you to stay longer. No problem. And on and on it goes. When you’re over-accommodating, your habitual response to requests is yes, without hesitation, and without negotiation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You also don’t want to bother people by making requests of them. You know they are busy and have a lot on their plate, so you only ask if it’s extremely important. Otherwise, you just try to figure it out and manage on your own, so as to not be a burden to others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This combination of saying yes to everything, and not asking directly for what you want, leads to feeling overcommitted and overwhelmed. You feel stressed and anxious much of the time, trying to meet the demands of everyone. But the idea of saying no to someone is even scarier than the chronic anxiety of trying to accommodate everyone, so you stick with that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yet, even though you’re doing everything for everyone, you may have the nagging suspicion that others don’t really appreciate you. At least, they don’t seem to. In fact, they seem to treat you with less respect, as if you owe them something.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The whole thing feels terrible, but what are you going to do? Start saying no? Become some kind of selfish asshole who doesn’t care about others? No, that won’t work. Everyone would hate you and you’d lose your family, friends, and job. The only thing to do is to try harder, be nicer, and put a smile on your face.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Can you relate to this insanity? It’s how I lived for years. I felt completely trapped by my need to accommodate others. To consider doing something else brought on strong waves of fear and guilt. If you see yourself in this pattern, I’m so glad you’re reading this book. Things can become so much better!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In Part II you will learn how to break this pattern of over-accommodating and instead have healthy boundaries, say no when you need to, and ask for what you want without guilt. Before we dive into those steps, there is just one more thing we must address–what being so nice is really costing you.</p>
