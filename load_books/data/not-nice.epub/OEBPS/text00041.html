<h4 class="Header-02">4. Powerlessness</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">Another specter than haunts you when you’re nice is a feeling of powerlessness. This makes sense, because you are. At least as long as you’re living by the self-imposed rules of the nice person.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Living by these rules, you must put others first, be extremely accommodating, only do what others want, only express the parts of you that others will like, avoid speaking your mind, and be quiet and polite. These rules are robbing you of your power and force.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As a result, you don’t feel like you have much impact or influence in the world. Other people are promoted ahead of you, other people are chosen for opportunities, and other people get dates and find love. You are waiting on the sidelines, being nice, and playing by the rules.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we do this, we have the unspoken expectation that goes something like this. If I’m nice and play by all these rules, then life will bring me good things. People will like me, respect me, hire me, promote me, date me, love me, and be my friend.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The problem is this plan doesn’t work. It doesn’t bring you the things you really want. The nice stance is inherently a passive one. It’s the path of avoidance of discomfort and hoping that life will magically turn out the way we want it to. It’s a life of fear with a thin rationalization: <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m choosing to live this way because it makes me a “good person.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To challenge those rules and change how you are in the world can stir up anxiety and guilt. I can’t become “one of those people.” Those selfish jerks and assholes who just take what they want from others and from life. And so we decide to stick to the same game, but just play it harder. Be nicer, more pleasing, more accommodating, more giving, and more polite. Eventually, this will all pay off. Eventually my time will come.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This disconnection from our power removes our personal agency, our sense of “I can make things happen.” When this is gone, we fall into a victim stance towards life. As I talk about in my book, <span class="CharOverride-9">The Art of Extraordinary Confidence</span>
 , the victim stance severely limits our capacity in life and destroys our confidence. It leads to a phenomenon called learned helplessness, where we train ourselves to see things as out of reach or impossible, so we don’t even try.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I want closer friends, I want a girlfriend, I want a husband, I want a better job, I want to start my own business, I want to feel more comfortable around others, and I want to date more easily. All of these desires are things we wish for and hope for, but don’t actually make a reality. Because we’ve bought into the excuses and stories that tell us it’s too hard, too scary, too uncomfortable. We tell ourselves self-defeating stories, such as: <span class="CharOverride-9">I just can’t do that, I’m not good enough at talking with people</span>
 , or my personal favorite, the vague, <span class="CharOverride-9">there’s something wrong with me.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">All of this is nonsense. They are excuses and stories we generate to keep us from having to face our fears and take action. The nicer we are, the more powerless we feel, and the more trapped we become in this land of hesitation, self-doubt, and inaction.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In what areas of your life do you feel powerless? Where are you wishing things would be different, but you don’t really believe they can be?</p>
