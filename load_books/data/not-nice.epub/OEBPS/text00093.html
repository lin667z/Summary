<h4 class="Header-02">Ask Questions</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One of the simplest and easiest ways to begin speaking up more frequently is to start engaging in meetings and other settings. Instead of being completely passive and virtually invisible, you want to insert yourself and make your presence known. The simplest way to ease into this process is through asking questions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These can be any kinds of questions, and it depends on your unique business and setting. Questions about the plan, about someone’s thinking, about their reasoning, about how a project might unfold.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At first people sometimes fear this will make them look under qualified or incompetent. This is usually just a fear of speaking up and an excuse we use so we don’t have to do it. But you can also make sure your questions are relevant and bring value to the discussion. Let me give you an example to illustrate.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my clients works in the tech field, and avoided speaking up in meetings for years. Now, if he asked questions like, “How do search terms work?” or, “What are the top search engines?” his peers would think he’d lost his mind. These are questions I, or another layman, might ask. They’re not the refined questions of someone who’s been working in the field for years.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here are some of the questions he might ask:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“If we did do approach A, how long will it take to collect enough data to analyze?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why do you want to use approach A over approach B or C?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“When will you have project X completed by?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“It’s unclear to me how all the pieces fit together here. How does this integrate with that?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Who does that sound like to you? The boss. Or at least whoever is running the meeting. And yet, you can do this regardless of your official position. Depending on your role in the meeting you might not be asking a dozen of these questions and directing the whole thing, but you can certainly get one or two in per meeting. This habit engages you, makes your presence known, adds to the discussion, and is a sign of contribution and leadership.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes people have a fear about asking even these kinds of questions. They imagine that any question at all will make others think they are stupid or foolish. They feel a pressure to know everything right away.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One client I spoke with worked in the legal field and was afraid to approach her boss with questions. She imagined he would say, “just look it up yourself. You should know that already.” I asked a few questions and discovered her boss had never actually said anything like this, so it was clear this was a projection of her own judgments. It was just fear. So, we did a little role play where she played that boss, and I demonstrated how she might respond:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Me: (Insert specific and intelligent sounding legal question here)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Boss-Man: You don’t know that? You should by now. Just look it up yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Me: OK, I could do that. You seem bothered by me asking you, so I’m curious about your stance on questions in general. Do you not want me to ask you and get the answer quickly? Would you prefer I take more time to look it up?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I asked my client what she noticed about my response, she said, “You spoke to him just like a regular person. You were trying to figure out what he wanted. And you also highlighted that it would take more time to do it the other way. You weren’t apologetic about not knowing.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That last point is the key for asking questions and has been my secret to rapid growth, learning, and success. A long time ago I simply decided I would no longer hold a question back. I would no longer tell myself I “should know something and shouldn’t ask.” I gave myself complete permission to ask anything. Once you let go of this self-absorbed fear of: <span class="CharOverride-9">Do I look smart enough? Me! Me! ME! Everyone is focused on and constantly thinking about ME!</span>
 and start connecting with others, you realize that people almost always answer questions. No judgments, no berating you, no drama.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If someone says what kind of work they do, and I don’t know what that really is, I will say that and ask them to tell me more. If I’ve forgotten someone’s name, even though I’ve met them several times before, I will say, “So… I have a confession to make...” then pause for a moment as if it’s something really dramatic, “I’ve forgotten your name!” Then they laugh and tell me their name, and we move on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Basically, you have a choice. You can live the rest of your life trying to appear like you know more than you do in an (ineffective) attempt to impress others or maintain their approval of you. Or you can acknowledge you’re a human who doesn’t know everything, who shouldn’t know everything, who’ll never know everything, and who learns most rapidly by asking questions. I personally like option B, how about you?</p>
