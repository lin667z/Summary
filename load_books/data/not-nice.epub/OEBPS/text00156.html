<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In order to let go of trying to be someone else, and to boldly be yourself without apology, you must become the authority in your own life. This is a subtle shift away from looking to others to tell us what to do, what to say, how to be, and to look inward and trust our own guidance, our own decisions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This can be scary at first. We often look to others because we don’t feel like the authority. We are unsure, we don’t know enough yet, we don’t know how, and we’re afraid of doing it wrong and messing things up. When we turn to someone else as the authority, and they seem certain about what they’re saying, it can be very relieving. <span class="CharOverride-9">Ah, they have the answers; I’ll just do what they say. Whew!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This can be beneficial at first. If you keep having the same fight with your partner, and you two always get stuck, it can be helpful to get some outside input. Maybe you consult with a couple’s counselor, or read a book about how to communicate better with each other.<span class="Footnotes-1 CharOverride-11">

 If you apply what you learn, your communication can improve and your relationship gets better. Huzzah!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same goes for learning about how to build a business, get in better shape, improve your mood, or learn a new skill. Learning from others, modeling, and finding new approaches and solutions is the fast track to rapid growth, and success.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, learning from others involves trusting in others and seeing them as an authority on the subject. And that can slowly lead to trusting others as a <span class="CharOverride-9">higher</span>
 authority than yourself in your own life. That’s where it becomes a problem. That’s where you lose connection with yourself and lose your power.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, we must reclaim our power and our sense of internal authority. We may consider what we have learned and weigh what different teachers might suggest, and then decide for ourselves what the best course of action is. Then stand in that decision firmly, clearly, and confidently. As in: I said it, I meant it. That just happened.</p>
