<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">- Audible Review for <span class="CharOverride-9">The Solution to Social Anxiety</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">At the time I’m writing this, there are 7.4 billion humans on this planet. And that number just keeps going up. Barring massive calamity or world order collapse, estimates for the year 2100 range from 11 to 14 billion people. That’s a whole heck of a lot.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We hear numbers in the billions, and even trillions, quite a bit these days, as it relates to national spending and budgets. But few people actually grasp how large these numbers really are. If you were to take a single US dollar bill and lay it on the ground, it will measure just under 6 inches. If you laid out 100 bills just like that, end to end, it would be 614 inches or about 51 feet (or 15.5 meters for my international friends). So far so good. Do you know how long 1,000,000,000 (one billion) dollar bills would be? Take a guess now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">96,900 miles (about 156,000 kilometers). This would be enough to wrap around the entire earth almost four times. A billion is a huge amount.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There are 7 billion of us humans running around. The vast, vast majority of these people will never even know of you and your existence. If 500 people know you, which is a lot of people if you think about it, that means you’re interacting directly with.00005% of the humans on the planet. If you do something that brings more attention to yourself, such as writing a successful book or being in the media, that number may be slightly higher. In any case, the majority of humanity doesn’t know about you, and doesn’t really care.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And when it comes to the people you do know and interact with, how much control do you really have over what makes them like you? It’s way less than we’d like to admit.</p>
