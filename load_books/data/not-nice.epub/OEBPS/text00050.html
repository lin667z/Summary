<h4 class="Header-02">Your Rights</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Let’s make a list of those rights now. Drawing from the kinds of things you’d like to be able to do in the world, ask yourself: What are my rights? What am I allowed to do? What am I entitled to?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you ask yourself these questions, don’t look at the past. Don’t look to what mom or dad said was OK, or how you “should” be. Look inward, to your own heart, and tune into your own intuition. Look forward to the kind of person you want to be, the kind of person you’re destined to be. Imagine the most free, bold, happy, successful, authentic, and powerful version of you. What rights does he or she have?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Below are some of mine. As you read this list, see which ones stand out to you. You are free to adopt any that resonate. You may also notice some push your buttons, or seem offensive or somehow “wrong”. That’s OK too. You might find that ultimately those are not going to be in your bill of rights. Or, you may find that you secretly wish you too could have that right, but there is still too much nice-person programming that is blocking you from fully allowing it. If that’s the case, that should be resolved by the time you reach the end of this book.</p>
