<h3 class="Header-01">Five Levels of Comm<a id="_idTextAnchor022"></a>
 itment</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The five levels of commitment are a way to assess how committed you are to any process. They are described quite well by Dr. Robert Wubbolding, who is a pioneer of Reality Therapy, along with William Glasser.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Level 1: Lack of Commitment</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Strong resistance characterizes this level and statements like: I don’t really want to do anything different. I like ____ (smoking, drinking, pleasing others, etc.).</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Level 2: Outcome without Effort</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This level is full of wish, hope, and fantasy. I want to lose weight and get in great shape. I want to be able to walk up to any attractive stranger and just casually start talking to them. I want to start my own business, get a promotion, or make X amount of money (insert large number here).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We do want all these things, but we don’t want to make the effort. We don’t want to take action consistently over time. We don’t want to do any work at all for the outcome. We just want it now, quickly and easily. This level is characterized by a lack of any significant action. Instead, we have numerous reasons as to why we can’t get what we want, because either the outside world is preventing us (excuses), or we are not capable to make it happen (stories).</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Level 3: Trying</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This level of commitment indicates we’re actually willing to do something. We’re willing to try things, take action, and begin to take steps in the world to create the outcomes we want. However, as I say in <span class="CharOverride-9">The Art of Extraordinary Confidence</span>
 , trying is weak. It means we will take action until we hit something difficult or challenging, and then we’ll quit.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This level is characterized by phrases like, “I’ll try,” “Maybe,” and “Probably.” We might say, “Ok, this week I’ll try to start conversations with some people at that networking event,” or “I’ll probably approach some women at the party. Maybe, if I feel like it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Underneath this language is this mentality: <span class="CharOverride-9">I’ll do just enough to get by</span>
 . I see this level of commitment all the time in clients. If they’re uncomfortable speaking up in meetings, they’ll think: <span class="CharOverride-9">Ok, I’ll work on this confident speaking up thing just enough to get a little better at it, to not be completely silent. That’s good enough.</span>
 Or, if someone wants to work out, they think: <span class="CharOverride-9">what’s the minimum I have to work out per week to get into ok shape?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The bare-minimum-to-get-by standard is the calling card of the dabbler and never leads to mastery. It also rarely leads to great outcomes, consistent results, wealth, love, or happiness. By rarely, I mean never.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Level 4: Do My Best</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This level is where things really start to heat up. This is when we start to take consistent action, face our challenges head on, and step up in life. This is where we start to notice progress and results, which feels good. This might even seem like the top level of commitment; however, it still leaves the door open for giving up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We may put our all into something for weeks or even months. We put in effort, energy, time, money, and our motivation and intention. We do our best. However, we still aren’t getting the results we want. When this happens, many people will say, “Well, I did my best. I guess I’m just not meant to get X or achieve Y.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This of course is false, but it does make a plausible story. We now can quit, stop putting in the effort, and go back towards the safety of our comfort zone. We may even feel good about how hard we tried, and how we “gave it our all.” However, little do we know that we are actually worse off than before. Now, back in the safety of the center of our comfort zone, we also have this poisonous belief: <span class="CharOverride-9">I did my best and I couldn’t get the result. That means I never will.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s why you need to step up to level five.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Level 5: Whatever It Takes</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This level of commitment leads to results. Period. This was my level of commitment many years ago when I decided I was going to turn off my video game and start looking for solutions on how to become more confident approaching women and dating. It’s the level of commitment you’ve made on any major endeavor that you’ve stuck with and succeeded. Anything that required effort over time, required this level from you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The reason this level is so powerful is that it cuts off all exit routes. There is no escape. If I don’t know something, I’ll need to learn it. If I’m scared to do something, I’ll need to face it and overcome it. If I believe I can’t, then I must.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This level is so powerful because it shows us repeatedly that our mind’s predictions about what is possible for us are completely arbitrary and usually wrong. We stop believing in the predictions of our Safety Police and start getting into more and more action, faster and faster. Moreover, that’s when we achieve incredible breakthroughs in short periods.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, when it comes to shedding the unhelpful elements of your nice person patterns, how committed are you? What is your level of commitment to take consistent action to break free and live as your most powerful, expressive, authentic self?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Really, take a moment to slow down, breath, and check in with yourself. Don’t just instantly say “Five!” and keep reading. See where you actually are. Are you going to “try this out a little and see if it works right away”? (Level 3) Are you secretly hoping that you’ll find the magic bullet in a chapter later in this book and it will instantly remove all discomfort and fear forever? (Level 2) Or are you willing to step up, face fear and discomfort, do new things, and experiment with being in the world in different ways until you truly discover who you really are? Are you willing to do whatever it takes?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In any area of life, dabbling will get you very little. In case you aren’t familiar with the term, dabbling is when you try a little, then quit when it gets difficult or uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We all dabble in something. I’ve dabbled at learning Spanish. I get a book, get excited, and dive in... until chapter three. I buy a course like The Rosetta Stone, and practice it passionately... for four days.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And guess what? I don’t speak Spanish. I never will. Not unless I decide, deep down, that I am going to speak Spanish. That I must do it. Then, I’d be on the path of mastery and it would only be a matter of time until I became fluent.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same goes for shedding nice conditioning and stepping into your authentic, powerful, loving, and successful self. Reading a few chapters will get you virtually nothing. Maybe some excitement, hope, or insight. But nothing will truly change, or profoundly transform, unless you decide you are going to do this. To commit to this. To master it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment right now and ask yourself, “Am I going to dabble or decide?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Am I going to read a few chapters, feeling the excitement of promise and the sparkle of possibility that a new book brings?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or am I going to dive in fully, go deep, and <span class="CharOverride-9">use this book to transform</span>
 how I show up in the world? Am I going to read it, study it, underline it, do the activities and exercises inside it, and keep returning to it until the job is done?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment now to ask yourself these questions. The answers you come up with determine the course of the rest of your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, take a few minutes to write out a list of all the ways that being too nice is holding you back in your life. What is it costing you? What has it caused you to miss? What pain does it force you to live in on a daily basis?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then consider the flip side. Write out what it would be like to be free of all this. What would your life be like if you weren’t afraid of other’s opinions? What if you could freely be yourself without worry about what they would think? What if you could say no when you needed to without guilt or fear? What if you could ask for what you wanted, and receive it much of the time? What if you could handle confrontations with calm and bold assertion? How would all this feel? What would this powerful version of you be able to create in your life? What kind of relationships, business, or personal success could it bring?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take some time to consider the cost of nice and the benefits of being more powerfully yourself. Write them down and focus on them. This will allow you to get leverage on yourself, so you’re fully committed to do whatever it takes to break free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re in, continue on to the next chapter, and dive into Part II of this book. You will find a wealth of insights, activities, and strategies that will guide you to achieving your freedom.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If not, I’d suggest re-reading the first part of this book, especially this chapter about the costs of nice. Honestly take in just how limited your life is, how anxious or depressed you really feel on a daily basis, and how powerless and hopeless you feel about your love life, friendships, or career. Let yourself feel the pain and discomfort of it all until it reaches a breaking point. Until you get so fed up that you decide with force and conviction, “That’s it. Forget this. I’m done living this way. I’m ready. I’m ready to do whatever it takes.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then your life will never be the same again…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’re clear in yourself, take it one step further. Find a friend, your spouse, or someone in your family who is supportive of you growing and becoming the best version of yourself. Don’t go to Uncle Frank, who spends all day watching TV and thinks personal growth “is for wimps who need to man up and see that life is tough and then you die.” Find someone who is on the same page, and share your commitment with them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Share what you are learning in this book, and how niceness is causing pain and holding you back. Share your vision for how you want to be in the world, and who you want to be. This act of sharing with someone close to you is significant. Once it is spoken and known, it becomes real. It sets things in motion inside of you that are not even visible until months or years later. It’s powerful, and it’s worth it. After all, you’re willing to do whatever it takes, remember?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Thank you. Thank you for your courage, your honesty with yourself, and your desire for freedom. I honor and respect you for it, and I see you as a brother or sister on the same path. I love you, and I am so excited to share the way out with you now.</p>
