<h3 class="Header-01">What D<a id="_idTextAnchor030"></a>
 o I Perceive?</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Right up there with knowing what you want is knowing what you think, believe, and perceive. When our boundaries are weak, we tend to have a very shaky hold on these sorts of things. We automatically look to others to determine what our thoughts and opinions might be. We look to others to determine our reality for us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may experience this as a lack of certainty in your perceptions and convictions. You may not have a strong opinion on much of anything. You also might feel quite a bit of self-doubt about what you say, whether it’s right, or if others agree with you. In fact, you might even pride yourself on this. I know I did for years.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would tell myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m just a more flexible and open-minded person. People’s opinions and beliefs are all based on their ego’s need to be right anyway. I just don’t buy into that as much.</span>
 Never underestimate our ability to make ourselves feel better than others when we unconsciously feel inferior and insignificant.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While some of this is true–I am a very curious and open-minded person and don’t tend to lock into debate battles with people about their opinions–I also didn’t have a strong sense of myself. I didn’t value what I thought or perceived in that moment. I assumed others’ opinions were more intelligent, better researched, and more valid than my own.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Part of having solid boundaries, and being less of a nice person involves owning your perspective. Valuing it, acknowledging it, and being willing and able to share it. It doesn’t matter if someone in the company has been there longer than you, or that person has read more articles on the subject than you. That doesn’t mean you don’t have insight, ideas, or a unique and valuable perspective.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The first step to boldly and confidently share your perspectives in any setting begins internally. If you have a negative habit of valuing other opinions too highly, and as more valid than your own, then you’ll never really be sure of what you think in a given situation. It leaves you feeling confused and unable to express yourself, limiting your happiness and impact in the world. Imagine if Martin Luther King didn’t stand up as a leader of the civil rights movement because he didn’t trust his own perception that oppression was unacceptable. What if Tony Robbins stayed working as a janitor because he didn’t think his ideas mattered?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s time to interrupt any nice-person habits that keep you from owning your perspective. Stop hypnotizing yourself with the story that you don’t know enough about the subject, or that other people are smarter and you should just agree with them and keep silent. Uncovering what you think about a situation is the first step in being able to assert yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Start looking inward in all settings–at work, in meetings, while speaking with your boss, with your spouse, your friends, and your parents. Ask yourself, “What do I think about this? What’s my opinion? What’s my perspective? How do I see the situation?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You don’t have to even voice this at first. You just have to assess where you stand internally. Notice if you agree with what someone is saying, or disagree. If you disagree internally, don’t immediately push that away with rationalizing and telling yourself to be more flexible and open-minded. Instead, honor that difference. Let yourself think: <span class="CharOverride-9">Hmm, I don’t know about that.</span>
 Again, for now, you don’t need to worry about speaking up, what to say, and how to disagree in conversations. We’ll cover all of that in Chapter 9.</p>
