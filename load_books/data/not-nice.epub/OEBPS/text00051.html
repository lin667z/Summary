<h4 class="Header-02">My Rights:</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to approach anyone I want to start a conversation with.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to change the subject or end the conversation whenever I would like.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to insert myself into a conversation and interrupt someone who’s speaking.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to say “no” to anything I don’t want to do, for any reason, without needing to justify it or give an excuse.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to ask for what I want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to ask why and negotiate if someone initially says “no.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to offer anything to anyone, any number of times (and they have the right to say no).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to change my mind; I do not always need to be logical and consistent.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to ask questions whenever I’d like to know something.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to disagree with others (even if they know more about the subject than I do).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to share my perspective, even if someone might disagree or temporarily be uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to make mistakes, mess up, or otherwise not be perfect.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to not be responsible for others, including their feelings and problems.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to take time and space to be by myself, even if others would prefer my company.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right not to have to anticipate others’ needs and wishes. If they have them, they can express them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to say yes to having sex, to enjoy sex, and to pause during sex to have a conversation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to be treated with respect.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to expect honesty and integrity from others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to feel all of my feelings, including anger, grief, sadness, and fear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to feel grief about something for as long as that grief persists.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to feel something or do something without needing to justify myself to others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to feel angry at those I love, and to express it in a responsible manner.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to express my feelings assertively while respecting others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I have the right to choose how much I want to see a friend or someone I’m dating, and end the relationship if it does not feel desirable to me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There you have it. My bill of rights. How does it feel to read? Empowering? Edgy? I can tell you this, writing it feels good. As I wrote, I was smiling, my head was nodding, and I could almost hear it as a sermon some impassioned Southern Baptist preacher might make.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s create your bill of rights now. You can use as many as you like from my list, exactly as they are, or tweak them slightly to fit your wording and preferences. You can also add as many more as you like. Let yourself get into the creation of this list. Let it be liberating and fun. Ready? Begin.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">---</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Welcome back, and well done. This is something that the vast majority of people will never consciously think about. They’ll never take the time, energy, and focus to map out their own personal rights like you just did. This is a big step towards freeing yourself from your old nice programming and living life on your terms.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I suggest you print your bill of rights and have it somewhere that you can see often. The more you can keep this list in your conscious awareness, the more it will influence you now. This list is your guiding force. Read it before you go to work in the morning. Read it before you have an intimidating meeting or presentation. Read it before you go out with friends or on a date. Read it before you spend time at the family gathering or go visit your parents for a weekend. Read it whenever you need to remind yourself of what you are allowed to do, regardless of what you were taught growing up. This will keep your guidance coming from within, from your values, which makes you a much stronger, self-directed leader in your own life.</p>
