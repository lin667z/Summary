<h4 class="Header-02">Disarm</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Knowing that you can disarm someone who is upset with you is one of the most valuable skills in the world. I learned a great deal about this technique, and the acceptance paradox, from one of my teachers, Dr. David Burns. If you want to go deeper with these, I highly recommend his books, including <span class="CharOverride-9">Feeling Good, Intimate Connections</span>
 , and <span class="CharOverride-9">When Panic Attacks</span>
 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There are two elements to disarming someone who’s upset: empathy and agreeing with them. Now before you cringe at how nice this sounds, hear me out. It actually allows you to connect with them without taking responsibility for their feelings, saying things you don’t mean, or letting them walk all over you just to make the problem go away. This is different from being nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">First, when someone is upset, they want to be heard. They want to be seen, acknowledged, and validated. They don’t want to be argued with, told they’re stupid or wrong, or ignored. Unfortunately, out of fear of conflict, this is often exactly what we do. Even when we’re trying to be nice. Let me demonstrate with an example.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s say your spouse’s parents are in town for the weekend. You plan on hosting them, taking them out to dinner, and otherwise being a great son or daughter-in-law. At the same time, you have an opportunity to spend some time with your friends on Saturday, which you decided to do. Your spouse has feelings about this. Perhaps they come out immediately. Or perhaps it starts with some huffy sounds and a lack of eye contact. Maybe their responses are a little terse, or they ask you why you bought so many damn green crackers that are clogging up the pantry. (That one is totally hypothetical. I’ve never done that.)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You notice the clues, so you ask your partner how they’re doing, and if they’re upset about something. Then this comes out:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Them</span>
 : I’m sad about you not being with us today. I feel hurt that you’d rather spend time with your friends than be with me and Mom and Dad. It’s so rare that they come into town.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : SHUT UP! <span class="CharOverride-9">(run crying out of the kitchen)</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No, that’s probably unlikely. But, the impulse here is to defend yourself, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : It’s only for this afternoon. We went out to dinner last night and then I’ll be spending the day with everyone on Sunday.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This response seems perfectly reasonable, and it is. But it doesn’t actually do anything to handle the underlying feelings. If anything, it will intensify the other person’s upset, because they won’t feel heard, acknowledged, or validated. Thus, they might come back with more intensity to convey their point, which in turn creates more defensiveness. Then the rest of the weekend sucks for everybody.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, you can disarm them. This involves simply acknowledging what they are feeling, and then finding the grain of truth in what they are saying. Your spouse in this example is actually doing a great job of specifically voicing their feelings. Sometimes people don’t actually do this, and instead they speak in code. You have to infer what their underlying feelings are. Once you do, you simply acknowledge that they’re feeling that way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Them</span>
 : I’m sad about you not being with us today. I feel hurt that you’d rather spend time with your friends than be with me and Mom and Dad. It’s so rare that they come into town.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : I’m sorry you’re feeling sad, sweetie. I get it. You were hoping that we’d all spend the afternoon together, and you’re feeling hurt that I’m choosing to spend time with Landon and Ben. It feels like I’m choosing them over you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s it. No apology, no defense. Just a simple reflection of what they must be feeling like, described with empathy and love. You know you’re doing it right when as soon as you finish speaking, the other person wants to share more. “Yes! And…” That’s a good sign. If your tone is dismissive or subtly mocking them for having so many feelings, then it won’t work very well, and they’ll most likely shut down, or defend their feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The key here is to really empathize with their situation. This only becomes possible when you’re not overwhelmed with guilt and pain every time you act in your own healthy self-interest. If you haven’t worked through that, then it will be almost impossible to not defend yourself, because on some level you feel shame and as if you’ve done something wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Another element of disarming someone is to find something to agree with in what they’re saying.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : I know Mom and Dad come into town only once in a while; it’s true.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : I get it. I imagine I would feel upset if it were the other way around. I’d want you to want nothing more than to just spend the entire day with us. It’s so much more fun when you’re there.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you combine this kind of agreement with empathy, you will rapidly resolve conflict. Typically, upset people just want to be seen and heard, and if you can do so, their upset will often pass quickly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, it’s possible to go deeper and explore what’s really going on. Not to defend yourself, but to get closer to your spouse, and have them gain self-awareness. Why are they so upset about you taking some time for yourself? Do they have any feelings about their parents visiting? This can often stimulate a lot of feelings in people, ranging from longing for a connection they never quite get, to memories from childhood, to sadness about the awareness of their parents’ eventual death. There’s so much you two could be talking about and using to share a deep connection.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This technique is so powerful because it gives you a tool to handle conflict when it arises. Take a moment to think about someone in your life that you sometimes fear might be upset with you. It could be a specific person, such as your supervisor or spouse, or a category of people, such as clients or employees. Regardless, take a moment to think about who would make you most anxious if they were upset. Instead of briefly touching on the fear, and then scrambling to make sure it never happens, slow down. Breathe. Move towards the fear instead of avoiding it. Lean into the discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are you afraid they would be upset with you about? Be as specific as possible. What would they say? What are they <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 thinking, but would never say? Then write it out and actually have a dialogue with them on paper. Go back and forth, in the dialogue, approaching that imaginary upset person with empathy and curiosity.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">The Acceptance Paradox</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The most powerful way to handle any upset or criticism is to simply accept a piece of it as true. This is often the last thing we want to do because when someone is upset they might be stating or implying that we’re bad, hurtful, selfish, or otherwise no good. Even if they don’t think this, we might start to feel that way, and then need to defend ourselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And yet, if we can agree with some aspect of the criticism, without agreeing that we’re a bad person, we neutralize the conflict and boost our self-esteem. We acknowledge that we’re human, and let go of the need to be perfect. As humans, sometimes we say the wrong thing, are insensitive, focus too much on ourselves, harbor angry or resentful thoughts, and so much more. It’s a huge relief when we can stop pretending that none of that is happening.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To gain skill with this technique, I recommend you write out some of the criticisms you fear. Then, practice simply accepting a piece of each one. Let me demonstrate. Here are a few criticisms that come to my mind. The first three I’ve received from others. The last one has come solely from my own inner critic.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Criticism: You don’t really care about helping people. You are greedy and just want to take their money. <span class="CharOverride-9">(I get this one about once per month, usually from someone I’ve never met via email).</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Response: It’s true, sometimes I don’t care about helping people. Sometimes I’m focused on myself and not really thinking about all the people in the world who are suffering in different ways and need help.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Criticism: Your <span class="CharOverride-9">YouTube</span>
 videos are too focused on helping men, you don’t care about women.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Response: Yeah, a lot of my videos, especially my early ones, were geared specifically towards men. I didn’t directly address women in those videos.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Criticism: Your books are total garbage. Long-winded, no value in them at all.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Response: Ha, they definitely are long! I have a lot to share. My books are not for everybody. Some people really don’t like them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Criticism: Your clients don’t actually improve. You don’t really help anybody. You suck as a coach.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Response: I have had clients who didn’t make that much progress. That has happened.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even in doing this exercise, my impulse here is to defend myself. And, to be clear, that’s not necessarily a bad thing. But if we can embrace the acceptance paradox and not need to clarify, justify, or make ourselves look better immediately, we gain a tremendous freedom.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Because even though we’re afraid of these criticisms coming from the outside, what we’re</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-18">really</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-10">afraid of is these criticisms coming from the</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-18">inside</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-10">.</span>
 It’s our own critic that we’re most scared of.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The only kind of criticism that really gets to us, that cuts right to our hearts and then lingers in our minds for weeks afterwards, is one that already aligns with a criticism we have of ourselves. Let me demonstrate. If I were to meet you and then tell you, “you have weird hands. Your hands are stupid looking,” what would happen next? (Other than you thinking I’m a jerk). Would you be hurt about it for days? Would you feel terrible and ashamed of your hands? Most likely not.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are you talking about? They’re hands. They seem normal enough to me…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unless, of course, you have some ongoing criticism of your hands. If so, replace the word “hands” in this example with “elbows.” I’d imagine very few people receive self-criticism about their elbows.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The point here is criticism only gets in when your inner critic has already paved the way. And when you’re doing these kinds of exercises, like the acceptance paradox, you’re mainly dealing with your own inner critic. You can argue with and defend yourself against your critic all day, and usually not make it very far. But if you simply accept the grain of truth, without taking on the implication that you’re bad, you can feel a deep sense of freedom and relief.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">The Peace Process</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">We discussed the peace process earlier in the chapter about boundaries. It’s an extremely valuable tool, and one that I use every day. It’s especially valuable in helping resolve feelings of fear and anger about others being upset with us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There are many ways to access the feelings you have about others being upset with you. Sometimes, it’s easy because there is actually someone upset with you. If that’s not happening, you can imagine doing something you learned in this book, such as asking for what you want or saying no to someone. When you imagine doing that, you may start to fear someone being upset. I’ve found that behind almost all of our surface fears, there’s a deeper fear of the pain that comes with someone being upset with us, judging us, or otherwise disapproving of us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve accessed the feeling, simply bring all of your attention right to the sensation in your body. Stay out of your mind – no need to make sense of the feeling, justify it, or challenge it. It doesn’t need to make sense or be rational. Drop beneath your mind and go down, down to the center of the feeling in your throat, chest, stomach, or anywhere else you feel it in your body.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then, just breathe. Be with it. Meet it with curiosity, acceptance, patience, and love. This is a form of self-soothing that is often much more healing than trying to think your way out of it. As you tune in even deeper to the subtle sensations in your body, you can gently repeat in your mind the following phrase, “It’s OK. You’re OK.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you want to significantly become less afraid of others being upset with you, I recommend doing this exercise for twenty minutes each day. Sometimes the feelings will dissolve and you will feel completely relaxed. Other times you will feel them for twenty minutes, and you’ll still feel fear or pain about someone being upset. That’s fine. Each time you do this, you’re providing a level of love and healing to yourself that you may have never received before. It’s like working out or eating vegetables: even if it doesn’t immediately feel good every single time, it’s extremely helpful overall. Trust that each time you do it, you’re healing, releasing fear, and becoming more powerful, confident, and free to be you.</p>
