<h4 class="Header-02">Perfectionism and Insane Rules</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">To recap the Guilt-Neutralizing process so far, it goes something like this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. Notice when you are feeling guilty and identify it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. Slow down and study the experience of guilt: what does it feel like in your body, what thoughts do you notice in your mind?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">3. Ask yourself this question: <span class="CharOverride-9">What rule have I broken?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">4. If it’s a rule that’s realistic and reflects your values, then feel your heart, forgive yourself, and receive the message.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, there is another major source of guilt that is very different than the one we’ve been focusing on. This is what we’ve been calling Unhealthy Guilt. This is guilt that comes from rules that you’ve broken that aren’t based on your personal core values.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, they are based on completely unrealistic standards for human behavior, emotions, and relationships. They are rigid, all-or-nothing, demanding, and generally impossible to adhere to.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These include rules like:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never feel angry.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never feel anxious.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never make a mistake.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should always know what to say.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never hurt anyone’s feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never upset anybody.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should always have total self-control.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be able to predict all outcomes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I should foresee all problems and avoid them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I should obtain _____ <span class="CharOverride-9">now</span>
 . (Insert any result you are striving towards)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you’re feeling guilty and you slow down to pay attention, you’ll hear these kinds of rules running through your mind. Sometimes it’s direct, such as, “I should be able to predict all outcomes.” More commonly, you’ll just hear that voice in your head chastising you with comments like: <span class="CharOverride-9">I should have known! Why did I do that? So stupid!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These kinds of commands are driving you to go harder, perform better, be more, achieve more, and do it all faster. Reach your goals by yesterday. You’re taking too long. Why aren’t you there already? You should be making faster progress. You should have achieved everything you wanted by now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Underneath all of these commands is one central theme: <span class="CharOverride-9">What’s wrong with you?</span>
 The more you listen to them and follow them unquestioningly, the worse you feel about yourself. The more insufficient, inadequate, unlovable and unworthy you think you are, regardless of external achievement or how much others love you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are insane rules. When you identify one of these rules, the answer is not to take the message to strive harder and set up more rituals or commitments. <span class="CharOverride-10">The response in these situations is to slow down, and let go of the demand on yourself to be superhuman.</span>
 Let go of this insane rule that is driving you so hard and creating so much suffering.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This rule is not your friend. It might seem like it’s your inner coach, pushing you to succeed and “be your best,” but actually it’s the voice of self-hatred. It’s coming from a mindset of: I’m not complete or whole as I am. I am inadequate, insufficient, lacking. I am not good enough. I am not fully lovable as I am. I must do this, achieve this, live by this crazy rule. <span class="CharOverride-9">Then</span>
 , I’ll be enough. Then I’ll be somebody. Then I’ll be worthy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let it go. This way of living is creating tension and pain. And worst of all, even if you were to achieve your goal, there would be no relief. Of course your mind says there will be. But has there been in the past? Haven’t you achieved things before? Did you feel amazing, at peace, and fully content? Did the incessant demands, self-criticism, and guilt stop for good? What happened?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Perhaps a few minutes of relief, and then a new goal. Ten times the size! Realistically it should take years to achieve, but you should get there within three months. Better yet, tomorrow. What’s wrong with you, why haven’t you done it yet?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you see the insanity?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let it go.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Use the process outlined above in the “Breaking the Rules” section to soften these extreme rules. Slow down and examine each one. Find the place in your body that is tight, freaking out, and squeezing when you imagine you have to follow the rule. Bring love and attention to that part of your body. Let go. Let it go.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You don’t need to do anything. You don’t need to achieve anything more. You’re enough. You’re lovable, and you are loved. You’re worthy, right now, as you are. You are somebody, and you’ve arrived. You’re already here! Welcome!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And now that you’re here, I want to introduce you to a simple, but extremely powerful activity that will rapidly strengthen your inner sense of authority. It will help you live by your own rules, and shed years of people pleasing and unnecessary, unhelpful guilt. In short, it will make you one powerful mofo.</p>
