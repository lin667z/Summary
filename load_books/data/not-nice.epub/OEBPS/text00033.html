 ict Avoidance</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If you learned that anger is bad, it hurts others, and shows you are weak or unlovable, guess what happens? Avoidance, of course. If something is scary, uncomfortable, threatening and only leads to pain and problems in relationships, and it makes you a “bad person,” then why on earth would you <span class="CharOverride-9">not</span>
 try to avoid it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, we become masters of conflict avoidance. The nicer we are, the better we become at this. And it’s not just conflict. We become skilled at avoiding all forms of argument, disagreement, tension, differing opinions, or upset. Instead of bending over backwards to accommodate people, we become like ultra-flexible yogis who can contort their bodies into strange shapes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may be aware that you’re doing this conflict avoidance dance, and you may not be. I became so skilled at this that it was like a program that was running in the background of a computer. I didn’t even consciously do it most of the time. It came across in every aspect of my behavior: the way I greeted people, what I would say, the questions I would ask, what I would share versus hold back, how I looked at people, and so much more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are you a master of conflict avoidance and great at smoothing things over? Do you instantly pick up what mood someone is in and start to accommodate it? If they seem tense or upset, do you try to cheer them up? Or do you steer clear, tiptoe around, and walk on eggshells so as to not disturb them?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s uncover two of the major ways you might be consistently avoiding conflict, disagreement, or friction. Going into this topic directly can be a little uncomfortable, especially if you’ve been avoiding it for years. Worse still, part of you knows that uncovering these patterns will eventually lead to you having more conflict, disagreement, and friction in your life. Yikes!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, here’s why it’s a good thing. While conflict and disagreement don’t <span class="CharOverride-9">feel</span>
 good, they’re part of having direct contact with your fellow humans. Direct contact means you show up fully, are present with others, look them in the eye, listen to them, share what you think and feel, and have a real connection. It’s the opposite of staying small, avoiding eye contact, and displaying just a small fraction of yourself that you hope will receive their approval.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is an important point, and amounts to a fundamental shift in how you move through the world. I spent many years afraid of direct contact. I wanted love and connection, just like every human does, but I didn’t want tension, differing opinions, anger, or any of that scary stuff. I just wanted nice, pleasant interactions amongst nice, pleasant people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unfortunately, partial contact creates partial connection and only partial fulfillment. It’s cowardly. It’s being too scared to put myself out there in the world. It’s trying to get the good feelings without any risk. It’s trying to fill my heart up while still keeping it guarded and defended. And it doesn’t work.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">If you want to experience a rich, fulfilling, meaningful and significant life, direct contact is required.</span>
 You must step up and claim your right to be here: <span class="CharOverride-9">Here I am. I am here. I have a right to be here. I belong here. I am me, and I matter. Not because I’m the smartest, or the best, or perfect. Just because. Permission was granted by my birth.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In other words, to have the life you want–love, relationships, success, confidence, power, freedom–you must be all in. You must be willing to feel the full spectrum of human emotion, and experience the full spectrum of human contact. This includes laughter, shared joy, and sweet harmony. Those moments where you feel in harmony, madly in love, and like your life is magnified a thousand-fold by having someone so amazing to share it with. But it also involves disagreement, having hard conversations, and navigating conflict and hurt feelings. Believe it or not, conflict is your doorway to having the life you really want.</p>
