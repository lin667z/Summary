<h4 class="Header-02">I Gotta Go</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I was standing outside at 11 pm in the humid air of Boca Raton, Florida. A man I just met earlier that day was telling me an in-depth story about his marriage, and how he was going to end it when he got home. I was tired, weak in my body, mildly feverish, and not engaged. How did I get here?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was at a Tony Robbins’ seminar called <span class="CharOverride-9">Date With Destiny</span>
 . We were on day 5 of 6 and I had fallen hard with a cold, or flu, or whichever (I never really knew the difference). All I knew is I felt physically awful.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This seminar inspires people to examine their lives and make big decisions about who they want to be and the future they want to create for themselves. It’s a powerful experience and helps me grow as a man, a husband and father, and makes me better able to serve my clients.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It also stirs up quite a bit in people, especially those who are living lives they know are not right for them, such as being in the wrong career, wrong relationship, or eating the wrong diet. It agitates you and inspires you to take action to make things better, or make drastic changes, instead of settling. All good stuff.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Except for this conversation with Antonio. We had done some sharing in a small group earlier that day, where I had first heard about his struggles in his relationship. As we were walking out of the seminar room for a quick break at a 11 pm, before we returned for the last segment that would likely go until 2 am, Antonio approached me and said, “So what do you think about my situation? Do you have any advice for me?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If I were being 100% me, completely free to say and do whatever I wanted, able to fully take care of myself in that situation, I would have said, “Hey Antonio! I appreciate you asking me, man. At the moment I’m actually feeling pretty lousy and my energy is very low. I’m going to take a few minutes just to rest and reflect.” Even now as I write, several months later, I feel a sense of retroactive relief. Ahhh. Freedom feels good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But, that’s not what I did. <span class="CharOverride-9">What? Aren’t you the guy writing the book on not being nice?</span>
 Ha, I appreciate the irony. But we teach what we need to reinforce most, and I am always learning and growing and pushing my own edge, just like you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">He had seemed somewhat lost when describing his situation earlier that day. I had also noticed a strong, pleasing, approval-seeking energy coming from him when interacting with me and others in the group, especially the women. So when he asked for my input, I decided to try to help him for several minutes, then take a few minutes to rest. Win, win.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I didn’t anticipate, however, was his level of need in that moment. It was less so for input, and more to simply share his experience. He wanted to have someone witness and see his struggle, the pain he was in, how he had been managing it, areas he felt guilty, why he was angry, and all the rest. It was a big deal. He was going to leave a marriage of seven years and they had one small child together. Of course, he’s going to have lots of feelings he’s going to need to explore, feel, share with others, and work through.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But I wasn’t up for that on that particular night. So after about ten minutes of conversation (mostly me listening and giving him attention), I made my clear and decisive escape. “Antonio,” I said, interrupting him to create a pause in his speaking, “I admire the courage it takes to do what you’re doing. You are a thoughtful man and a good person. I know you’ll get through this to the other side... but at the moment I need to take a few minutes to rest and take care of myself. I’ll see you back in the room.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Immediately upon saying that, I initiated a good strong hug, and promptly moved away, eliminating the possibility of continuing the conversation. I walked through the warm night air for several minutes, breathing, feeling my body, noticing the wind blowing the palm trees above my head against the jet-black sky. I consciously let go of any energy of his I may have taken on. I also checked to see if there was any guilt about ending the conversation, about not doing whatever I could to help someone who was clearly wanting and hoping for my attention, support, and guidance. To my delight, there was none. I knew it was OK for me to do what I wanted and needed. And I knew if he wanted support there were other people there who would be excited to offer that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is yet another example of the subtle and simple power of being less nice and more you. As you read this story, you may think it’s no big deal. You may have no problems interrupting, directing, or leaving conversations quickly and easily. Or, if you’ve found yourself stuck in conversations, giving when you’d rather not, unsure of how to break free, and then feeling impatient and irritable afterwards, this story might be the very thing that gives you permission and sets you free.</p>
