<h4 class="Header-02">Smarter, Better, More Certain</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Sometimes it is hard to honor your perspective because you’re not so sure inside yourself. Maybe you don’t know what you think about something, or where you stand on a topic. This might be from a lack of practice of discovering and honoring your perspective. In fact, you may have years of habitually assuming your thoughts, opinions, and feelings about a subject don’t matter much. But as you examine what your perspective is more and more, your sense of certainty will grow stronger.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You also might be automatically assuming that other perspectives are more valid because you deem them as smarter and better. Part of this might be due to their age, experience, or status. It might also be a response to the level of certainty they have when they communicate. If they sound confident, it can automatically create a sense of uncertainty or doubt inside of you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But remember this: Certainty does not correlate with accuracy. Just because someone <span class="CharOverride-9">sounds</span>
 certain, it does not mean that what they’re saying is accurate. It also doesn’t mean that it’s more thought out, researched, or backed by anything at all.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">People Just Say Stuff</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I remember one moment in graduate school when this became glaringly obvious to me. I was in my third year of doctoral training to become a clinical psychologist and had a good deal of uncertainty about my skills, knowledge, and ability to help people. Other people were more confident in their approaches, their theories, and what they would do in any situation. They had strong opinions about different methodologies, medications, and treatments. Everyone seemed to have it all together.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One morning I was sitting in group supervision with a seasoned psychologist and several other practicum students and interns. We were in a community clinic where we provided counseling to a wide variety of clients of all ages and backgrounds. One of my colleagues was confidently asserting a theory about how to intervene in a specific situation involving children. She was saying something to the effect of, “The research shows that you must do A, and not B.” Her tone was decisive. She implied that if you do B, then you’re an idiot.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Something sounded a little fishy, though. I didn’t think that B was quite so bad, and I was curious to learn more. So, I said, “Interesting, I haven’t heard that before. What research did you read that said that?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well…” she replied, sheepishly, “I saw it on <span class="CharOverride-9">Supernanny</span>
 .”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I kid you not: <span class="CharOverride-9">Supernanny</span>
 ! The British TV show starring Jo Frost who does dramatic turn-arounds of naughty children. Nothing against Jo Frost, and I don’t doubt that she’s helpful, but that is hardly “the clinical research” that my colleague was throwing around moments earlier.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In that moment the curtain was pulled back and I saw Oz was just a little gray-haired man, frantic and uncertain, hastily manipulating controls in order to look all-knowing and all-powerful. I realized this is happening behind everyone’s facade, from doctors, to TV experts, to your seemingly confident boss or CEO. Those people might have a lot of experience, insight, and factual knowledge on various topics. And, they are prone to bias like the rest of us, are uncertain about all kinds of things, even in their field of expertise, and often just fill in the gaps with as much certainty as they can muster.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I remember another conversation I had with the head psychiatrist in another clinic one morning before a meeting. He was the clinic co-director and the head honcho. He sat drinking his coffee and eating a scone and he said, “This whole anti-gluten craze just boggles my mind. There’s no scientific evidence that gluten impacts people in all the ways they say it does.” He continued to strongly and assertively share his opinions about the foolish people who avoided gluten.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I found the topic fascinating and had been personally exploring the effects of gluten on my body. I had not come to any strong conclusions yet, but I was curious about what his sources were, because he was indicating that it was a well-researched medical opinion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That weekend I was spending time with a good friend of mine who had just completed his medical school training. I asked him how much research and training students had around the topic of diet and nutrition and its impact on health.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“We had one seminar on that.” He said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Like one ongoing class? For how long, like a quarter or a semester?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No. One, three-hour seminar on diet, nutrition, and how food impacts disease.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, I have no idea if the psychiatrist at my clinic studied dozens of hours of nutritional information on his own time, although I highly doubt it, given his seemingly poor diet and general appearance of sub-optimal health.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The truth is people just say stuff. They package it in certainty and lean on their education, experience, or status to make it sound like it’s highly researched and valid. Start to pay attention to this phenomenon around you. Question the sources of people’s knowledge, and start to see through the illusion that others’ opinions are more intelligent or important than your own. Start to look inward and find your own thoughts and feelings about the subjects you encounter in your daily life.</p>
