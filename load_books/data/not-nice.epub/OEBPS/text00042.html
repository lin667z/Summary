<h4 class="Header-02">5. Isolation</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">The final specter of niceness is particularly sad and ironic. We do all this nice stuff, put others first and sacrifice what we want, and try so hard, all because we want to be liked, to be loved. We try to be nice to others so they feel good around us and want to spend more time with us, whether it’s friends, colleagues, or a new lover. We show up as our best selves, hold back our judgments and criticisms, focus on other people, and are attentive, kind, generous, and caring. We do the right thing. We are good people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We hope this will give us a deep sense of love and connection. A feeling of closeness, intimacy, and the joy that can come from those sweet experiences. Yet, this feeling is elusive, and hard to come by. Even if we talk with colleagues, spend time with friends, or go on a date, we still feel lonely. We don’t feel deeply connected to others, and we don’t really trust that they absolutely love and adore us. We can’t rest easy in knowing we’re loved and held. Instead, there can be a chronic underlying feeling of loneliness and anxiety.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This sense of isolation is another direct result of niceness. Because when we’re being nice and people respond well, something is a little off. They might like you, or even love you, but they don’t really <span class="CharOverride-9">know</span>
 you. They know a part of you; they know your mask or persona. And while this might give you some connection in the form of people to hang out with and talk to, it doesn’t give you the connection you really seek.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This only comes when we share more of ourselves with others. When we are able to remove the mask and share what’s really going on–how we really feel and think, including our fears, desires, challenges, and dreams. This also includes expressing ourselves. If you’re silly, or like to do funny voices, or passionately sing classic rock songs with your eyes closed, this needs to come out as well. It’s not just what you share that makes you. It’s also how you share it, how you show up, how life moves through you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And nice is a big stop sign on all of that. On the sharing, the vulnerability, the authenticity, and the self-expression. It is a controlled, managed, and rigid way of being in the world, which keeps the real you trapped.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">---</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Whew, what a list. What did you notice about yourself as you read about these specters? Which ones tend to haunt you the most?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you want to live the rest of your life dealing with these same challenges? Do you want to feel perpetually anxious about people’s approval, guilty about not doing enough for others, and scared of them being upset? How many more years of anxiety, resentment, physical pain, powerlessness, and isolation do you want to live with?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are important questions to ask yourself, because they will activate dissatisfaction with the way things are right now. That is a good thing. Because that discomfort can create a powerful force inside of you that steps up and says, “NO! No more. I will not live this way.” And that’s exactly the force you will need to propel you right through the bars of the nice person cage.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In just a moment, we are going to turn our attention to exactly how to do this. How to break free finally to become the most powerful, free, confident and authentic version of yourself. This version of yourself also happens to be the most charismatic, charming, attractive, loving, and successful one as well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">However, before we do, we must take one moment to see if you’re ready. Because here’s the truth. Breaking out of years of nice person conditioning isn’t a one-step instantaneous process. It isn’t an easy quick fix that involves no discomfort or effort. It isn’t a machine that shocks your stomach muscles while you sit on the couch watching TV until you have rock hard six-pack abs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, it’s a process. It’s a process that can transform your self-esteem, relationships, and life, but it requires commitment. Let’s take a moment to determine your level of commitment before we move to the next chapter.</p>
