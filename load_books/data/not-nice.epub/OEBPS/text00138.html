<h4 class="Header-02">Upset in Others</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Do you spend a great deal of time worried that someone might get upset with you? Does it cause background anxiety when you’re on your way to work, or going to the gym? Is your body subtly braced for impact, just waiting for that moment that someone might criticize you, voice disappointment, or otherwise show upset?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or, it might be less pervasive and arise in specific situations. Perhaps you feel that fear only when having a conversation about money or sex with your partner. Or when you negotiate your rates for your business or services. Or when you speak your opinion firmly in a meeting. The list of potential places is endless, but the underlying fear is the same–someone might be upset with me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s handle this right now. It’s time to stop living in fear of this generally infrequent, non-threatening event. This fear is a remnant of our evolutionary past, when our brains needed to scan the environment for threats to our lives. Currently, few of us have daily threats to our lives, yet our brain is designed to run that scan all day, every day. Given the absence of predators or physical danger, “someone being upset with me” has moved up the hierarchy of danger.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s OK, because that’s just our two-million-year-old brain doing what it’s designed to do. The issue is when we respond to the danger messages as if they’re entirely real and life-threatening. <span class="CharOverride-10">The truth is, someone being upset with us is just a trigger for a series of uncomfortable feelings in our body. That’s it.</span>
 So, if you can manage those uncomfortable feelings, you’re fine. No puncture wounds from teeth, no skulls cracked, no being ostracized from the tribe to starve in the wilderness, and no death. Just discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s look at three specific techniques you can use today to handle the discomfort of someone being upset with you. These tools will give you confidence that you can deal with the situation when it arises, and help you let go of the chronic fear of it happening in the future.</p>
