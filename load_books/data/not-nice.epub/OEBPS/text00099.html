Disagreement, &amp; Other<br/>
“Difficult Conversations”</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Imagine these scenarios…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You are working on a big project with a coworker, and all of a sudden you realize that he lied to you and to the customer. This is going to cause a big problem for the company, but you’ve been working on this project together for months and you don’t want to make him look bad…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of your employees frequently has a disgruntled attitude that she communicates with voice tone and body language. Sometimes she’s warm in her responses, but often it seems like she’s pissed at everybody, including you. She also is resistant to change and doesn’t consistently implement new strategies to grow the business…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You had an agreement with a subcontractor and they failed to deliver on an aspect of the project. You had a conversation with them about this and they promised they would send you weekly updates of their progress every Friday. It’s 9p.m. on Friday evening and you haven’t heard anything from them…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are just a few of hundreds of specific examples clients and myself have faced that require objecting, disagreeing, or initiating an uncomfortable conversation. And these examples are just from a work setting–we haven’t even gotten started on dating and relationships yet!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The reality is we come across situations on a weekly basis that would be better to address than avoid. But so often, avoiding is our primary response to any potentially uncomfortable conversation. All our fears from the chart earlier about what will happen if we speak up, come back with a vengeance. And sometimes we don’t even let ourselves imagine speaking directly and assertively. Instead, we fill our minds with excuses and rationalizations. We explain why the other person did what they did, and tell ourselves we need to be more flexible, patient, and relaxed. <span class="CharOverride-9">I should just let it go…</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, sometimes it is good to let things go. But most of the time this is a fear of a direct conversation. In fact, that direct conversation where you address the challenges head on is the fastest and best way to actually let it go and move on. And since the need for these conversations arise at work, in your friendships, with family, and in your romantic relationship, learning how to handle them is essential. In fact, <span class="CharOverride-10">the quality of your life depends on how many of these uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you can skillfully talk about sex, money, how to raise your kids, and all the other hot-button topics in a relationship, then you will have an extraordinary relationship. If you cannot, then you will avoid these topics, reduce intimacy, grow distant, and live together-but-separate lives of loneliness and quiet desperation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you can say what needs to be said, call out problems, and directly ask people what’s going on at work, you will quickly rise to the rank of leader. If you run your own business, or manage others, you will create effective teams that get the job done quickly with minimal drama. If you avoid the uncomfortable conversations, you will never be recognized as a leader who can handle challenges and solve problems. You will also likely feel angry and resentful inside, blaming others for your frustration, and seeing it as unfair when others get promoted.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, let’s just say this skill is important. Here’s how to do it right.</p>
