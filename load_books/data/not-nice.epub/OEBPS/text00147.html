 he Rules</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">So, how do you make new rules? How do you consciously choose and create the rules you want to live by. Not your mom’s rules, or your dad’s rules, or even many of the rules you grew up with in your society. YOUR rules.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Guess what? You already did! Whew, finally, a break.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The good news is you already did all the heavy lifting back in Chapter 6 with your personal Bill of Rights. Remember that exercise? Take a moment to find what you wrote now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you have this list, you simply tweak the wording ever so slightly on your list by changing “I have a right to” to “I am allowed to.” For example:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Bill of Rights</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I have the right to approach anyone I want to start a conversation with them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I have the right to change the subject or end the conversation whenever I would like.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I have the right to say “no” to anything I don’t want to do, for any reason, without needing to justify it or give an excuse.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I have the right to ask for what I want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Aziz’s Rules</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I am allowed to approach anyone I want to start a conversation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I am allowed to change the subject or end the conversation whenever I would like.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I am allowed to say “no” to anything I don’t want to do, for any reason, without needing to justify it or give an excuse.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I am allowed to ask for what I want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And so on, all the way down your entire list. Take a moment now to write out your new list in this way, giving it the title “_____’s Rules,” using your own name. If your list is digital and on your phone or computer, you may be tempted to use copy and paste. I would actually encourage you to type it out again, or even better yet, write it another time by hand. The more you drill these rules into your mind, the more powerful and free you become.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve finished doing this, read through your entire list of rules. How does it feel? Liberating? Empowering? Freaking awesome? It sure does for me. You might find yourself slightly nodding your head as you read through it, as if you’re listening to someone preach it, or lay down the truth. You might even feel a “hell yes!” inside of you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are YOUR rules.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Life on your terms.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The more you read these over and consciously live by them each day, the more you shed patterns of guilt, people-pleasing, and niceness. You’ll soon get to a point where you generally feel relaxed, as if you’ve done nothing wrong, even if you do something that upsets others. If you know that what you did is in alignment with your rules, then you feel fine about it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, I recently said no to someone who wanted to interview me. That in itself is no big deal because I do that all the time. But in this particular case, I’d actually initially given a weak no by saying I “maybe could in four months or so.” Then he circled back around in four months, and I said yes, out of guilt. Then, soon after that, I reached out again and said no. Gasp! How could I? What a terrible thing to do!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But in truth I felt OK about it. In my rulebook, I am allowed to change my mind and I am allowed to say no for any reason. In fact, in my world, it’s especially important to say no when I notice I initially said yes out of my old nice guy habits. I want to nip those in the bud, so if I see myself acting that way, I try to go back and clean it up as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">His response to my no was fascinating to read. You can see it in the very last chapter of this book, called “Not Nice in Action,” where I share a dozen little short stories about the messy world of being not nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Regardless of whether you agree with my choices or not, I’m OK. I have a clear understanding of what my rules are. This eliminates all of that excessive, chronic, brutally painful guilt that destroys your self-esteem. It gives you clarity, integrity, strength, and power. It makes you bolder, direct, and authentic. It gives you complete permission to be you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, what you’ll discover over time is that your old rules were not the only way to live in the world. Your mind might have told you that if you broke those confining rules, you’d be rejected, hated, and shunned. People wouldn’t want to be friends with you, work with you, or date you ever again. You’d be a wretched outcast.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But as you own your rules and live them, you’ll find that all these predictions were nothing more than safety-police shenanigans. Outrageous and inaccurate predictions designed completely to keep you safe by staying in your comfort zone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, the more I operate from my personal rules and do things that my old self told me would have been terrible, the more positive feedback I receive. Instead of people getting angry at me for saying no, usually people don’t even bat an eye. Instead of people being put out by me asking for something, they’re often generous and happy to help. People treat me with more respect and they trust me more. In short, when you stop being so nice and start living by your own rules, good things happen.</p>
