<h4 class="Header-02">Destructive Guilt</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Destructive guilt is the guilt that most people feel most of the time. It is a chronic sense of failing others, falling short, not doing something right, not being good enough, and otherwise being “bad.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here are just a few examples of destructive guilt from my life and the lives of some of my clients.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Linda is asked out on a date by a man who is an avid bicyclist. He suggests they go for a bike ride on their date. Linda doesn’t really like that idea for a first date, and doesn’t even own a bike. Nevertheless, she feels guilty about telling him she’d rather do something else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A friend asks Antoine if he can hang out on Saturday evening. Antoine doesn’t really feel like going out, but he doesn’t have specific plans. He tells his friend he won’t be able to make it and feels strong guilt afterwards.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Chelsea is having an issue at work where one of her co-workers comes to talk with her many times per day. This interrupts her workflow and she doesn’t particularly enjoy the conversations. When she imagines telling her co-worker she’s busy and can’t talk right now, she experiences a crushing sense of guilt and feels bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Vihaan is in a committed relationship and he loves his partner. When he is out with his friends who are single, he feels guilty if he talks to other women. He also feels guilty for noticing women he finds attractive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I walk into the house after work and my wife is having a rough moment, feeling overwhelmed and exhausted taking care of the two kids. I feel guilty for not having been there during the day to help her.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Whatever You Do, Don’t Break the Rules</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I could go on for days and days, listing clients’ stories and my own. So much guilt, so much of the time. That’s why I refer to it as a Guilt Bubble. It’s like an energy field. It surrounds us everywhere we go. It distorts reality and turns neutral events into terrible, bad things we’ve done to hurt others and destroy the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When living in the Guilt Bubble, we’re like the villain of our own movie. Always hurting people, letting them down, doing “bad” things. This is a life swallowed by destructive guilt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What exactly is destructive guilt? As you read the examples above, what did you notice? Is there a trend? A common theme that makes them all the same? Take a moment to review them now, what exactly makes this destructive?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Some of the examples involve saying “no” to someone. Expressing what you want and don’t want. This can stir up all kinds of guilt, especially if you imagine the other person wants something else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then there’s poor Vihaan. I relate to his struggle, as it’s something that caused me great pain in many of my relationships. I used to feel so guilty for noticing, talking to, or feeling attracted to other women. What is going on here?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Each of these scenarios involves breaking a rule. If we break certain rules, we feel guilt. Regardless of whether the rule makes sense, is realistic, or we’re consciously aware of it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are the rules impacting the people in the scenarios above? Take a quick second to guess each one. This is an extremely valuable and life-changing skill to develop. If you can uncover the hidden rule behind your bad guilt, you can break free from it. Often, you’ll see just how extreme and unrealistic these rules really are. You’ll say to yourself, “I’ve been trying to live by <span class="CharOverride-9">that</span>
 ?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Read those scenarios one more time and take a quick guess for each one. What is the underlying rule that they are breaking?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve done that, continue reading.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Linda:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I should be flexible and go with the flow. If he’s really excited about it and I shoot him down, he’ll feel rejected and sad. It’s not OK to make someone feel that way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Antoine:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I should always say yes to my close friends’ requests, unless I have specific plans that make me unavailable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Chelsea:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I should listen politely to my co-worker whenever he wants to talk. If I send him away, he’ll feel hurt, angry, and lonely. It’s not OK to make someone feel that way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Vihaan:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I shouldn’t notice, talk to, or feel attracted to other women. Doing so will hurt my partner’s feelings and that is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Aziz:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I should be there to help Candace whenever she needs it, so she never struggles alone with the kids.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even as I write out my rule and make it more conscious, I start to be free of it. When I see it on paper, it’s crazy. And it’s treating Candace as if she’s a fragile creature that can’t handle demand, challenge, or discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In truth, I know that <span class="CharOverride-10">demand, challenge, and discomfort are the forces that cause us to grow and become our fullest, most powerful selves.</span>
 In fact, they’re the very signs that we are developing. They’re essential, healthy, and necessary. Not to mention that Candace is incredibly strong and resilient. She works through challenging and uncomfortable feelings and lets them go more rapidly than anyone I’ve met.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These rules are not coming from our rational, adult minds. They’re coming from deep within our emotional brain that recorded hundreds of lessons from our years of Nice Training. Lessons that your parents consciously taught you, and lessons that you learned just by being an observant, intelligent child. Mom gets mad when I resist her and say no; therefore, saying no is bad. Dad gets upset when I disagree with him; therefore, disagreeing with others is bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Many of these rules are not even things you would agree with if you slowed down and examined then consciously. They’re just old programs you picked up long ago that continue to guide your feelings and behavior, regardless of whether you believe them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In just a few chapters, we are going to have you come up with your own set of rules. Your own Bill of Rights that determines who you want to be in this world and how you want to show up. Not because someone else told you that you should, or out of fear of displeasing others, but from deep in your own core. You will decide from a place of power what is right for you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But before you can do that, you have to flush out all the debris. You can’t install a new program on top of a bunch of old, conflicting ones. You have to uninstall those, then install the one you want, the one that will serve you best, the one that is the real you finally coming out to play and enjoy your only life.</p>
