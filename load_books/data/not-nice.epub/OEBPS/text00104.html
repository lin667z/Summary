<h3 class="Header-01">The Courage to Be<a id="_idTextAnchor046"></a>
 Real</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">You have just learned dozens of mindset shifts, new models of relationships, and specific strategies for speaking up for yourself. Armed with clear tools, you may feel excited to test them out. Or you may feel terrified, like a young bird at the edge of the nest, about to see if she can flap her wings and fly. Regardless, you’re doing great. This process of breaking out of old nice-person habits and becoming a bolder, freer, more expressive person is not easy. It’s not for the faint of heart. It takes practice, commitment, and courage.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I’ve discovered, however, is that our ideas of how it will be when we speak up are often more dramatic than how it plays out in reality. We imagine a disagreement or difficult conversation with someone as this intense, extreme, life-threatening experience. Our nervous systems start to ramp up, as if we were about to rock climb a sheer cliff wall with no ropes. <span class="CharOverride-9">One false move and I could plummet to my death!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, when we’re in the moment and choose to step up and take action, it’s a very different experience. Instead of a sheer, vertical cliff, it’s more like a steep hill. It’s kind of hard to walk up it, our legs burn a little, and we get out of breath. Uncomfortable, but not fatal.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The more you practice speaking up, the more you’ll realize it’s not as dangerous as you’d thought. You say things, people respond, and the world rotates. Once in a while, someone has a strong negative reaction, but it’s rare. Generally, people don’t seem too bothered by your increased boldness, and many actually prefer you this way. And the more you take the risk to speak up, and find the courage to be real, the better your life gets.</p>
