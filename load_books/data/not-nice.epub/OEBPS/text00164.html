<h4 class="Header-02">I Can, But I’d Rather Not</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I wrote much of this book between the hours of 4:00 and 6:00a.m. Between being a dad to two small children, spending time with my wife Candace, working out, and running a business, that was the only time I found I could consistently carve out to make it happen. So I did. Level 5 Motivation, baby – whatever it takes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On weekday mornings I would get up at 3:00 am, meditate for an hour, write from about 4:20 am to 5:00 am, then go to the gym. On weekends, I could write from 4:20 am to 5:30 or 6:00 am, until the kids woke up. Somewhere in the process, we ended daylight savings time, which meant our clocks rolled back an hour, and for a short period of time, sleeping schedules were wacky and my son Zaim was waking up at 4:30 am</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here is a text exchange between me and Candace on one of those mornings at 4:28 am:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Candace</span>
 : Zaim’s body is programmed to wake up at this time it seems.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Aziz</span>
 : Dang. Is he ready to get up? I leave for the gym in about 20, but I can be with him until then.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">(pause)</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Aziz</span>
 : (although I’d rather keep writing if he’s still dozy)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Candace</span>
 : Think I can get him back to sleep.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Aziz</span>
 : Ok. Thanks!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To some people, this might seem so minor, so insignificant that they wouldn’t even think twice about it. But for a recovered Nice Person, this is a great sign of progress. My first response is me being authentic (by saying “dang”), then offering to support. In the past, I would have left it just at that. He’s up, let me help.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As soon as I sent it, however, I noticed a feeling inside of me saying, “I don’t want to stop writing right now. I’m just getting into it, and I have 20 minutes left!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I sent the next text, expressing what I’d prefer. It wasn’t a hard line. If he was up and wanting me, I certainly would have gone to get him. But notice the subtle power of the nice programming to eliminate even stating what you really want or don’t want. Notice the subtle pull towards powerlessness, where I do what I think is needed, feeling I have no choice, and then deep down start to feel resentful.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Pay attention to those signals. And note how even if you start nice, or pleasing, or accommodating, you can always say more, or change your stance. You can always find a way to speak up for what you want. Always.</p>
