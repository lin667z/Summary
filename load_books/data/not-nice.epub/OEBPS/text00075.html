<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Just the other day I was writing in my shadow journal, which is something you’ll learn about soon. I keep mine in a locked file on my computer so no one will ever read it. Heck, I don’t even go back and read it. It’s just a place for me to express everything inside of me that needs to get out. It’s not meant to be pretty, read well, or make a point. It’s full of typos and fragments.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It had been several weeks since I’d last written in the journal, and I was noticing pain in my shoulder and foot over the last few days. My mind, of course, dove at the chance to say I’d been running too much and working out in the gym. That’s why I’d “injured” myself. Spontaneously, for no reason. But I know better by now, so I went digging around in my shadow to see what I was upset, hurting, sad, or angry about.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sure enough, just below the surface was all kinds of messy stuff. Part of me was angry with my kids, my wife, my work, and my life. So, I let it speak and share whatever it wanted. This part of me was enraged when my one-year-old son, Arman, screams and screeches. He is in a phase where he expresses himself through screeches. Wanting more food, attention, or a nearby ball. It all requires an ear-piercing screech. While I generally handle it with patience outwardly, inwardly my Id was not happy about it. He wanted me to yell at Arman, and scream back in his face to make him stop. That was sure uncomfortable to imagine.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">He went on to tell me how he didn’t like how demanding the breakfast routine was, how much he hated taking care of the kids and being a parent in general. He hated all the responsibility, all the work, and the lack of time to do pleasurable activities.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This, of course, is the toned down version for you. When it came out in the journal it was full of misspelled run-on rants and expletives. It was not something I would want to show my wife or kids, or anyone really. But that’s not the point. The point is to show myself. To acknowledge that part and meet him with patience, acceptance, curiosity, and love. To hear him out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, it sometimes makes my skin crawl. That’s why we avoid it and hide in our distractions, anxiety, and physical pain. Because this stuff can be confusing and unsettling. It’s uncomfortable to see how much anger is in there, and how enraged that part can be. It’s confusing to witness those feelings while at the same time loving my children so deeply that I cry many times a week with amazement and heart-aching sweetness. Fortunately, we don’t need to make all parts of us agree or think and feel the same. We just need to hear them out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Later that day, when the boys were sleeping I was able to have a conversation with Candace about it. I told her about my challenges of parenting, my fears of life being all about responsibility and no fun, and how this part of me really hates it. Since she’s aware of shadow parts and does this kind of work herself, we were able to have a liberating conversation. No need to fix him, make him go away, or even change anything in our lives. He just needed to be heard and released.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After journaling that morning and talking with Candace that afternoon, my mood dramatically improved. I felt patient, warm, and loving with my kids. Smashing that shadow out of sight and keeping him down drains a ton of energy. Letting it up and out raised my energy level significantly and I was more playful, engaged, creative, and fun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This last part always amazes me, no matter how many times I do it. I can go for a thirty-minute walk and feel a ton of dislike, discontent, anger, rage, pettiness, jealousy, greed, lust, envy, hatred, and all the rest. Afterwards, instead of feeling down, negative, and unhappy, I feel light, refreshed, energized, and surprisingly peaceful and alert. In fact, many forms of counseling and healing therapies are effective for curing anxiety and depression because they provide a safe space for someone to examine, explore, and express all of these kinds of feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This reminds me again and again that suppressing anger, forcing smiles, and feigned happiness do not actually bring us what we seek. It’s actually our fear of anger, our shadow, and other negative feelings that keeps us trapped in pain and suffering. As always, the way out is through.</p>
