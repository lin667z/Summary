 l of Rights</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Remember back in Chapter 3 when you created that beastly list of shoulds? Those were all the demands that you place on yourself, and that you imagine others expect of you. You also marked the ones that seemed excessive, rigid, or oppressive with an unhappy face. Take a moment to review that list now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Where is this list guiding you? What impact is it having on your life? On how you feel day to day? To me, this list represents bondage–being a slave to our tyrannical inner demands and dictates. A slave to rules that keep us frightened, small, and anxious as we frantically attempt to satisfy them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a look at that list. Is it really possible to satisfy all of them? Are some of them even conflicting, like, “speak up for yourself and say what’s on your mind” and “don’t ever hurt anyone’s feelings, ever”? How does that work? It doesn’t. Conflicting rules, as well as rigid or extreme rules, just lead to a perpetual sense of falling short, failing, and guilt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You need a new set of rules. Better yet, you need a list of rights, things that you are allowed to do in any situation. A list of rights encourages authenticity, freedom, self-expression, and being who you really are in the world. It preserves your self-respect, personal power, and autonomy. It moves you forward and lets you create the life you want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ready? Let’s do it now.</p>
