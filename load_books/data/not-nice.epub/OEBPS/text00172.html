<h4 class="Header-02">But He’ll Be Upset!</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Remember back in the Say No chapter when I gave you five tips on how to say no? Well, one of those tips was to say no early. When you know that you don’t want to do something, if you stall or delay out of politeness, it just gets worse later on. That’s exactly what I did.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A man who works as a coach reached out to me to interview me for his podcast. I get a lot of requests for this and sometimes I say yes, sometimes I say no, depending on my project schedule, and if I am drawn to the person and the work they’re doing in the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">With this particular request, I didn’t really want to do it. I couldn’t exactly say why, but I didn’t fully trust my instincts, so I told my assistant to give him a nice-guy “no.” Which was to say, “We’re all booked up for the next four months, let’s check back then.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Well, sure enough, four months later he emailed again. And I still didn’t want to do it, but I already brushed him off once, so I had her send him my calendar link. We went back and forth with timing and rescheduling, and then finally he got something booked for a few weeks out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Every time I looked at my calendar and saw that interview, I felt a sense of aversion. I didn’t know why. I just didn’t want to do it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Meanwhile, I was writing this damn book about saying no, not being nice, and saying no to things that aren’t a hell yes for you. <span class="CharOverride-9">Lousy book, making me not be a hypocrite.</span>
 Actually, it was a beautiful blessing, and writing this only strengthens my commitment to take care of myself and not live life as a frightened nice guy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I told my assistant in a morning meeting that I was going to cancel his appointment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What?” she exclaimed. “Oh, he’s going to hate us.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Possibly,” I said. “But I really don’t want to do it. And I have to honor that. There are many other people he can interview. I’ll send him an email personally, being honest and vulnerable.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And so I did:</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hi XXXX,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I hope this email finds you well. I know Jenee has been in touch with you regarding scheduling an interview.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Part of me growing my business and reaching more people has been to learn about managing my time.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I have been realizing this last month that I actually have a tendency to say yes to too many things and over-commit myself, leaving less energy and time for clients, projects, taking care of myself, and family.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">As a result, I am scaling way back on the commitments I’m making to do interviews and other things.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">For this reason, I am going to cancel our upcoming interview. My apologies for the long delay. It’s taking me some time to learn how to properly manage my time.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I wish you all the best in your work, and know you are doing great things to help people.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">With love,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Aziz</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There, I’d done it. I’d said no when I wanted to. Good for me. I felt surprisingly relaxed and calm sending that. In the past, I would have either just done the interview or said no but felt absolutely freaked out and guilty afterwards. I was giving myself a pat on the back later that day when I got this provocative response.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hi Aziz</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Thanks for letting me know.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I can relate with scaling back as I too have been taking on too much lately. Like you I am giving more time to myself.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Here&apos;s the thing though. I am now left with a big hole for this month&apos;s interview series. Worse, I have told my readers, my list, my family, nearly everyone I know I&apos;m interviewing you. They are going to think one of two things: I&apos;m a big fat liar or you&apos;re a complete asshole. Either way, it doesn&apos;t look good for both of us.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">So I&apos;d like to suggest I email you 8-10 questions and you email me back your responses. I don&apos;t need the answers until the 28th of this month so you have plenty of time to fulfill your commitment.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I&apos;ll be in touch soon with the questions.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Regards</p>
<p class="Email-Text">XXXX</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s when the feelings came in. My first response wasn’t guilt, it was anger. I was responsible for his interview series? But he was the one who bounced it back and rescheduled it most recently. I made a commitment and he feels entitled that I answer 8-10 email questions? That will take way longer than the interview! Implying that I’m an asshole if I say no? Grrr!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I took a step back and just felt my breath. I tuned into my heart and found the fear and guilt underneath the anger.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should do it. I said I would do it. I should just do it and make it short and get it over with.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But then I felt something deeper. A commitment to live life on my terms. To move towards what enlivens me and away from that which doesn’t serve me, even if I can’t rationally explain it, even if it makes others upset sometimes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once I reconnected to myself, I was less triggered. I was also clear that I would not participate, since I did not owe him anything. This was a free interview I was giving to help him grow his business and audience.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I responded with compassion and brevity. I’ve often found that less explanation is better.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Hi XXXX,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I’m flattered that you have shared with so many people : )</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Unfortunately, I will not be able to answer those questions via email.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I’m sorry you feel concerned about how people will respond. My sense is that if you tell them the truth and are vulnerable, they will still like, love, and appreciate you.</p>
<p class="Email-Text">I wish you all the best,</p>
<p class="Email-Text">Aziz</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Maybe he’ll dislike that response. Maybe he’ll think I’m patronizing or condescending to him. Maybe he’ll tell all his friends, family, and fans that I’m a complete asshole. That’s OK. I feel at peace, and I feel respect and love for him. I want the best for him. And I am not responsible for how he sees me, and how he manages his feelings.</p>
