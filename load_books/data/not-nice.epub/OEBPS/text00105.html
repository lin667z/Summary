<h4 class="Header-02">Post Speak-Up Freak-out</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">There is one phenomenon you must be aware of as you embark on your journey of more boldness and badassery, and that is the Post Speak-Up Freak-out. The PSF often occurs immediately after speaking up for yourself. In the moment itself, you may have been direct, powerful, and assertive. You may have actually enjoyed your newfound powers, and even gotten a positive response. But then, on your drive home… PSF.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You start to review the scenario, playing it from different angles. You watch and re-watch scenes of the event, like a football coach who’s watching game footage to spot key errors. Soon, the high of breaking free and the peace of being your authentic self in the world starts to turn into unease, then doubt, then full on freak-out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">That was way too forceful. Did you see Jennifer’s face when I said that to Charles? She thought I was being so pushy and whiny. Oh geez, Charles probably thought that too. Why did I go on and on about that car engine analogy?? They got the point already. I was too forceful. I came across as desperate. Pathetic. They think I’m so pathetic. They hate me!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Dates, meetings, conversations with your partner, sharing more of yourself with friends or family–nothing is safe from the PSF. It’s all fair game. In fact, it’s helpful to anticipate this so you know how to interpret it accurately.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The obvious interpretation might be that the voice in your head is accurate. You <span class="CharOverride-9">did</span>
 step out of line, go too far, or otherwise do something to offend others and embarrass yourself. Or, you could see the truth, that this is total hogwash buffoonery. This is actually nothing more than your Safety Police. The part of you that is terrified of taking risks, being bolder, and revealing who you are in the world. In fact, it’s terrified of any change, no matter how positive. Sure, speaking up boldly makes you feel more vital and fully engaged in life, but it also opens you up to rejection and other emotional pain. So, your Safety Police causes the Post Speak-Up Freak-out to try to push you back into line.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to develop your assertiveness and strength, it&apos;s essential to see the PSF as just a reaction to stepping outside your comfort zone. Give little to no attention to the replays and anxiety that follows. See it just as a part of you that is trying to get you back into your nice person comfort zone. Smile and thank it for trying to do its job, and then move on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What you said or did wasn&apos;t out of line, too far, or offensive. Even if your mind is telling you this is the case. Even if it sounds convincing and certain. Because, at this point your sensors on what is OK to say and do may not be fully and accurately calibrated. If they were stuck on the nice-person approval-seeking setting, then anything bold or authentic is labeled as offensive and bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to calibrate your sensors and really know if you were too aggressive or out of line, you will need more practice. Now is not the time to stop. In fact, you&apos;re just getting started.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, the next time you speak up for yourself, take bold action, and step outside your comfort zone, give yourself an internal high-five. Then, when your Safety Police begins its PSF, follow this science-based, highly researched medical protocol:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">1. Open up YouTube on your phone or computer.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">2. Look up: “Le Freak” by <span class="CharOverride-9">Chic</span>
 and press play.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">3. Dance in your car and sing along!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Aaahh freak out!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Le freak, see&apos;est Chic</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Freak out!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Have you heard about the new dance craze?</span>
</p>
