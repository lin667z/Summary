<h4 class="Header-02">The Pleaser’s Plight</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">My entire teenage years and into my early twenties could be called a “dateless drought.” Well, that’s not entirely true, because I did have two women in that decade who pursued me. And I did start working up the courage in my early twenties to ask women out on dates, although usually it lead to a polite “no” or just one date. I guess like any drought, it rained occasionally. But it was so infrequent, so unsatisfying, and so mysteriously unsustainable, that I naturally concluded there was something deeply, terribly wrong with me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I simply did not realize that I was experiencing the subtle rejection that a pleaser gets while attempting to date. As a pleaser–if you’re good at it–no one harshly rejects you, tells you to buzz off, or gets upset at you. They just feel “meh” towards you and politely distance themselves, don’t return you calls, or say “no, thank you” to a second date.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Have you experienced this? It goes both ways, always. Men dating women, women dating men, men dating men, women dating women, and transgender dating too… in all scenarios, being a pleaser doesn’t produce the best results.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, this doesn’t mean it never works. I know many nice people who end up in long-term relationships as pleasers. Usually, however, there is some sort of suffering in this relationship–they feel inadequate, there’s no sex life or passion, their partner frequently criticizes them, they feel tons of (mostly unconscious) resentment, or the two of them never fight and live completely peacefully... as roommates who live separate lives. These are just a few of the scenarios that I and many of my recovering nice-people clients have found ourselves in.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This suffering occurs because people-pleasing and niceness do not work in romantic relationships. As Tony Robbins points out, “women want to be pleased, but they don’t want a pleaser.” I think this is true for everybody, not just women. Why is this the case? If we all want to be pleased, why doesn’t someone who’s eager to please us turn us on?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After reading through this beast of a book up until this point, why do you think? What’s your guess? You probably have some keen insights and powerful awareness after having made such a deep study over these last days and weeks. Because if I share my ideas, it can be helpful. But if you decide for yourself, it will be instantly transformative.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">People pleasing isn’t attractive because it’s not authentic. We’re not being who we really are.</span>
 When we’re looking to please, our focus is on how to say and do what we think the other person wants, regardless of what is true for us. This disconnect from our true selves immediately reduces our attractiveness. Then, to make matters worse, we’re operating from a place of fear. Fear of upsetting the other person, fear of saying the wrong thing, fear of looking foolish, fear of being judged, and even fear of our own guilt. All this fear is another layer of attractiveness repellent that we spray on ourselves when we’re being nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We think that a polished, polite image is what’s going to win the hearts of those we desire. But actually, it’s your true shape, rough edges, and unrefined energy that is going to attract your beloved. Those are powerful, compelling, and highly desirable. The way you just say what you think, express what you feel, and laugh at what’s funny to you. The way you scrunch your nose up in disgust at oysters and other things you don’t like. Your ability to be right there with the other person, making real contact with each other. That is what creates the charge.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I went on many of those first dates I didn’t know all this. I felt deflated, confused, frustrated, and inferior after those women didn’t want to date me again. I had overcome my shyness enough to ask them out; I was warm, outgoing, curious, and engaging on the date, and yet they didn’t seem to want more. It made no sense to me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But now that I understand the opposite of nice, it’s clear to me. Without consciously knowing it, I was hiding that rough stone with the unpolished edges, hiding my authentic self. I smoothed it over so many times that what I revealed was a soft, watered-down version of myself. This smoothing most likely showed up in smiling more than I normally do, being too quick to laugh, agreeing too much with everything, and not showing any dislike or preferences about anything. Everything is great. Let me put on this nice show for you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This comes from a deep fear that if I was to simply reveal who I really am, rough edges and all, that others would be repelled. The niceness created an invisible barrier between me and these women that blocks true connection, and thus attraction. I did this to avoid rejection and stay safe. Safe and alone.</p>
