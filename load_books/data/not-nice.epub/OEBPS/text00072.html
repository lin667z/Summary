<h4 class="Header-02">Your Inner Dream Team: Id, Ego, Superego</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Alright. It’s time to get Freudian on yo ass. Back in the day, Sigmund Freud spent large amounts of time speaking with patients who would candidly reveal their deepest secrets, desires, and impulses. It was during the Victorian era, when there were especially strong societal pressures to repress sexuality, vulgarity, aggression, and anything else that was deemed lewd, crude, or otherwise uncivilized.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Freud discovered that while people followed the rules of the society and outwardly seemed docile, pleasant, chivalrous and civilized, inside they were full of all kinds of desires and impulses. It appeared that each person had what Freud referred to as the “Id.” This was a part of people’s psyche that was made up of unrefined and unfiltered instinctual impulses. This includes sexual impulses and desires, and all forms of anger and aggression, including rage, violence, the desire to dominate, and the urge for revenge.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The Id is driven by what Freud called the “pleasure principle.” It wants instant gratification and pleasure, and it wants it now. The Id is not concerned with societal rules, what others will think, and what the impacts of our actions might be. It is raw feeling, desire, and impulse. And it’s inside all of us. Yes, even you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is apparent if you’ve ever spent any amount of time with a three-year-old child. He wants the cookie and he wants it now. If he doesn’t get what he wants, he can feel strong emotions of sadness, frustration, and anger. He gets enraged. He has an urge to break or hit things. Look out little siblings, a storm is coming. No patience, all pleasure.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, the vast majority of humans are not running around immediately gratifying their impulses, raping and pillaging, and generally running amok in society. This is where the Superego comes in. Your Superego is your internal moral police force. It carries all the rules you’ve learned about what it takes to be a good, moral, and respectable person. It knows how you should be. Thou shalt not hit, steal, hurt, take for yourself, disregard others, be offensive, rude, etc.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you feel guilty, that’s Superego at work. <span class="CharOverride-9">How could you do that? That poor person. You just walked over them and took advantage of them by being so direct and forceful with your tone. Bad, bad, bad!</span>
 When you have a million things you “should” do, that’s your Superego doing its thing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, to mediate and manage the whole situation, enter your Ego. This is the part of you that takes into account the impulses of the Id and the commandments of the Superego and tries to figure out how to operate in the world. This part of you knows the reality of the world around you, that you can get in trouble if you act out of line, and so he restrains many of the Id’s impulses. He also knows that if you only did what the Superego wanted and completely cut off the Id that you would go insane or be utterly depressed and miserable. So he brokers deals.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Id sees someone you’re attracted to and says, “Sex. Now!” Superego sees the same situation and says, “Sex out of wedlock is bad,” or “Wanting sex right away makes you promiscuous and bad,” or “Sex without getting to know someone first is hurtful and wrong” (depending on whatever your unique conditioning has taught you). Ego says, “How about we walk over, introduce ourselves, get to know them and see what happens?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you walk towards them, you see an attractive, charming person swoop in and start talking with them first. Id says, “Kill them! Throw your drink on the floor and scream!” Superego says, “Violence is bad and wrong, be nice.” Ego says, “OK, showing any sign of anger or jealousy will reduce your appeal in their eyes. Stay cool. Wait a few minutes until they’re done talking and then move in.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And on and on it goes. All day, every day. Your Ego is hard at work, managing the wide disparity between your Id and Superego.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, what does this trip down Freudian lane have to do with being less nice and more boldly yourself? It turns out quite a bit. Because guess which of these three parts is the biggest proponent of “nice”? That’s right, your Superego. And most nice people are completely identified with their Superego. They think they are that completely nice, loving, generous, gentle, patient, serene, “good” person. Any evidence that creeps into their awareness that shows they might not be is threatening and met with strong internal pressure to shape up, and get back to being good. As a result, the Superego runs the show, attempting to completely deny and eliminate the Id. After all, that’s what a good person does, right? Overcomes her animal impulses and acts like a good and moral person should?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In theory. That’s what we’re taught by well-meaning parents, school, and religious communities. But it doesn’t work in practice. It breaks down, and leads us to be outwardly good and nice, and inwardly a mess. Inside we are tense, anxious, upset, sad, depressed, irritable, uncertain, full of doubt, and full of guilt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s be honest, it’s not really working. We need a new, practical approach that works much better, leads to greater ease, fulfillment, authenticity, and happiness. And don’t worry, this new way actually makes you more free, expressive, loving, generous, and all the other ways you’d want to be as a “good” person in this world. It’s just a very different path to get there.</p>
