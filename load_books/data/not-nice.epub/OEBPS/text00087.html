<h4 class="Header-02">You Get What You Think You Deserve</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">When it comes to social interaction, what do you deserve? This might be an unusual question that you’ve never really asked yourself. But unconsciously you have a set of beliefs that tell you exactly what you deserve. And socially, as with all areas of life, you get what you think you deserve.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Most nice people don’t think they deserve much attention or focus when interacting with others. They tend to keep the conversation focused on the other person, asking them questions, and sharing less about themselves. They don’t want to be an egomaniac or attention hog who just talks about themselves. In fact, being the center of attention is often uncomfortable, even when they’re just talking with one person, let alone a group. It can lead to a squirmy, I’m-on-the-hot-seat-and-want-get-off feeling that causes them to wrap up and stop sharing themselves with others. Enough about <span class="CharOverride-9">me</span>
 , let’s get back to <span class="CharOverride-9">you</span>
 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What would serve you more is to have a healthy expectation of attention in a conversation. This means you think you deserve attention, for others to be present with you, and listen to what you are saying. What you say is significant and it matters, because it’s about you. Even if it’s you simply sharing something you read, or an experience you recently enjoyed in your life. That matters, because you matter.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my Mastermind clients recently shared about a first date she went on. She had been working on her dating confidence for the last several months and was starting to go on more dates, which the group celebrated with her. On this particular date, she said that she was very attracted to him physically, however whenever she shared about herself, he would listen briefly and then bring the conversation back to talking about himself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Did that feel good to you?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No, I didn’t like it,” she replied instantly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I knew this would be the answer, because it doesn’t feel good to anyone. We all want to receive attention when we’re sharing, we all want to feel like we matter. Yet here’s the fascinating part. She didn’t enjoy the conversation that much, but she wanted to go out with him again, and she was anxious about whether he would follow up or not. Have you ever been in that situation? I know I have. And it baffles our conscious minds. <span class="CharOverride-9">Why do I care so much about whether this person calls me back? I’m not even that into them!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yet we get what we think we deserve. On some level, my client still believes she doesn’t deserve full attention, focus, and interest from a man she is attracted to. On some level she still believes she’s not worthy of it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is something I really get. For years, whenever I was speaking with someone and they didn’t seem interested, I would instantly conclude it was because whatever I was talking about wasn’t interesting. The topic was stupid, or I was a boring and unengaging person. I wasn’t good enough to keep their attention and I didn’t deserve it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Regardless of how long you’ve felt this way, now is the time to let it go. Raise your standard. You do deserve it. What you want to say and share matters. It is interesting. Own it. Expect more. Not in some crazy entitled prima donna way. In a healthy way that allows you to create the relationships that you really want, the ones that really nourish you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, the next time you’re speaking with someone and they don’t seem that interested in you and what you’re sharing, pound the table with your first and loudly shout, “Do you know who I am?!” No, I’m kidding. Actually, just notice it. Acknowledge that it’s happening and notice that it doesn’t feel good to you. Remind yourself you deserve better than this and act accordingly. Maybe you end the conversation and go talk with someone else. Maybe you decide not to pursue a second date even though he or she was really hot. There are tons of amazing, attractive, compelling people out there. Find one that excites you and gives you the attention that you deserve.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Side note: There is one caveat here. If virtually everyone you talk with seems disinterested, most likely you are doing something that is creating that response in others. It doesn’t mean you’re a boring person, it means there is some snag in your communication style that is blocking your connection with others. If that’s the case, I strongly urge you to explore the resources I mentioned at the beginning of this section so you can rapidly identify and change that pattern.</p>
