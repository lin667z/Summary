<h4 class="Header-02">If Only I Were Good</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">“Yes, I’m doing that,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was about twenty minutes into a session with a client and I had just pointed out that she was being expressive and authentic around one group of people (certain doctors and nurses in the hospital), but not around another group of people (senior consultants and doctors who she viewed as “more senior” than herself).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Because I’m afraid they won’t like me. They’ll think it’s inappropriate if I treat them like this,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So to avoid that potential judgment, you’re showing up differently. How do you act around them?” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m very respectful, polite. I keep it very professional, just talk about the cases, no chitchat. I don’t smile or make jokes as much. I’m very serious and much nicer,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I see. So the plan is that if you’re serious, professional, and nice, then you’ll be seen as appropriate and they will then like you,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yes.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Is it working?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No!” she said quickly. “It’s not. They don’t get upset with me, but I don’t think they really like me either. And I feel anxious inside. I’m not being my real self around them. I’m not showing by best self. I can be way more assertive, warm, and funny. I think if they saw these things they would like me more…” She paused for a moment, then continued, “it’s like I’m following all the rules, but I’m miserable.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Indeed she was. As was I, for many years. I played by all the rules that I had in my mind, that I assumed everyone in the world agreed upon. I believed that if I pushed myself hard enough, if I were just “good” enough, then I would get love and respect from others, relationships, success, and finally be able to love myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unfortunately, it never happened. Partly because my rules were so numerous and often conflicting. If one rule says, “Don’t ever hurt anyone’s feelings, ever,” you’re already screwed. It’s completely unobtainable, because if you’re interacting with humans, at some point, someone is going to have some hurt feelings around you. Even if you never intentionally did this, and took extra care to avoid it, it will happen. I promise you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can cause pain in another person by giving them a compliment. Seriously. Just recently, a man in my mastermind program brought up this exact point. He was at a party with his wife and he was having a great time. He was making great strides in his social confidence progress and was really enjoying himself, mingling with the people there (which is something he would have avoided like the plague in the past). Instead, he was starting conversations, flowing freely, and lacking self-consciousness. He was on cloud nine.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, just as he and his wife were getting their coats on and about to leave, the hostess approached them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I just have to say,” she said, “that you two are the cutest couple here.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My client instantly felt uncomfortable and became flustered. “Uh, mm, thanks,” he said, awkwardly. According to his report in the mastermind, he then proceeded to just keep talking, not even aware of what he was saying. It triggered so much anxiety and discomfort that he talked and talked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After he left he felt self-conscious and embarrassed. He criticized himself on the way home about how foolish he looked, and how he should have just said “thank you” and left it at that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In short, that compliment produced way more pain than it did pleasure. Therefore, that hostess was a bad person. At least according the The Rules.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So not only is the “Don’t hurt anyone’s feelings ever” an unobtainable rule, but what if you have another rule that says, “I should be honest and assertive with people all the time.” This leads to all kinds of confusing experiences where your two rules send opposite commands: <span class="CharOverride-9">Say it, no don’t say it, but you have to say it, but I’m bad if I say it…</span>
 It’s like a robot that has two conflicting commands, working itself up into a tizzy until its circuits fry.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And that’s pretty much what happens. You feel anxious, self-critical, and depressed. It also makes relationships, friendships, and all sorts of interactions feel restricting and painful. You feel trapped. And you think it’s the other people, you think it’s your workplace, or your boss, or your girlfriend, or husband, or parents, or someone. But it’s you. <span class="CharOverride-10">The rules are inside of you. You are the one writing them, then following them.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And it’s time to break free.</p>
