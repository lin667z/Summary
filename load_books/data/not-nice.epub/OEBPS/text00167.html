<h4 class="Header-02">The Keychain</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">It was late September and I was in Carmel, California, for the wedding of my best friend from childhood. I was outside with several of the groomsmen, who all happened to be guys I went to high school with. I loved each of them, and had so many fond memories of being together. My social anxiety was at its peak in high school and college, and the only place I felt relaxed and comfortable during those years was with my brother and these friends. They were like family to me and I love all of them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As we’re waiting around for the rehearsal, my friend Eddie approaches me and the groom’s brother, Matt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hey!” He says, enthusiastically. “I have something for you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small rectangular object and hands it to me. I take it in my fingers, unsure of what it is. Upon a closer look, I instantly recognize it. It’s a key chain with an image inside. It was a keepsake from a punk show we went to in high school. There on the small, blown out image, underneath the scratched plastic of the key chain, you could see me, Eddie, Chris (the groom), and his brother JC, all wearing white t-shirts and strikingly similar sunglasses, smiling in the bright sun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Wow, haha!” I said. “I remember this. The <span class="CharOverride-9">Warped Tour</span>
 in Santa Barbara. We saw <span class="CharOverride-9">NOFX</span>
 there. It was awesome.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I paused for a moment, reminiscing about the sweet memory. Then handed the keychain back to Eddie.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That’s cool, thanks for showing that to me.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No, it’s for you,” Eddie said. “You can keep it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No thanks,” I replied without hesitation. My tone was warm and friendly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Eddie took it back, paused for a minute, and then turned towards Matt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“You want this?” he asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Sure!” Matt said, seemingly excited to get the nostalgic item.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was telling this story a few days later to a client, who happened to have a huge fear of saying no to anyone, for any reason.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why didn’t you just take it?” she asked. “You could always have just gotten rid of it later. That way you wouldn’t have offended him.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m not sure I actually offended him,” I said. “He didn’t seem too perturbed. Besides, my goal is to be authentic and say yes when I want to say yes, and no when I want to say no.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yes, but why didn’t you want it?” she pressed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“We had just moved earlier that year and I had a goal of getting rid of fifty percent of our belongings. I feel better owning fewer things and having more open space. I don’t really keep drawers of items and keepsakes and such.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why didn’t you tell him that?” she asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I would have, if he had asked or seemed significantly hurt or upset. But often times saying no can just be a simple exchange of information and no one’s feelings are hurt. Hence, no explanation is needed.”</p>
