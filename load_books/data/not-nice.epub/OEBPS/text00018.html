<h4 class="Header-02">Good Boys And Girls</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">When you think back to your childhood, what messages about being nice did you receive? Sometimes they were direct messages, like: <span class="CharOverride-9">If you don’t have anything nice to say, then don’t say anything at all.</span>
 Other times they were indirect, like a certain look your dad would give you if you disobeyed him. A look that filled you with fear and got you in line fast.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A great way to uncover more is to start by picking one parent. Typically, the parent whose love you craved the most had the biggest impact on you—not necessarily the one whose love you <span class="CharOverride-9">received</span>
 the most, but the one you <span class="CharOverride-9">craved</span>
 the most.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you grew up with grandparents or extended family members other than your parents, pick from the people who raised you. Do you have that parent or person in mind now? Good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How did you need to be in order for them to love you? How did you need to think, feel, and behave? Who did you need to be for them?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, as a kid, I craved my dad’s love most. To receive that love, I felt like I needed to be obedient, athletic, quick to learn, avoid bothering him when he was upset, and not too emotional.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment right now to make a list of the first things that come to your mind, without filtering it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Got it? Good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My next question is this: how could you <span class="CharOverride-9">never</span>
 be around this parent? What brought on their disapproval?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment to come up with this list now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you may discover, it often is just the opposite of your first list. For example, I felt like I could not be defiant, physically weak, poor at sports, slow to learn, outspoken, or have strong feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What did you come up with? Every time I do this exercise, I’m surprised by how much these simple lists have dictated many choices I’ve made in my life. This conditioning is powerful, greatly influences us, and is mostly unconscious. Until you do an exercise like this.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In my in-depth video training program, Confidence Unleashed, I refer to this as your “Good Boy” or “Good Girl” list. This is your template of how you need to be in order to be “good” (or worthy of love).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For many people, their Good Person list includes being agreeable, saying yes, giving to others, being quiet, being humble, and other versions of polite, obedient, and non-offensive. It also can include succeeding, winning, getting things on their first try, never failing, and other demands for rapid and total achievement in all things they try. For some it demands they always feel happy, upbeat, positive, and have a “good attitude.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The Bad Boy/Bad Girl list usually includes being outspoken, saying no to others, being aggressive, being selfish, challenging people, saying what you want, being honest, and even being authentic, vulnerable, or real. For many, failing, not being the best, and feelings such as sadness, anger, and fear are all unacceptable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are you noticing about your lists? What are you discovering about yourself? What memories does this exercise bring up?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’d suggest you let yourself reflect on this over the next day or two. If memories that you haven’t thought of in a while come up, don’t ignore them. Instead, pay attention to the messages being conveyed in those memories. How were you being conditioned? The more you see that being nice is just a pattern you learned to get love and avoid pain, the more quickly you can recondition yourself and break free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At this point, you may have questions about how you could possibly receive love from others if you didn’t live up to the Good List and sometimes did things on the Bad List. As you’ll see in the pages to come, the love and connection you deeply crave doesn’t come from pleasing others and hiding all your perceived flaws. It actually comes from boldly being yourself, saying what you actually think and feel, and sharing yourself with the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may also want to reflect on the questions above while focusing on your other parent. How did you need to be for him or her? Who could you never be?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This kind of reflection can produce powerful insights into what has been driving your thoughts, feelings, and actions for many years. It’s also part of the process of liberating yourself so you can become all of who you are, which leads to being more powerful, alive, vibrant, attractive, and successful.</p>
