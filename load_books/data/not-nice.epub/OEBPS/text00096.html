<h4 class="Header-02">Meetings: Command the Room</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Once you give yourself permission to ask questions and really start to acknowledge the value of your perspective, you&apos;ll naturally start speaking up more in meetings. The next level is to command the room.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This doesn&apos;t require being the highest level of authority in the room or being the boss. It also doesn&apos;t have to come across as condescending or like you think you&apos;re better than others. Rather, it’s a natural way to communicate when you believe in yourself and aren&apos;t focused on harvesting approval and pleasing everybody. Instead, you say what you think and you stand behind what you say.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The more you practice this, the more natural it will become. It will simply be what you do and how you communicate. It will become who you are and how you show up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to command the room, you need to really internalize the mindsets presented in this book: letting go of the need for approval, taking care of others, and feeling overly responsible for their feelings and reactions. That might mean going back and reading those chapters again, and practicing all the suggestions and exercises. If you read through those sections passively without doing the exercises, you may have an intellectual understanding, but that’s very different from generating massive power to step up and be who you are. That only comes from action.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s cover two key abilities you must have in order to be able to command the room. You must be able to hold the center of attention without freaking out or collapsing in upon yourself, and you must be able to handle interrupting others and being interrupted.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you want to accelerate in your career and go beyond a basic technical position, you will most likely need to manage others, lead, and run meetings. If you run your own business and you want to expand beyond a solo-shop where you do everything yourself, you will need to lead and manage others. To reach any level of significant influence, impact, and income, you must be able to be the center of attention and handle interruptions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While it’s most essential in your career, developing these two skills will serve you greatly in your personal life as well. Being the center of attention allows you to share a story at a dinner party, give a toast at a wedding, or approach a group of strangers to initiate a conversation. Being able to interrupt radically improves your social experience, prevents you from getting stuck in one-sided conversations that drain you of energy, and helps you guide conversations to be more fun, engaging, or productive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In short, you want these skills. You <span class="CharOverride-9">need</span>
 these skills. And it’s worth facing the discomfort of learning how to build them, as they will serve you for a lifetime.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Holding Court</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Back in the day, as in ye olden times, royalty would gather their loyal dukes and whatnot and hold court. This term later evolved to mean being surrounded by and commanding the attention of admirers, subordinates, or hangers-on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That&apos;s what you want to do. As you become less nice, and less concerned with how every single person will respond to every single thing you say, you can command the center of attention more easily.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The reason this is difficult for most people is because they have low self-esteem and have many things about themselves they dislike or think are inadequate. When others pay attention to them, they imagine they’re being criticized and judged for their shameful inadequacy. Combine this with a hefty dose of approval seeking and fear of upsetting others and you find yourself nowhere near the center of attention, ever.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But this negatively impacts your life in multiple ways. Without being the center of attention, you can never command a meeting, give a powerful presentation, or do anything in the business world that could produce significant results. Even when it comes to socializing and dating, if you can&apos;t be the center of attention, then you can&apos;t tell stories, speak up in a group, or walk over to people you don&apos;t know and jump into the conversation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It&apos;s time to start thinking of speaking up in work settings as if you are holding court. Start by paying attention to people who already do it and study them. How do they hold the center of attention, how do they speak, how do they look at others? Instead of instantly putting up some false barrier between you and them, thinking <span class="CharOverride-9">I could never do that</span>
 , pay attention to what you can emulate.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, combine your newfound certainty tone with stepping up and taking some risks in a few meetings. Own it. What if you were The King? The Queen? How would you speak to your subjects? Would you have any qualms about taking time or space? Of course not, you&apos;re the ruler and you are surrounded by your loyal subjects.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This isn&apos;t some narcissistic stance where we think we’re better than everyone else. It&apos;s just a playful way to bring our self-esteem back up to where it should be–where it originally started when we were young: knowing you are awesome.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s you giving yourself permission to hold the floor and own the room. <span class="CharOverride-9">Yes, I want your attention. It’s important for you to give it to me right now. Of course, my idea is worth sharing; it&apos;s my idea. Of course, it&apos;s worth contributing this, I created it. Of course, they need to hear this, it&apos;s important!</span>
 This healthy perception of your value allows you to speak up and command the attention of the room.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">During one of my live events, after a segment where participants went out in the world to practice what they were learning, one client shared this: “As I walked down the street, I felt like I was the king out on a stroll and I was lovingly looking at all my loyal subjects.” The room laughed in surprise and delight at this fun image. It was especially significant for him, because he had spent decades uncomfortable meeting new people and avoiding eye contact with all but a few that he knew well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Make a mini-project out of studying how people hold court. Notice it at work, and any time you see it on TV, at a party, or anywhere else in the world. Watch the person’s face, their body language, and listen to their tone. Then mimic that in your own life until it becomes familiar and a part of who you are.</p>
