<h4 class="Header-02">Play Doctor with Me</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Zaim, my three-year-old son, loves to play doctor with his daddy. The game has a set script that he wants to follow each time:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">First, Teddy is the patient. He has been massively wounded by Scodger Digit, the giant pretend purple T-Rex who only hurts stuffed animals (not real animals, obviously, because he’s pretend).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Teddy is transported to the doctor by another stuffed animal who has a car. Zaim has to ask the animal how many people he can hold in his car. If it’s a lot, he exclaims, “Wow! That’s a lot!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When Teddy arrives to the doctor’s office, Zaim says to Dr. T-Rex, “I have something to tell you…” pausing for dramatic effect. Then he exclaims, “Scodger Digit!!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Upon hearing the name of his nemesis rival, Dr. T-Rex goes into a rage. He hates how Scodger Digit is giving T-Rex a bad reputation everywhere since he’s a doctor trying to help people out (see how elaborate this game gets?).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In any case, it goes on from there, with a very specific sequence of healing the patient, poking him, operating on him while he’s awake with no anesthesia, and then doing it again with another patient. Or it can just devolve into Teddy and T-Rex fighting each other with the medical tools.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sounds sweet, doesn’t it? It is. It’s an adorable little game and a great way to bond with my little boy. And it has happened about 785 times so far.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The problem is not the game. It’s that I felt that I had to say “yes” whenever he asked me. This pressure came from my internal desire to be a “good dad.” I remember how much I longed for my dad to slow down and pay full attention to me when I was a boy. I remember how much I loved playing games with him, including chess and other strategy games.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I also read a story in a parenting book by Jon Kabat-Zinn, the well-known mindfulness teacher, which encouraged parents to be patient with the repetition that children crave. In his book, <span class="CharOverride-9">Everyday Blessings</span>
 , he shares a story about reading <span class="CharOverride-9">Jack and the Beanstalk</span>
 to his son over and over again. By shifting his focus and becoming even more present he was able to keep repeating the story and enjoy being with his son. It was inspiring and sweet. And for me it wasn’t working so well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead of feeling everyday-blessed I was feeling everyday-trapped. Remember the Resentment Formula from the “Be More Selfish” chapter? That’s what was happening to me. I didn’t want to play doctor, but I would say yes, and then I would feel irritated and unhappy. Then I would force myself to be in the moment and try to enjoy myself. Sometimes I would try to add new elements to change the script, but that was met with fierce resistance. So, I went through the same routine again and again. Miserable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then, I had an idea... I could just say “no.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What?! Crazy, I know. But how about that?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead of agreeing to play doctor when I didn’t want to, I could simply say no. And since I still wanted to play with Zaim, I could simply offer to do something else. That evening, when I walked into the house after work and Zaim ran up to me shouting, “Daddeeeeee! Play doctor with me!” I simply said, “No... Hey, let’s play the knock down game instead!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Ok!” he said, seemingly unfazed by the rejection of his request. He was into the knock-down game as well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So simple. It may sound stupid-obvious from the outside. But all throughout the day there are little things we feel like we “have” to do for some reason. We don’t want to disappoint, or upset, or hurt someone. We think saying no or asking for something makes us pushy, stubborn, unhelpful, or the old vague favorite: “bad.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Find the places in your life where you can make simple shifts just like this one. Pay attention to the resistance and resentment you feel; it’s guiding you towards exactly what would serve you best. Then, you simply have to claim it.</p>
