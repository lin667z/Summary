<h4 class="Header-02">The List</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Now you’re going to create a list of the main rules that affect you on a daily basis. There is a very easy way to discover these rules because they all use the exact same word: should.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I will ask you prompting questions about each of the core areas of your life. For each one, write out a list of all the ways your mind tells you that you should or should not be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example: How should you be in conversations with others? What should you not do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should not interrupt someone when they’re talking.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I shouldn’t look away when someone is talking.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I shouldn’t change the subject.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should convey that I’m interested in them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should ask questions to show I’m interested.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Make sense? This is just a short sample of your potential rule list for conversations. Good God, this area is dominated by our rules! Every client I work with who struggles with conversation confidence has dozens of rules for how they should be in every interaction. On top of that, the rules are very serious and if you break them it’s a big deal. It’s horribly offensive, people hate you, you’re an asshole, and you die a miserable lonely death in a basement apartment somewhere.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Enough of all this nonsense. Let’s get free. Ready to make your list? I’ll ask you some questions about different areas of your life, and then you come up with a list for each area. Some areas will have a short list of rules, and some areas will have a much longer list.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Below all these questions, I have an example of a list of my rules from about seven years ago, when I was doing a deep dive into this stuff. You can review that if you’re unsure, or if you just want to see how messed up I am. I mean was. <span class="CharOverride-9">Was</span>
 . I’m perfect now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Relationships:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are you in a romantic relationship right now? If not, think back to the last one. If you’ve never been in one, imagine being in one now. Think about daily life and how you relate to your girlfriend, boyfriend, spouse, or partner. What are some of the areas of conflict, frustration, or challenge that arise? Perhaps you have discussions or fights about these things. Or, perhaps you keep these things inside, and only you know about certain complaints, frustrations, or challenges. As you reflect on your relationship, ask yourself these questions:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should I be in in my relationship?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should I do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should I <span class="CharOverride-9">never</span>
 do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What’s OK, and what’s not OK for me to do, think, and feel?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then write out a list of your shoulds in this area. Do that now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you are stuck or unsure, you can refer to my list below to get some ideas. If you are surprised by how many rules you found, that’s a good thing. The more rules, and the more tough they are to follow, the more restricted your life is. Discovering them is a huge step toward breaking free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, let’s expand beyond romantic relationships. Take a moment to reflect on these questions, and then add more to your list of shoulds:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be as a son or daughter?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you have children, how should you be as a parent? (This list can be a doozy!)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be around colleagues and co-workers?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How about strangers?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a few minutes to write out your shoulds about your relationships now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Conversations:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It might seem strange to have a category just for conversations since we covered relationships. However, given my focus on social anxiety over the last fifteen years, I’ve found that most people have a ton of rules around exactly how they should be in conversations. These can make conversations confining, boring, draining, or oppressive experiences that leave us feeling anxious, dissatisfied, and dreading more. This is why it’s important to uncover the exact rules you have in conversations as well; so, you can make the experience of talking and connecting with others easy, enjoyable, spontaneous, and fun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment to think about all the different kinds of conversations you have–with friends, coworkers, acquaintances, business associates, and strangers.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be in conversations with others?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are you supposed to do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are you supposed to never do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Write this list of shoulds now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Work &amp; Business:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Think of all the things you do during the day at work. The colleagues you interact with, the projects and tasks you focus on, and customers or clients you might deal with. As you imagine going through your workday, what do you notice about your rules?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be at work?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What activities and tasks should you be doing?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be doing things?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are you doing enough?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are things you shouldn’t be doing?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Make your list of work rules now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Sex:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is another area with many hidden rules. When people refer to “sexual hang-ups,” they are often referring to places we’re uncomfortable because we have unconscious rules that tell us certain things are bad or unacceptable. These rules can create shame around our desires, and tension and inhibition during sex.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Think back to some of your sexual experiences, especially moments when you felt tense, uncomfortable, or ashamed. I know it’s not pleasant, but this is powerfully healing because you are uncovering the rules that made you feel that way. What were you saying to yourself at the time?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be during sex?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should you be able to do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should happen?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should never happen?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What’s OK, and what’s not OK?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Money:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ahh, sex and money. What everyone wants more of, right? Yet, we have so many rules in both areas that create great amounts of suffering, regardless of how much we get. Take a few moments to think about your relationship with money. How do you feel when you think about the topic? Happy, excited, energized? Tense, anxious, or scared? Sad or down? Frustrated or dissatisfied? Ashamed? Whatever you feel is a clue to what your rules are.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be with money?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should you be doing more of?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should you be doing less of?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How much should be earning?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should you be able to do in this area?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Health:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Health, including our food choices, exercise habits, and appearance, is a hot button for rules. We have so many of them, and they are often all-or-nothing, extreme, conflicting, or distorted. This can lead to large amounts of shame, guilt, judgment, and fear about our bodies, our appearance, our diets, and everything else health related. Let’s bring out all these rules into the light of your awareness.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be with your health and self-care?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should your body look like?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How much should you weigh?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How should you be eating?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What should you never do?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">---</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">OK! That’s enough. Whew, so many rules. So much inner policing and control going on. How exhausting.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Were you surprised by how many there are? When I do this exercise, I’m always shocked at how many rules I have for myself. No wonder I feel tense and confined in this situation. I am!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here, as promised, is my list of rules from some years back. I’ve done this exercise numerous times. Each time it changes as I grow and evolve. This one is from seven years ago, before I’d met Candace or had my children.</p>

<p class="body-paragraph">

</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never do things people could disapprove of.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be more ambitious, driven.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be creating a website and coaching business in my spare time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should keep track of every client and document at work.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be completely knowledgeable and competent.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never make a mistake.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-15">Sexual Activities</span>

<p class="body-paragraph">I should be totally uninhibited to say and do whatever I want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be more comfortable talking dirty.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be more masculine, direct, and assertive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be the perfect lover.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should always bring her to orgasm (before myself).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should always get and maintain an erection.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should always be able to orgasm.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-15">Money and Finances</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should spend less money.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should earn more money.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should eat out less.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should have better understanding of investments and finance.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should understand my taxes better.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should know what I’m spending and where and have a clear, precise budget.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-15">Health &amp; Self-Care</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never use porn.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never smoke tobacco.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should only use pot once every two weeks, tops.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should have better posture.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should stretch more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should never eat fast food or junk food.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should eat more greens.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should cook my own dinners.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should be more fit and muscular.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do we do with this fine list of inner laws? Burn it. Free yourself and live with no rules! No, I’m kidding. I have no idea what you wrote down. Perhaps you had: “I should never hit my child.” That’s a rule worth keeping. You may still agree with some of your rules, those that are actually in line with your values and how you want to be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Other rules might seem oppressive and extreme. If you ask why you should follow that rule, and your mind says, <span class="CharOverride-9">Because you should. To disobey would be bad and wrong.</span>
 That, as you’ll see in Part III, is not sufficient reason to keep a rule. It has to fit with who you are and come from your values, not some old programming unconsciously passed down from your parents, who got it from their parents, and so on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For now, you’re just going to do one more thing with this list. Go through and mark the rules that really reflect your core values. Ones that affirm who you are and how you want to be. Mark those with a star or a smiley face.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, go through and look for the rules that are crushing you. The ones that keep you feeling confined, inadequate, guilty, and stuck. The ones that are life restricting and preventing you from being your full, free, alive self. Mark those suckers with an unhappy face. We’ll get back to them soon.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So now, you have the core distinction between healthy guilt and destructive guilt. Healthy guilt comes from your true values and keeps you on track. Destructive guilt comes from faulty rules that you don’t really agree with, but accepted when you were young. Making this list helps you determine which rules are which.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Destructive guilt can also occur when you break one of your values. Instead of healthy guilt kicking in to steer you in the right direction, destructive guilt swoops down and smashes you, telling you what a rotten person you are. In this case, the reason the guilt turned sour is because of its intensity, duration, and global assessment of you as a terrible father, or mother, or friend, or boss. This intense self-attack doesn’t help you reaffirm your values and course-correct, it diminishes your self-esteem and makes you less likely to make lasting positive changes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you read the second part of this book, you will strengthen your own viewpoints, beliefs, and self-esteem. This will allow you to combat this guilt and not fall victim to it so easily. You will also discover dozens of new rules that will liberate you and help you create healthy, satisfying relationships. Then, in Part III, you will further define your own rules and release old ones that don’t serve you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But before we leave this discussion of guilt, there is one important thing to talk about. This is a pattern that causes endless guilt, makes it insanely difficult to say no, ask for what you want, speak up for yourself, or do much of anything without feeling like a bad person. It’s the pattern of taking too much responsibility for other people’s feelings.</p>
