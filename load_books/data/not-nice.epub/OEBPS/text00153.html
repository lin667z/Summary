<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Let&apos;s take a moment to discover what you being 100% you actually means. I&apos;ve found for myself that simply thinking about the words “one hundred percent me” starts to impact my thoughts and actions. But let&apos;s give it more clarity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To start, let me ask you, what do you think 100% you is? If you gave yourself complete permission to be the real you in all settings — work, with family, as a parent, as a son or daughter, when meeting new people, with friends, by yourself in the woods — what would you do? How would you act? How would you be?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What are the first words, phrases, or images that pop into your mind? Do you see certain scenes at work or with your spouse playing out in your mind? Take a few minutes and watch and hear anything that comes out of your mind and heart when you ask these questions. These messages just might be your long-lost, buried, authentic self.</p>
