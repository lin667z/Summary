<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Remember that list of rules of you came up with way back in Chapter 3? Your list of shoulds? Take a moment now to find that list. And if you didn’t make it at the time… SHAME. SHAME. SHAME. You’ve just broken a terrible rule. That’s OK though, because you can always flip back to Chapter 3, review that section (called “The List”), and create it right now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a few minutes to read through your list. Do you still believe all of these rules? Perhaps your reaction to some of them has changed since reading through this book and coming up with your bill of rights. If so, and you’re feeling more liberated, that is fantastic. Because ultimately, if we’re trying to live by fifty oppressive rules, life is generally miserable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you look at your list, I want to ask you some questions. Where did these come from? Where did you learn them? Did <span class="CharOverride-9">any</span>
 of them <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 come from you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In Chapter 3 I had you mark the ones that caused the most problems in your life with an unhappy face. And if you didn’t do that part, no worries, just do it now. Go through and mark each rule that causes you to feel bad about yourself on a regular basis with an unhappy face.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For each rule marked in this way, ask yourself, “Where did I learn this?” The answer might come right away, or it may be something you recall later, when you’re not even actively thinking about it. You can reflect on what you learned from your parents, since this is a major source of many of our rules. As you do so, think about what they told you directly, but also what you saw them do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, let’s say one of your old rules is, “I should never do anything that hurts anybody’s feelings.” Maybe your parents didn’t sit you down and say to you, “Don’t ever hurt anybody’s feelings. Ever.” (Although some people’s parents do pretty much exactly this.) Instead, you may have seen the disapproval and upset they expressed when you did do something that upset someone else. Or you may have witnessed how worried they were about upsetting others, and how timidly they moved through the world. This modeling is one of the most influential ways we learned from our parents.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You don’t need to pinpoint an exact source. In fact, even doing so, might not instantly free you from that rule. But just engaging in the process of examining, “Where did I learn this rule anyway?” already begins to shift something in your mind.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It shows that you did indeed learn this rule. It isn’t some objective truth passed down from the beginning of time through all humans everywhere. It’s made up. Maybe by your mom, or her mom, or her mom’s mom. Maybe it’s been unconsciously passed down for generations, completely unexamined. Maybe you learned it from some kids in school when you were small. They were following the rule because their parents did. Who knows?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The liberation here comes from seeing that anything that was learned can be unlearned. It can be changed. And changing your rules is exactly what we’re here to do.</p>
