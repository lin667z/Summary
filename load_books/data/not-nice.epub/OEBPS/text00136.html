<span class="CharOverride-9">The body isn’t used to the 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th rep with a certain weight. That’s what makes the body grow: going through this pain barrier. Experiencing pain and aching in your muscles and then just going on and on and on… That’s what divides one who is a champion from someone who’s not a champion. If you can go through this pain barrier you can become a champion. If you can’t, then forget it. That’s what most people lack – the guts. The guts to go through and say, I don’t care what happens. I might fall down. I have no fear of fainting in the gym. I know it could happen. I threw up many times while working out, but it doesn’t matter. It’s all worth it.</span>

<p class="body-paragraph">Ice showers. This was the first thing I thought of as I began intentionally seeking out discomfort. I’d heard about taking cold showers for a long time, and had never really done it more than a handful of times, always finding it miserable. Miserable you say? I’m in!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I made a commitment to take a one-minute cold shower every day. I ended up on a routine of one minute hot, one minute as cold as our water would go (which is pretty cold, especially in the winter), one minute hot, one minute cold.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The first day, I noticed I felt nervous before the shower. I anticipated the discomfort and was dreading it. My son Zaim heard me mention taking an “ice shower” and had come into the bathroom to witness the spectacle.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m scared!” I said to him, right before hopping in the shower.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why?” he asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Good question, little Yoda. Why was I scared? I actually had to pause and think about that one. <span class="CharOverride-9">Because it’s going to be so uncomfortable!</span>
 my mind said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But why is that so scary? I wasn’t in any physical danger. As far as I knew, sixty seconds of cold water never killed anybody or permanently damaged them. In fact, research on the subject by Scott Carney, author of <span class="CharOverride-9">What Doesn’t Kill Us</span>
 , suggested cold showers actually strengthening our bodies and immune systems. I didn’t have a good answer, so I just said the truth:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I don’t know.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I got in and began with my minute of sweet, sweet hot water. Delightful. Except for the impending doom. After about fifty seconds, as I reached towards the faucet to turn the dial from the far left to the far right, my heart began to pound. My body was getting geared up for fight or flight. I was fascinated by the level of fear pumping through my veins. And then... ICE.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The freezing cold water shocked my skin. I involuntarily gasped and began breathing rapidly. My body wanted to pull out of the stream of frigid water, but that would defeat the purpose. Then, my clever brain offered an alternative form of escape, which would be to have the water just hit my back, not my chest, armpits, or head, which was more uncomfortable. But discomfort was the name of the game, so I turned around, raised my arms, and let the water hit my warm, tender armpits.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The minute of ice-cold water seemed to take longer than the minute of relaxing hot water. Shocking! But eventually the minute passed and I turned the faucet back to max heat. Sweet relief. I repeated the process once more and the second blast was not as bad as the first. Then, I got out of the shower, feeling wide-awake, energized, and victorious. Who needs coffee?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My original commitment was to do the cold shower once per day for thirty days. Within two days, my body stopped responding with rapid heartbeat and fear. Within two weeks, the cold blasts felt normal and I actually liked the intensity of the experience, and the energy I felt afterward.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My son Zaim even started taking his own ice showers. Like me, he was scared at first.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I want to do the warm water first,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Start with warm water?” I said. “Sounds good.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Then do cold for really short. Cold for four minutes,” he said. He held up four fingers as he said this, showing his newfound power to make number symbols with his hands.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Four minutes?” I exclaimed. “That’s kind of a long time. Do you mean four seconds?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, we did cold for four seconds his first time. Within several days he was going back and forth between hot and cold for longer and longer. In one shower he actually had it on cold for more of the time than he had it on hot. Beast.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Based upon this simple little experiment, I started to ask life-changing questions. <span class="CharOverride-10">Is it possible that we get used to discomfort and then tolerate more of it? Can we actually build our discomfort tolerance muscle?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And, most importantly, is discomfort tolerance transferable from one thing to another? As in, does being able to withstand icy water increase my capacity to resist unhealthy foods, take risks in business, or be more bold and authentic while sharing? There was only one way to find out: more discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For my next feat of masochism, I decided to bring discomfort-building to my diet. I had been working out in earnest for about six months and had noticed increased strength, energy, and sexiness (everybody says so). I was speaking with my personal trainer about how to enhance my body composition, build muscle, and reduce body fat. He gave me a specific ratio of carbohydrates, fat, and protein and had me reduce my total intake by 600 calories per day.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Let’s try this for two weeks and see how your body responds,” he said casually.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sounded simple enough. Except it involved greatly reducing the amounts of the delicious healthy fats I was using to make my meals tasty, like guacamole, almond butter, and olive oil.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In addition, 600 hundred calories is uncomfortable. I was hungry much of the day. Hungry, fewer yummy fats, more vegetables, and tons of beans. If the ice shower was a five-pound weight for my discomfort tolerance muscle, these new changes were a twenty-pound weight.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I began to study discomfort even more closely over the next few weeks. What was the sensation of hunger? Where did I feel that discomfort in my body? When I ate simple foods like beans and vegetables, how was that uncomfortable? Where did I feel that discomfort? In my mouth? Elsewhere in my body? In my heart? In my mind?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even more fascinating, I began to see how discomfort has two elements:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">1. The actual uncomfortable sensations in the body.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">2. Mentally labeling something as “discomfort” and then resisting it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The first one can involve many different feelings, depending on the discomfort. It can also be localized, in that I can feel discomfort in one part of my body, and be totally comfortable in another part.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The mental label of discomfort, on the other hand, was global and more static. My mind would say: <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m uncomfortable. I don’t like this. This is bad and it should stop now.</span>
 This would create frustration, unhappiness, and suffering. It would also imply that the experience was wrong and somehow shouldn’t exist. <span class="CharOverride-9">Everything</span>
 is uncomfortable right now, and it’s terrible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My journey into discomfort tolerance continued and still continues to this day, including things like sprinting and extended meditations. I find the entire thing utterly fascinating and see tremendous growth from being willing to intentionally take on things that are uncomfortable. It’s the secret gateway to glory, to achieving anything we want in any area of life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What about you? What’s your relationship to discomfort? When do you avoid it? Do you do so habitually, automatically, without even considering it? Are there times when you seek it out? As you reflect on these questions, let’s look at how increasing your discomfort tolerance will serve you specifically in this process of being less nice and pleasing, and more bold, authentic, and expressive. Let’s explore how being willing to be uncomfortable is the secret to freedom and power.</p>
