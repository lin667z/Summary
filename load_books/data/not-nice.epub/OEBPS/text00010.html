 The Nicest Guy<br/>
You’ll Ever Meet</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I understand the urge to be nice. I know how strong the invisible forces of guilt and fear can be. How difficult it can be to push through this to say what you really want, and express what you really think and feel. I also know how all-consuming the backlash of anxiety and guilt can be after you’ve been more direct, expressive, honest, or assertive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Being the nice guy was part of my identity for a long time. In middle school, I started my quest to get everyone to like me. Not consciously, of course. I didn’t wake up one morning and think to myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">OK, Aziz. Remember! You must get everyone to like you today!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, I just began to worry about how I was viewed by others. <span class="CharOverride-9">Do these people like me? Do they want to be my friend?</span>
 <span class="CharOverride-9">Do girls think I’m cute? Are my shorts the right length? Are my socks the right height?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I wanted to blend in. Be cool. Never be criticized, ridiculed, or rejected. Ever. And so, I began to sculpt my personality to avoid disapproval. If someone who I thought was cool or popular said something funny, I laughed. If people made fun of me for doing something, I stopped doing it. I wore the same clothes everyone else wore, changed the music I listened to, and talked just like everyone else. Boxers are cool and briefs (a.k.a. “tighty whities”) are not? I got rid of them. Alternative music sucks and gangster rap is where it’s at? I bought new CDs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But even though I tried to change everything on the outside, I still had all kinds of uncool things in my house. I remember having my friends Tim and Mark come over to my house in seventh grade, and beforehand I would spend at least fifteen minutes scanning the entire house, hiding anything they could make fun of me for.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I made sure nothing could be used against me. No evidence of me being who I really was and what I really liked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now I understand that this story is typical; most people try to fit in with their peers during adolescence. But this seed of social anxiety and niceness continued to grow in my life. As I became interested in women and dating, I experienced an oppressive layer of fear that prevented me from approaching and chatting with the young women around me. I was so worried about their perception of me, that I avoided most interactions entirely. If I did engage, I felt nervous, silly, and ungrounded.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For years, women didn’t seem attracted to me. My people-pleasing and excessive niceness repelled them, although I didn’t know this at the time. I thought it was because I was not cool enough, strong enough, tall enough. Too ugly, too boring, too nerdy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This negative identity didn’t just exist in my dating life; I perceived myself as socially unskilled, awkward, and unworthy of a large circle of friends. Speaking up, standing out, and being a leader of any form was out of the question.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This continued year after year. I saw my future as confined and limited. I started to talk myself into being OK with settling. <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m just not the kind of guy who’s going to have a relationship, or much success in life.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, one night, I reached a breaking point. I was a senior in college, finishing the time in my life that movies told me was supposed to be a crazy adventure of parties and hot dates. My life was no such thing. Instead, my world was safe, small: going to class, being with friends, and playing lots of video games.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To my credit, I had been slowly working up the courage to approach women I was attracted to. After three to five months mustering the nerve, I’d ask one woman out, confront rejection, and then wait again. I clung to the walls at parties, avoided meeting strangers and creating new connections, and never spoke up in a group of people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After working up my courage to ask yet another woman out and receive another rejection, something inside me snapped. I’ll never forget that night. I came home, totally discouraged, completely hopeless. I felt a heavy sadness, a deep pain of helplessness, resignation, frustration, and depression. This was my life, and I knew there was no way out because I’d tried to change and failed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I got home, the lights were off in the apartment. I assumed my roommate was out, which was unfortunate because I felt so down it would have been nice to hang out with him. Being with Chris always cheered me up. But it looked I was alone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, I made myself some noodles, poured a jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce on top, and headed to my room to do what I did best: play Warcraft III. I loved that game. It was a place where I could forget all my troubles, ignore my bleak, loveless future, and immerse myself in competition, strategy, and play.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I sat at my desk, blowing on my steaming noodles as the game booted up. Then the screen popped up that said: <span class="CharOverride-9">Do you want to log in to Battlenet?</span>
 Battlenet was where you linked up to battle some dude across the country or world in all out warfare. I’d seen that screen ten thousand times.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I dragged my mouse towards the Log In button—and then froze.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I heard a muffled, high-pitch sound coming from somewhere in the apartment. At first, I was scared, but then my mind instantly identified the source: it was a woman laughing. Then I heard a second, deeper voice and realized my roommate was home. He was in his room with his girlfriend, sharing a sweet moment. Her laughter burst through the walls again, this time louder, more joyful.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I sat there, looking at the steam rising from my noodles, listening to her laugh as the Warcraft Orc on the Battlenet Login screen stared back at me. And in that moment, my life changed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I could see and feel my future unfolding before me. The veil of denial had been lifted and I felt the pain of loneliness, longing, inadequacy, and settling that were in store for me if life continued this way. I knew I was not going to experience what I really wanted, that I would miss out on everything that mattered to me, and would die full of regret for a life not fully lived.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This was my rock bottom. Over the years I’ve seen that each client has their own threshold moment when they hit a similar point and they can’t take it any more: they decide to change.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes that moment is provoked by dating, relationships, and love. They’re unable to meet and date the people they want, they endure poor treatment from partners who are only moderately interested, or they watch their marriage go down in flames.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For others, it’s their social life. They can’t take another day of being uncomfortable in their own skin, feeling inauthentic, phony, or forced in their interactions. They’re sick and tired of holding back their opinions, feeling guilty for never doing enough, and being so terrified of upsetting others that they’re sick to their stomach with worry about it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And for some, it’s the moment they get passed over for another big promotion, not because they’re not skilled, but because they’re not “leadership material.” They refuse to stay stuck at the same level as younger talent passes them by simply because others are outspoken and bold with their opinions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I don’t know what your moment was, but if you’re reading this book, I have a strong hunch that you’ve had at least one of these moments that has led you here. In those moments, there is a tremendous amount of pain, but there is also something else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That night there was another feeling awakening inside of me that was stronger than hopelessness. It was like a tidal wave building in force and size. It was a mixture of anger, resistance, and raw energy. It was a complete and total rejection of that bleak existence. It was power.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In that moment, I decided: <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m willing to do whatever it takes.</span>
 I will study whatever I need to, practice whatever I need to, force myself to take action and do anything—no matter how scary or uncomfortable—again and again and again until I break out of this cage and create the life I want. I will not quit. I will not stop.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I didn’t have a name for it then, but I know what it is now. I call it Unstoppable Energy. When I’m speaking to someone, I can tell if they have activated this energy. If they have, then I know success is inevitable; it’s just a matter of time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">With that energy and determination, everything turned around. I made tremendous progress in my confidence and in being less nice. I began studying eBooks and online courses about how to meet women and be more confident. I discovered I could challenge the negative voice in my head and do the opposite of what it said. I made a practice of facing my fears. All of them. One by one.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">With this courage and willingness, life began to open up all around me. I was able to approach a stranger of any age or gender, and start talking with them. I could speak up in groups, make jokes, and seek out public speaking. Women started going out with me. It was mind-blowing and changed the way I perceived reality.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Success, right? Absolutely. Massive success and massive progress. And yet, I soon realized an interesting fact of life. Once you overcome one challenge and break through to the next level, you’re not done. There’s another, higher quality problem waiting for you when you get there, challenging you to step up and grow again. It’s a beautiful quality of life that requires us to continually grow, expand, and become the people we’re meant to be.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For me, that next level challenge was the hardest thing I’ve ever faced.</p>
