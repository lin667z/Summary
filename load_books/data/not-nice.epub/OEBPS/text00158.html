<h4 class="Header-02">Trust Your Intuition</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The key to being your own authority is to first give yourself that permission. It might sound simple, but affirming to yourself: <span class="CharOverride-9">I am choosing to be the authority in my life</span>
 is a powerful decision that will significantly impact what you say, think, feel, and do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Of course, like any decision, in order for it to have a lasting effect it must be an ongoing commitment. Something you do consistently, something you live by. And the best way to do that is to strengthen your sense of intuition, trust in yourself, and trust in something bigger than yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Intuition is a sense of inner knowing that comes from somewhere other than our scared, self-absorbed minds. It is not our survival-based programming that thinks everyone is watching and judging us, and that we need to scramble just to survive. Instead, it’s a much deeper intelligence that is accessed through our bodies, and taps into something much greater than what we think of as ourselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We all have intuition. You have a sense about something. You get the feeling it’s best to go here instead of there. Your gut tells you it’s a bad move to work with a certain person, and so you decline an offer. These are different ways we perceive beyond our conscious, analytic left-brain.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The key to being the authority in your life is to start paying attention to your intuition. Instead of dismissing it as untrustworthy and dangerous, start embracing it as a superior form of guidance, one that is vastly superior to your conscious mind.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Our standard way of operating in the world is generally through our ego, or small self. This part of us is obsessed with how we appear to others, if we’re “getting ahead” and “becoming somebody” and generally doing everything we should be doing so that we survive. This part of our mind thinks it needs to control everything in order to be secure. It’s constantly planning and mentally manipulating the environment, deciding what the best course of action is so that we get what we want, just the way we want it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do I need to say or do to make her want to go out with me? What do I need to do to make him ask me to marry him? How should I do this presentation to make these people agree to my proposal? With these questions as fuel, our minds get to work, weighing variables, calculating all factors, and attempting to control the external world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There is a better way. A way that feels relieving, and gives you a greater sense of authority in your life. And that is to surrender. To trust more and fear less. To float more and steer less.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This capacity is so incredibly valuable, I am actually writing an entire book that will explore it in greater depth. For now, simply begin by tuning into your intuition. Listen to it more, and act on it more, starting now. The more you do this, the more you trust it, and the stronger it becomes. You will start to feel more relaxed self-confidence and trust that emerges from a feeling of being guided in your life. You start to experience the sense of life living through you.</p>
