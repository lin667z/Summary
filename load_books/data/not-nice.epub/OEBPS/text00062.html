<h4 class="Header-02">You Are Not Responsible</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am going to make a bold, simple claim here that might seem extreme or absolute. In fact, it might go against every nice-person bone in your body. You might challenge it, or have lots of questions about it. And that’s all OK. Ready?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">You are not responsible for other people’s feelings.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment to sit with that one. Breathe in and out. Re-read it several times. Try the personal version out: <span class="CharOverride-9">I am not responsible for other people’s feelings.</span>
 I am not responsible for my coworkers’ feelings, my boss’s feelings, my client’s feelings, my friend’s feelings, my wife or husband’s feelings, my kid’s feelings, my mom or dad’s feelings—anyone’s feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How does that feel to say that to yourself? Liberating? Relieving? Perhaps a little uncomfortable or wrong, as if you’re saying something bad or cruel? Whatever is happening inside you, simply slow down, breathe, and notice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We want to slow way down here because our minds, and nice-person programming, can fire up quickly and try to shut down this line of inquiry. Nice Police sirens start wailing and this dissenting, Not-Nice idea must be captured and removed immediately! <span class="CharOverride-9">Bad! Wrong!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, your mind might start sputtering: <span class="CharOverride-9">Wait, wait, what if I just told my kids to shut up, and told Barry at work that I hated his fishing stories and didn’t want to hear them anymore, and told my husband to step up and stop whining so much? I mean, doesn’t what I say and do matter? What if I say critical or hurtful things? I can hurt people. I am responsible!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Or, you may not be having such a strong reaction. You might be calmly thinking that you agree with the statement above. It intellectually makes sense to you. But if you imagine actually being more direct, saying what you really think in specific situations in your life, you feel anxiety or guilt. This might indicate that you intellectually agree that you’re not responsible, but emotionally you feel responsible for the feelings and actions of others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You may think this is part of being a good, kind, thoughtful person. And there is some truth to that. To have the awareness that your friend is self-conscious about the fifteen pounds he’s gained and not say, “Geez, Larry, you’ve really let yourself go. You look like a tired, bloated old man!” is probably a good thing. Some containment of our immediate thoughts and reactions is valuable in relationships. Sometimes, if we’re seething with rage or resentment, it’s best to just be quiet for a few minutes in order to calm down. To not send that text, or email, or storm into the kitchen and start ranting at our partners.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But we can take this too far. Way too far. We can start to assume that <span class="CharOverride-9">anything</span>
 that might lead to a negative reaction or uncomfortable emotion in someone else is inherently wrong and a bad thing to do. So instead of having only more extreme things on our “bad list,” like yelling or harshly criticizing others, we start to add things like: asking for what we want, disagreeing with someone, telling someone we don’t like something or are upset, changing the subject during a conversation, or speaking up for ourselves and challenging someone in a meeting.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Thus, more and more behaviors become taboo. We start to view others as fragile creatures who couldn’t possibly handle any discomfort or upset. We start to view ourselves as extremely powerful demi-gods who can crush the hearts of others with a few simple words. We think to ourselves: <span class="CharOverride-9">I couldn’t possibly do that to her; that would break his heart; he’d be crushed; she couldn’t handle that.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The reality is <span class="CharOverride-9">you</span>
 couldn’t handle that. Or, to use more accurate language, you don’t want to experience your own discomfort about another person having strong feelings. It stirs up too much. It pushes your buttons and you don’t like it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There are two main problem with this approach. First, it will never create lasting and satisfying relationships. This is because close relationships inevitably include discomfort. It’s impossible to not have moments of disappointment, hurt, conflict, sadness, and anger. When we believe a relationship should only involve happy, loving feelings, and never include discomfort, we avoid all topics and conversations that are uncomfortable. This keeps relationships superficial, distant, and lacking passion. We keep everyone at a safe distance. While this might avoid a certain kind of immediate discomfort of going into messy feelings and conversations, we also miss out on the deep joy, happiness, and fulfillment that can come from fully connecting with other humans. We end up feeling deeply alone inside, in spite of having loving people all around us.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The second problem with the avoid discomfort approach is that it keeps you and others stuck as victims of circumstance in life. I discuss the difference between being a Creator in your life and<br/>
being a Victim in more detail in my book <span class="CharOverride-9">The Art of Extraordinary Confidence</span>
 . The short version is Victims see life happening to them. Forces outside of their selves determine how they feel, what they do, and whether or not they have the life they want. <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m mad because my boyfriend’s a jerk. I’m stuck in my job and my boss sucks but I can’t do anything about it.</span>
 That sort of thing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A Creator, on the other hand, realizes this: If my life is not the way I want it to be, then it’s my responsibility to change my attitude and approach to my circumstances. Over time, and through consistent action, I can create the life I want. I won’t get there by blaming others, telling myself that I suck, or any other avoidance maneuver. I must step up, face my fear, and take bold action again and again.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you treat others as fragile, as if they can’t handle the truth about what you want, how you feel, or how you think, you are perceiving them as Victims. When you take responsibility for them, you are keeping them in this Victim stance. <span class="CharOverride-9">How will they feel if I say this? How could I possibly do that to them? They will be so disappointed, and sad, and crushed. They will feel awful, begin drinking heavily, quit their job, and give up on all their hopes and dreams.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are you responsible for how they handle what you say? Are you responsible for how they handle their feelings? Are you responsible for their choices, such as to drink or how they handle themselves in their job? Are you responsible for their happiness? Are you responsible for them having a sense of purpose in life and pursuing their goals and dreams? That’s a heavy burden to bear in any relationship. Managing all of these things for yourself is quite enough, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The truth is, you are not responsible for their lives. They are. And they are not victims that require you to take care of them and do it all for them. Even if the other person sees themselves as a victim, and even tries to get you to agree, do not buy into it. It’s just an illusion. It’s a trick they’ve pulled on themselves and many people around them in their lives. The truth is underneath their stories and excuses they are a powerful force that can make things happen. They are a creator in their lives, just like you and I are.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes, people don’t realize their power until they are tested. Sometimes people need to experience enough pain from living as a victim until they wake up. After six months of drinking, blaming other people, feeling terrible, and struggling, they just might have an epiphany. <span class="CharOverride-9">I can’t take this anymore, this isn’t working!</span>
 They just might get fed up enough and be ready to step up and take responsibility for themselves and their own lives.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The best thing you can do for others is to respect their dignity by seeing them as a powerful creator, no matter how they see themselves. Do not buy into their Victim story. And beware of moving through the world taking responsibility for everyone, assuming they’re all Victims. They are not small children. They are adults. Powerful beings who do not need you to handle everything for them and protect them from all pain. You can let that go.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Right. Now.</p>
