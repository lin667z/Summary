<h4 class="Header-02">How to Handle Being Interrupted</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Jump to your feet, pound the table, and yell, “Sit down and shut up!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Next section.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No, no, that may cause some problems down the line. Instead, let’s discuss how to handle this situation in meetings at work. Once you learn how to do this, however, it extends way beyond just this setting. You can use it with friends, when communicating with your lawyer or accountant, or even with long-winded Uncle Thorpy at Thanksgiving dinner.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you are speaking and someone tries to cut you off or speak over you, it’s important to respond right away. If we consistently stop speaking, quiet down, and let the other person take over, we create a negative pattern that communicates the message: <span class="CharOverride-9">It’s OK to speak over me. I don’t value what I have to say that much anyway. Your viewpoint is probably more important than mine. Besides I don&apos;t really deserve to hold the floor anyway.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is not the message we want to send, and it&apos;s not true. The truth is your opinion matters and what you have to say needs to be heard. As soon as someone jumps in to speak over you, raise your volume just slightly and keep going. If needed, gently raise your hand slightly, palm out, and say, “Hold on a second, Jim, let me finish my point.” Then keep going without hesitation and finish your point. No apology, no hesitation, no niceness. Just you owning the floor while respecting both yourself and others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If the same person continues to interrupt you it can be helpful to call out the pattern. Some people would approach the person one-on-one, but I would call it out right when it&apos;s happening. “I notice you have been speaking up as I&apos;m speaking, Jim. It seems like you&apos;re eager to share your perspective, yet I haven&apos;t finished mine. My preference would be to give each person space to finish their point, then to have a discussion about it. How do you imagine we could solve this problem?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you&apos;re feeling empowered reading this, good! You can absolutely speak to your colleagues and coworkers this way. The sooner you speak up, the better because you will have less of an emotional charge and sound more neutral as you do this. If you’ve been stuffing it down for months, building resentment, your tone will most likely sound harsh or angry. However, if you speak up right away, it will be an assertive statement about what you want in the moment.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s worth mentioning the flip side of stopping someone from interrupting you, and that is interrupting others. I know, it seems ironic to teach you how to stop others from interrupting you and then encourage you to interrupt others. But there is a time in a meeting when you need to tactfully interrupt to share your viewpoint or keep things on track.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to do this skillfully, you must give yourself full permission. Then, carry it out with a solid volume that is slightly louder than the volume at which others are speaking. This will command attention and give you an in. It helps to acknowledge what is being said, or that you are interrupting. “Hey guys, you both are making important points here, and I need to interrupt you to keep us on track in the meeting. We need to determine exact next steps for this week before we complete today.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you can tactfully insert yourself and gracefully block others from interrupting you, you gain an ability to command any meeting. This makes you feel better, reduces resentment, and improves your happiness and performance at work. It also establishes you as a leader, which is important for career advancement and living life on your terms.</p>
