<h4 class="Header-02">The Way Out</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In Chapter 3, we discussed two kinds of guilt: Healthy Guilt and Unhealthy Guilt. Do you remember the difference?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Healthy Guilt is a feeling that arises when you’ve broken a rule that you actually do value and aspire to live by. This guilt is guiding you to get on track and be the kind of person you want to be in the world. It reminds you of what matters most, and inspires you to live in alignment with your values. It’s a positive force for change and is rooted in love.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unhealthy Guilt is a form of punishment and self-attack. We believe we’ve done wrong and must be punished for our sins. If we punish ourselves enough, and suffer sufficiently for our badness, then we’ll have atoned for our transgression. This is a distorted form of logic that is not connected to your values, does not positively influence behavior, and is rooted in fear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So how do you determine which is which? That becomes much easier once you notice the underlying rules that you broke. Look at your list of broken rules and ask yourself: <span class="CharOverride-9">Do I want to live by these rules? Do they reflect my values? Are they realistic? Do they take into account variations in the environment and the fact that I’m a human?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If your answer to these questions is yes, then there is a message in your guilt that is trying to serve you. However — and this is <span class="CharOverride-9">extremely</span>
 important to understand — if you don’t receive the message in the right way, you will get stuck in unhealthy guilt. Let me illustrate with an example.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A few nights ago, it was bedtime in the Gazipura household, and everyone was tired. When an adult gets tired, they want to lie down, relax, and welcome restful slumber. When a little kid gets tired, they draw upon the chaotic energy of the universe, lose all impulse control, and go wackyballs.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On this particular night, Zaim was pushing his younger brother over, refusing to let me brush his teeth, and generally unleashing the beast. I wasn’t handling it well. My patience tank was empty and I went into control mode. My tone became exasperated. My energy became harsh. He wanted to put the cinnamon toothpaste on himself, but I wouldn’t let him because last time he squeezed out a huge wad of toothpaste all over the floor. Then he started crying about not being able to put the toothpaste on and I stood there impatiently waiting for him to finish. Patience tank empty. Compassion tank empty too.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We finally get everyone in to bed and I’m reading him stories to help him fall asleep. He wants a different book that’s not in the bedroom. He wants almond milk. He doesn’t want to be quiet and wants to keep his brother up. My voice becomes sharper as I respond to each of these demands. I don’t yell at him, because I decided long ago that I was never going to yell at my children, but I couldn’t contain my resentment in that moment. Even though I wasn’t saying, “You’re being bad for staying awake and not doing what I said,” out loud, my body language and tone of voice was sending this message loud and clear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then he fell asleep. Thank God. Sweet relief. I passed out next to him on his little toddler bed, as I listened to the sweet sound of his breathing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I awoke the next morning with a pang in my heart. Good morning, guilt. My mind began reflecting on moments from the previous night’s bedtime, seeing all the ways I was being critical and unloving with him. I felt upset with myself, sad about being disconnected from him, and pain in my heart.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Is this Healthy Guilt or Unhealthy Guilt? It all depends on how I receive the message.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The rules I broke were pretty clear. I want to be patient with my sons. I want to be non-reactive to their wild behaviors, and come from a place of connection and love when attempting to influence them. I don’t want to convey the message that they’re bad for being awake, or doing something else that they have little control over.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yep, these are all values I aspire to. So far, so good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But when I tuned into the voice of guilt more closely, I heard this message:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">This is totally unacceptable. How could you do this to your kids? You’re a bad father.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Whoa. That’s intense. And that’s how even healthy guilt can go wrong. Even if you break a rule that you actually aspire to, if you treat yourself with anger, harsh judgment, or self-hate, then you will miss the true message. You will miss the gift in the guilt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">The truth is you cannot beat yourself into being a better person.</span>
 Attacking, judging, punishing, and criticizing yourself will <span class="CharOverride-9">not</span>
 lead to improvement. This is an antiquated and unexamined pattern that many of us run, despite it clearly not working.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead of buying into that self-attack message, I simply brought my awareness to my body and heart. I felt the pain and ache of being angry at and disconnected from Zaim. I felt his pain. I felt my pain. I felt the burning in my heart. And I sent it love. I sent myself love and forgiveness. I sent Zaim love and forgiveness. What a sweet boy doing the best he can. What a sweet dad doing the best he can.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is how you let healthy guilt transform you in positive ways. Get out of your head and into your heart. Feel whatever is there and keep meeting it with love and forgiveness, even if your mind tells you that it’s unforgiveable. It’s not. Everything is, because forgiveness is infinite and always accessible.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes we feel a need to internally proclaim: <span class="CharOverride-9">I will never, ever do this again. From this day forward, I will be perfect!</span>
 We think this is required in order for forgiveness to occur. But we forget that we actually access forgiveness. It’s already available and there, right in this very moment. Our mind just holds the keys and says: <span class="CharOverride-9">You must do A, B, and C before I open this door.</span>
 And one of those requirements is that we have complete and total certainty that we’ll never, ever do it again (whatever your “it” is — getting upset, yelling, overeating or eating junk food, avoiding a scary situation, procrastinating, and a million and one other things that you might attack yourself for).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But here’s the thing. You <span class="CharOverride-9">might</span>
 do it again. In fact, you probably will. Can you forgive yourself anyway? What if your mind has it all wrong, and everything works completely opposite than you think? What if forgiving yourself made it way more likely that you wouldn’t repeat the behavior? And what if attacking yourself and withholding love made you much more likely to repeat the behavior? Guess what, it does!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, no matter what the rule, and how many times you’ve broken it, focus on your heart, feel your body, and meet whatever you find with love and forgiveness.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Love the unlovable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">From this place, you may be able to make new choices, or create a powerful new commitment. Not the, “I promise I’ll never do this again!” mental proclamation. That is a desperate attempt to bargain away the guilt. I mean a decision in your core to do something differently, and then resolving to create a ritual that helps you actually make that change.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, fully feeling the guilt after getting upset with one of my children lead to a deep commitment in me to become less reactive, more patient and more loving. I’m sure every parent alive has made that decision again and again, only to find themselves repeating the same patterns of anger forty-seven minutes later. I’d done this myself many times.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But one day I reached a threshold and I decided to create a powerful commitment. I decided I was going to wake up even earlier and meditate for one hour per day, for the rest of my life. Extreme? Perhaps. Badass? You know it. And so that is what I did, and that is what I have done for the last eight months. Never missed a morning, never missed a day.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sure enough, as I meditated more, my reactivity, irritability, and crankiness reduced radically. My capacity to remain connected and unconditionally love my boys, no matter what their behavior, grew exponentially. And the depth of love and joy that I feel in spending time with them is so much greater that I am shocked at how much I was actually suffering before.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Willpower is not the answer. Commitment is. If you slow down, feel, forgive yourself, and listen for the message in your healthy guilt, it will tell you what you need to do. You’ll see the values you hold dear, and exactly how you want to be in the world. Then, use your willpower, drive, and desire to be your best and create a small habit or ritual that you will do every day. That is the secret to changing all behavior, and putting something in place that guarantees lasting transformation and success. What will your new ritual be?</p>
