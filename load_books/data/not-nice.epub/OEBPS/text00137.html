 ortable Feelings</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you’ve seen throughout this book, the core force keeping us stuck in niceness is fear. But fear of what specifically? While we can have a long list of different scenarios, it really comes down to just two things: We are afraid of feelings that upset others, and uncomfortable feelings in ourselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We are afraid that, due to our actions, other people will feel hurt, sad, disappointed, angry, frustrated, ignored, unloved, or inferior. When other people experience those feelings, this creates discomfort in us, especially if we have a habit of being overly responsible for the feelings of others. We feel responsible, guilty, offensive, bad, selfish, and then hurt, sad, disappointed, angry, frustrated, ignored, unloved, or inferior. Feeling soup.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This interplay between our feelings and theirs can be so murky, and so uncomfortable, that we choose to avoid the whole mess by suppressing our feelings, desires, and most of ourselves. This avoids the messy feeling soup, but it creates other things that are problematic, which we discussed earlier in this book: resentment, anxiety, depression, physical pain, and other life-draining experiences.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, in a sense, you really only have two options:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Discomfort A: Expressing the real you and dealing with the uncomfortable feelings that arise as you do so; Or,</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Discomfort B: Stuffing the real you and dealing with different kinds of uncomfortable feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On the plus side, Discomfort A is temporary and, when you do it consistently, leads to greater and greater levels of power, ease, and freedom. Discomfort B, on the other hand, only compounds. The feelings don’t discharge, and suffering continues to mount. There is no end to this kind of pain, unless you choose to switch over to Discomfort A.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’ll just assume you are on board for trying out Discomfort A, since that is the whole point of this book. If you’re still not ready, take a quick tour back through Chapter 5 about the costs of nice. I think it will inspire you to try something new and to do what it takes to liberate yourself.</p>
