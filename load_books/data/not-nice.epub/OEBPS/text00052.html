Authenticity</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Earlier in this book, we discussed the opposite of nice. As we move forward into the five pillars of becoming less nice, including having boundaries, owning your shadow, speaking up for yourself, being more selfish, and saying no, it’s important to reinforce our primary goal, which is to make you a more free, happy, and healthy person.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The opposite of nice is not to be mean, cruel, harsh, attacking, careless, heartless, or bad. The opposite of nice is power, boldness, and authenticity.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Power is your ability to choose your direction, action, and destiny. It’s your ability to feel equal to those around you, rather than inferior. It’s your ability to stand tall, look people in the eye and be powerful on this planet–a force for good, a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Boldness is your ability to hurdle over risks and dive into the unknown. It’s your ability to break free from the herd, to do what others dare not–not because it’s too dangerous or reckless, but because they are too timid and cling to safety and certainty. It’s your ability to speak up and say what needs to be said when the rest of the room is looking down at their toes and studying their shoelaces. The good news is, even though it’s scary, boldness is always rewarded in the long run. Always.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Authenticity is your ability to be you. It’s funny that we must cultivate this ability. And yet with all our nice-person training and other conditioning, it seems to be so. Authenticity is your ability to look inward and know who you are–what you perceive, what you think, what you feel, what you want, and what you believe. It’s your ability to honor and respect all you see, to love what you see, so that you may boldly bring it forth and share yourself with the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are the true qualities that emerge as we let go of nice. This is what you’re cultivating in the chapters to come. This is the result of your boldness training boot camp. This is the new you coming out to play.</p>
