<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One of the most empowering and liberating benefits of having boundaries is to know where you end and someone else begins. More specifically, you know what is your responsibility and what is someone else’s.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Without boundaries, this distinction is completely unclear and leads to the over-responsibility challenges we discussed in the Guilt-Bubble chapter. The sum of this problem can be described in this simple, highly inaccurate belief that we carry into all our relationships: <span class="CharOverride-9">If something is happening in you, it must be due to me.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re upset or angry, it’s because I’ve done something wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re disappointed or sad, I must have fallen short or done something to let you down.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re hurt, I must have said it wrong or done something wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s all my fault. Your feelings are my fault, I did this to you. And now it’s my responsibility to fix them, and fast.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is a reality that many people buy into. You can have entire relationships where both people are completely hypnotized by this illusion. They have lots of fights that consist of volleying accusations back and forth at each other: “You did this to me, and then you did that to me, and you made me do this, and made me feel this way!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If one person is honest and shares a challenge they’re having in the relationship, the other person exclaims in pain and horror, “How could you say something like that to me?!” This is a defensive maneuver that is designed to shut down any sort of scary or uncomfortable conversations. Nine times out of ten it will work in the short term, especially if the person bringing up the complaint is nice. They will feel bad for bringing up their challenge and stuff it back down, going into apology and damage control mode. Now the conversation is about how mean or bad it was to share that hurtful thing, instead of addressing the underlying issue. Problem solved!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In all seriousness, this pattern doesn’t really work in the long term because the problem is never addressed or resolved and doesn’t just go away by itself. The one who uses guilt to shut the other person down is doing so because they’re scared of painful feelings, criticism, or being left. Of course, by blocking communication they are inadvertently bringing about the very thing they are trying to avoid. Over time they are much more likely to experience more painful feelings, and the other person most likely will leave them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to have thriving, healthy romantic relationships, solid friendships, and effective and enjoyable work relationships, you must find a way out of the trap of over-responsibility. You must be able to distinguish between what is yours and what is somebody else’s.</p>
