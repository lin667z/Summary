<h4 class="Header-02">Hurting Versus Harming</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Yes, but isn’t it bad to hurt people? And when you tell your boyfriend you don’t want to be with him anymore, that’s hurting him. Or if you change the subject when someone’s talking, that’s hurting their feelings. They’ll feel dismissed and ignored. They’ll think you’re not interested (which you’re not) and then they’ll think that they’re not an interesting enough person. They’ll feel bad, and you did it to them. You hurt them, and that’s bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As I write this line of thinking, which you’ve most likely experienced, I am smiling. I can almost see the upset mother or school teacher bending down at the waist, emphasizing the “you’re bad” message with an upright index finger. Can you hear the childhood nice person programming?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Don’t do X because then you’re bad. Anytime you have that thought, it’s a glaring light on your dashboard to slow down and check your engine. There’s something not right going on under the hood (a.k.a. in your brains). When our minds tell us that something is “bad” we immediately stop, as if it were an electric fence. Or an electric chair. It’s not. It’s just the pain and shame that you felt while being criticized or shamed by a parent, or teacher, or some other authority when you were young. It may not be accurate, based on your values, or even real.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The fear of hurting someone is an example of childhood nice programming gone awry. The reality is that life is full of pain. Physical and emotional pain cannot be avoided no matter how hard you try. Hurt is nothing more than a word to describe feeling pain. I stubbed my toe and my foot hurt (physical pain). He called me stupid and I felt hurt (emotional pain).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No matter what you do, people around you are going to feel hurt. And much of the time it has nothing to do with what you did or didn’t do. It’s all about the other person’s ideas, beliefs, rules, and past wounds. If Aunt Linda made a lovely meal for you and you said, “gosh, Aunt Linda, what a lovely meal. Thank you.” Guess what? She could still be hurt. Because while you thanked her for the meal, you didn’t ask for seconds. Instead, she saw you eating some desert later and she thought, “If he was still hungry, why didn’t he eat more of my meal? It must have not been that good, he was just saying that. I’m a terrible cook.” Is that your responsibility? Are you somehow to know that and fix her distorted beliefs? Should you ask for seconds at every meal served to you from now on, just to be safe?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When Jason breaks up with his girlfriend, she will feel great pain, I’m sure. She will feel hurt. But that is not Jason’s job to prevent. He can’t prevent all pain in her, or even in himself. His job is to get clear on what he truly wants, and to communicate this with directness, compassion, and love. In fact, the more direct, the better. If he dilutes his message and implies that he’s unhappy but maybe they can work it out, she now has false hope that drags out the pain even longer.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">People will feel pain, disappointment, and hurt around you. Your beloved spouse and innocent children will feel hurt too. I’m sorry, it is just the way of things on this planet.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This kind of pain, however, is very different than intentional harm. Harm is when someone is feeling pain or anger themselves, and decides to act on an impulse to intentionally cause pain in another. Obvious examples of this are physical violence, verbally attacking someone’s character, or abuse. These are forms of harm and are signals for you to leave the situation. If you are the perpetrator of these acts, they are signals that you need help now to heal whatever is going on inside. More common, everyday examples of harming others include saying that biting and critical comment even though you know it’s not true, but you just want to get back at someone. It’s losing it and yelling at your kid for doing something small that you know isn’t a big deal.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are things that we all might do from time to time, and are indications that we are still growing, healing, and evolving ourselves. They are reminders to continue developing patience, non-reactivity, and our capacity to love more unconditionally.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In short, if you harm someone, do more inner work. If someone around you feels hurt when you clarify what you want and speak your truth, that is a sign for <span class="CharOverride-9">them</span>
 to do their inner work.</p>
