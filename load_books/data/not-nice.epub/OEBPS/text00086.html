<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This topic in itself could be an entire book. In fact, my book <span class="CharOverride-9">The Solution To Social Anxiety,</span>
 my in-depth confidence training course, <span class="CharOverride-9">The Confidence Code,</span>
 and my live event, <span class="CharOverride-9">Supremely Confident Conversation Master</span>
 are all focused on breaking through social fear, maximizing self-esteem, and mastering all the ins and outs of being able to comfortably and confidently talk with anyone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you suffer from social anxiety, or if this area is a major challenge for speaking up, and you really want to master it, I encourage you to explore these other resources. You can find information about all of them on my website: <span class="CharOverride-15">www.SocialConfidenceCenter.com</span>
 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Since this book is all about shedding excessive niceness and people pleasing, that’s what we’ll focus on here. We’ll explore the key shifts you need to make now to start boldly saying more, sharing more, and simply being yourself around others. The earlier chapters in this book have set you up to implement these strategies quickly and easily. By asking yourself what you want, and owning your perspective more, speaking up will now come much more naturally.</p>
