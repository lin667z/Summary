<p class="Chapter-Subheader">INCREASE YOUR DISCOMFORT<br/>
TOLERANCE</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you’re reading this book, you’ve discovered many of the reasons you used to hold back and be nice. You&apos;ve uncovered all the psychology behind this pattern of people pleasing and learned why you do what you do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Despite all the nuance and complexity, we can sum up your need to be nice in just one word: comfort. Being nice, pleasing, and polite is more comfortable than doing otherwise. Sure, it creates pain and suffering in the long run, leading you to feel held back, restricted, anxious, and depressed. But in the short term, it&apos;s a heck of a lot more comfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Speaking up, being direct, having conflict, expressing what you really want, saying no—all of these can be quite uncomfortable. And so, staying nice is a great way to stay comfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But if you want to be more you, then there is only one pathway to get there—discomfort. Yes, I’m afraid it&apos;s true. There’s no way to intellectually solve this entire situation from the safety of your cozy armchair. The only way out is through.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Saying no, taking risks, making mistakes, being messy, and learning and growing is the only way. Of course, understanding your old beliefs, upgrading your map of relationships, and all the other mindset shifts from this book are helpful. They’re liberating. But only if they lead to direct action, which will be uncomfortable, no matter how many affirmations you say today.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I&apos;ve known this to be true for many years. In fact, that&apos;s why I included a warning in my previous book that said “comfort is killing you.” I wanted people to act so they could take control of their lives and their destinies.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But it was only recently that I became fascinated with discomfort. I was thinking about it one day during a long run on a wet spring morning in Portland, Oregon. As I&apos;m known to do, I will often speak out loud to myself while running, just to seem slightly insane to the people I pass. Good old embarrassment inoculation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“If the desire for comfort is what keeps us stuck, then willing to be uncomfortable is what sets us free,” I said to myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So, discomfort equals freedom… It equals results and success. Really?” It seemed strange since so much of what people are pursuing is more comfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But the story checked out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Meeting people and expanding your social life? Requires discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Finding love and then creating a deeply fulfilling, life-magnifying relationship? Big time discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Growing a business, pursuing your dream career, or rising to the highest levels in a company? Mega discomfort.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“If that&apos;s the case, then <span class="CharOverride-10">the more discomfort I can handle, the faster I&apos;ll grow, the more I&apos;ll achieve my dreams, and the better my life will be.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It may sound crazy, but it’s true. The main obstacles that stop you from having the life you want are not external. They’re internal. It’s your fears, doubts, unwillingness to fail, insecurities, and so forth. And all of these are simply painful emotions that we experience in our bodies. So, if we can build our discomfort tolerance muscle, then we can handle all of these inevitable discomforts more easily, and not shy away from them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This still seemed a little strange to me, but I decided to test it out. What if I actively made myself uncomfortable, on purpose, to strengthen my discomfort tolerance muscle? What would the results be? And, how could I give myself some discomfort?</p>
