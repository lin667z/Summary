<h4 class="Header-02">What If I Don’t Know What I Want?</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This is a common question that arises as you begin to look inward and pay attention to what you actually want. At first it can be quite confusing because so much of your life may have been based on what other people want, and what you “should” want in order to be a good son, daughter, employee, friend, spouse, and so on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At first you may be confused and uncertain. Your mind might say: <span class="CharOverride-9">I have no idea. I don’t even know what I want!</span>
 If so, that’s perfectly normal. It’s a natural part of the process. You’ll get better at identifying your desires over time. Until then, don’t be fooled by your mind’s hasty conclusions that you don’t know and will never know what you want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes, when we say, “I don’t know,” we don’t really mean, “I don’t know.” What we really mean is “Ack! This is uncomfortable. I feel uncomfortable and don’t like what’s happening right now. I want it to stop and I want to just go back to how I felt before, even if it was kind of miserable!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I see this all the time in sessions with clients in my coaching and group Mastermind programs. When someone says, “I don’t know” in response to a question, there often is a tone of frustration or irritation. They are conveying either, “I don’t know, and I’m frustrated that I don’t,” or “I don’t know, now back off. I don’t want to know.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We push against discovering what we want because it can be uncomfortable to do so. First, we bump up against our negative beliefs about desire, so we can feel a subtle sense of shame just for paying attention to what we want. <span class="CharOverride-9">That’s so selfish and bad!</span>
 Then there’s fear about what we might discover. What if I don’t want to spend time with that friend anymore? What if I’m secretly feeling disengaged and bored during sex with my partner and I want something to be different? <span class="CharOverride-9">Bad! Selfish! Wrong!</span>
 And then we’re scared about what we’ve discovered because that might lead us to speak up and actually say no to somebody, or bring up an uncomfortable conversation with our partner or anyone else<span class="CharOverride-9">. Eek! That’s freaky. You know what? I just don’t know what I want. I don’t know. I said, I don’t know. Now back off!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yes, it’s scary. And it’s worth it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To help in this process, we want to adopt an attitude of lightness and curiosity. Instead of <span class="CharOverride-9">I don’t know!</span>
 try out Hmmm, I don’t know… Invite in curiosity and wonder. You’re about to learn something, to discover something, to uncover something fascinating and valuable in your life. <span class="CharOverride-9">I wonder what it could be. I wonder what I’ll find out.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And it’s OK if you experience confusion. We are complex creatures and made up of many different parts. Part of you wants to spend time with that friend, and part of you would prefer to be alone. It seems like no matter which one you choose, there will be some sadness or missing out by not having the other option. That’s OK, too. Let yourself miss the other option, even as you pick the first one.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The sense of freedom, ease, power, and confidence we want doesn’t come from picking the “right choice” in all situations. It comes from looking inward, asking ourselves what we want, and honoring what we discover. Even if we don’t choose it, or we don’t get what we want, the simple act of valuing your own desires creates positive feelings of power and freedom.</p>
