<h3 class="Header-01">The Selfish<a id="_idTextAnchor052"></a>
 Algorithm<br/>
(a.k.a. “Good Person”<br/>
Algorithm)</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">So far you’ve learned two breakthrough ideas about selfishness. First, it’s in the eye of the beholder–whether something is deemed “selfish” varies based on who’s deciding. Second, after years of excessive niceness, your sensors may be a little off. You might not be the best judge of what is selfish, and tend to conclude that any act of self-interest is too much and “bad.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Enter the Selfish Algorithm. (Insert theme music here.)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is a formula I created after my bloody, err, messy Thanksgiving experience. It is a series of questions you can ask yourself to determine if something is self-denying, in your healthy self-interest, or indeed too much to ask for. Think of it as a re-calibration process to go through until you return to your natural sense of healthy self-interest.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Simply ask yourself the series of questions below to determine if something is too selfish or not. First, we’ll just go through the questions, then I’ll give you some examples so you can see exactly how it works. Then you can try it using a situation in your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">1. What Do I Want?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Pretty standard, you are quite familiar with this question by now. Yet it is the place we must always start from. What exactly do you want? If you were operating from complete self-interest, what would it be? Do not water it down or compromise yet. Start with what you truly want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">2. How much do I want this?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">On a scale of 1-10, rate how strongly you want this. How important is it to you? How strong is the desire? 1 being minimal and 10 being strong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">3. What needs of mine am I trying to meet?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Remember the six human needs? Certainty, variety, significance, love/connection, growth, and contribution. Which of these needs are you trying to meet? If you notice that trying to please others or avoiding conflict is driving you (a.k.a. certainty/safety, trying to preserve connection), make a note of that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">4. How will this impact the other person?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Determine what the other person might feel and experience as a result of your actions. Then on a scale of 1-10, rate how strong the impact will be, 1 being minimal impact, 10 being high impact with burden or cost associated to it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">5. How can other people meet their needs and get support?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Get creative and think of other ways that the people you’re impacting can get the help or support they need. How else could they meet their needs if you don’t do it for them?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">6. Are there any other ways to meet my needs?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Similarly, get creative about how else you might meet your needs. Are there other ways to do it beyond what you came up with in question 1?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Let’s take the Thanksgiving example to illustrate how to use the Selfish Algorithm.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">1. What Do I Want?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I want to spend time with cousins, my brother, and other extended family. I don’t want the effort of flying with and managing kids, and I want some adult time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">2. How much do I want this?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">I really want this, and the need feels strong, so I give it an 8 out of 10.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">3. What needs of mine am I trying to meet?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Variety - time away from kids, playing games with cousins and Tariq (my brother).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">Love/Connection - spend quality time with Tariq, connection with extended family.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">4. What will be the impact on the other person?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">Candace feels lonely and left out. She also experiences several days of solo parenting and increased demand. Impact is 8 out of 10.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here are a few tips on answering questions 1-4. First, don’t water down number 2. If you have a habit of discounting your own desires and only letting them be strong if you are certain everyone would support you, pay attention. Notice how much you want this, and how important it is to you. Set aside judgment or what you “should” want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Similarly, when it comes to question 4, pay close attention. Old patterns of niceness may make you imagine negative impacts where none exist. You might create a fantasy of how someone will react, without actually finding out the true impact. In addition, it’s easy to exaggerate the size of the impact, imagining your friend will be utterly crushed if you decide to not attend their dinner party, for example.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In short, slow down and be aware as you do this exercise. The purpose is to examine years of conditioned thinking and see clearly what is really happening.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Also, note that if your desire is higher and the impact on others is lower, then in most cases it would be optimal for you to take action to go after what you want. This is healthy self-interest. Habitually denying this will lead to passivity and resentment while frequently acting on your desire will bring energy, power, freedom, and a more loving and generous disposition. Let’s continue on now to look at questions 5-6.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">5. How can other people meet their needs and get support?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I travel for work, I ask myself this question about Candace and our boys. There are often other ways she can get some help with parenting, ranging from my parents being in town to a nanny, so she can have a few breaks, take a shower, and otherwise be an autonomous human. In the Thanksgiving situation, because it was a holiday weekend, no help was available and friends were all busy.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">6. Are there any other ways to meet my needs?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my major draws to fly down to L.A. was to spend time with my brother. Another possible way to meet the need for connection would be to schedule an extended phone call with him. I was also craving some sort of variety. Other ways I could meet this need overall in my life would be to challenge myself, grow, get crazy with my kids, and take risks in life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, what’s the verdict? To go or not to go? After running it through the Selfish Algorithm, my decision would be to not go. Or to change my plans and fly down as a family. This is primarily because my desire to go and the impact on Candace were the same level of intensity. That, in addition to the fact that she didn’t have support while I was gone, and I could meet one of my core needs of connection with my brother in a different way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now it’s your turn. What is a situation where you struggle to make a decision? Perhaps a situation where you judge yourself as selfish and don’t even examine what you want, let alone ask for it. Practice going through the Selfish Algorithm now to see what insights you have about your current situation, and how you decide things for yourself in general. Over time you will start to ask yourself these questions without having to sit down and formally go through this process. Your ability to discover your own healthy self-interest and act on it while supporting and respecting others will grow, as will your trust in yourself that what you are doing is truly beneficial for all.</p>
