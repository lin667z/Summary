<h4 class="Header-02">You Talk Too Much</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Yesterday morning I was at the gym, working out with a good friend of mine who’s also my personal trainer. He’s managing several clients while I’m there, so we get a few short conversations in when he comes to check on me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This particular morning, I was lit up. I was feeling energized and excited about life. My body felt good, I had recently broken through yet another “injury” in my shoulder (which turned out just to be suppressed emotion). This last breakthrough further strengthened my confidence in my body, and in my ability to work out, get strong, and have the energy I wanted without pain or fear of pain. It was awesome.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was also reading some fascinating books, learning and growing a ton, and just feeling on my game. As usual, we chatted a few times, he shared something he learned from a podcast, and I shared some recent insights I’d had. What was different about this morning is I talked more. I shared a couple extra stories. In one moment, when we both were about to say something at the same time, I kept going to share what I wanted.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In that very moment, I had the thought: <span class="CharOverride-9">he didn’t like that I kept talking. He wants to talk more and wants me to listen. I’m talking too much.</span>
 This is not a new thought, it’s something that I’ve experienced for a long time. When I was younger, I would sometimes leave a friend’s house, having had an amazing night of talking, laughing, drinking, and feeling really connected. But then when I got home that night, or the next morning, that thought about talking too much would creep back into my mind. I’d start to feel self-conscious and bad about myself. I would sometimes convince myself that my friends didn’t really like me, because they were annoyed by how much I talked that night.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The crazy thing is I didn’t even talk that much all the time. Just on days where I felt particularly jazzed up or excited. And yet, the programming to speak less, be quiet, and be nice is strong in me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On this particular instance with Josh, I noticed the thought and simply dismissed it. No, I thought, <span class="CharOverride-9">it’s OK for me to be excited and talk more sometimes. He seemed very engaged, so he may have liked it. And if he didn’t, that’s OK. We have lots of time together and sometimes he may be a little annoyed.</span>
 How’s that for boundaries, huh? Victory!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">With this claiming of my value and refusing to turn on myself, I let it go and didn’t give it any more thought that day. Then I got a text from Josh later that afternoon.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Love seeing you all the time my man, and I love seeing you step up and play big. Proud of you, and stoked for all the things you are bringing forth!”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I read it, I laughed out loud. The message was heartfelt and loving, which felt great. But what made me laugh was seeing how absolutely <span class="CharOverride-9">dead wrong</span>
 that critic in our minds can be. The day I am the most energized, passionate, and talkative is the day my friend says he loves being around me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This one is so powerful it’s worth slowing down to really take in. Is it possible that when your mind tells you that you talk too much, that you’re not interesting enough, that others don’t like this or that about you, that it’s completely, 100% the opposite? Is it possible that the more you freely let yourself out, with your energy, enthusiasm, passion for whatever lights you up, that others love being around you and want more?</p>
