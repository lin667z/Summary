<h4 class="Header-02">5 Relationship Truths</h4>
<h5 class="Header-03">1. People Aren’t Fragile</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Your old map might tell you that if you speak up, say what you want, or share directly, you’ll hurt others, perhaps deeply. But when you slow down and examine your fear of how you’ll hurt others, you’ll discover how it holds you as all-powerful and the other person as extremely fragile. They just can’t handle it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you see certain people in your life that way? Do you imagine your honesty would crush them?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The truth is people are not fragile. They are strong, powerful, and resilient. Most of us can endure so much more than we realize, so much more than we’ve ever had to. Humans survive extremely intense experiences and brutal conditions, like slavery and prison camps. Humans are fierce in their determination and will to survive, thrive, and liberate themselves.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, can Terry handle you telling her that she needs to get that email to you once per day or you’re going to have to let her go? Yes. Can your husband handle it if you start a discussion with him about who does what chores in the evening after the kids go to bed? Yes. Can your girlfriend handle it if you tell her that you want to end your relationship? Yes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Others may not like these things. Heck, <span class="CharOverride-9">you</span>
 might not like these things. You don’t want to have the conversation either. But you know the cost of not speaking up, so you’re willing to do it anyway. And you know that <span class="CharOverride-10">people are not porcelain dolls that will shatter if you speak the truth.</span>
 People are strong and can handle life. And when you treat them that way, you’re treating them with the respect and dignity they deserve.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">2. Upset Is Temporary</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One major roadblock that prevents people from being more assertive or direct is the fear of upsetting others. This is reasonable enough, because directly addressing a conflict is more likely to result in upset than avoiding it and stuffing it inside (at least in the short term). But it’s important to remember that upset is temporary.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you bring up a challenging topic, ask a difficult question, or share something directly, the other person is going to have feelings. That’s OK. That’s normal. That’s good! We want to stop seeing feelings as bad, scary things that shouldn’t occur. A healthy range of emotional responses includes anger, upset, sadness, and many other feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Keep in mind, however, that the person you’re speaking with is only upset now, in this moment. Time passes and feelings shift. Nothing is permanent, especially in the ethereal realm of human emotion. You can also remind yourself that the upset is in service of creating a richer relationship, deeper connection, a better professional environment, etc.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes when my wife is upset about something and we have a discussion about it, I’ll imagine she’s still upset hours later. I’m studying her as she moves about the house, reading deep into her nonverbal signs, interpreting body language and voice tone, and continuing to conclude that she’s angry. When I get out of my head and simply ask her, I am surprised to hear her response, “Upset about that? That was hours ago. I’ve let go already.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The upset was temporary, but I was perceiving it as permanent. I was keeping it alive and making it real in my own mind, which impacted my feelings and nervous system. How often are you imagining others are upset with you? Is it once in a while, or do you do it all the time? Is it one of your favorite pastimes?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It can be helpful to take a moment to slow down and really see the truth about people and relationships. Upset really is temporary. This can create relief and spaciousness to be yourself and share more freely. Even if someone is temporarily upset by what you say or do, it’s not permanent.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If someone does get upset and then withdraws and turns it into a permanent grudge or hatred of you... look out. That is not someone you want in your life. They have a strong need to feel certain and significant by making others bad and wrong, and are unlikely to meet their needs in more healthy, positive, growth-oriented ways. They’re probably not the optimal person to be in any sort of relationship with.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">3. Truth Is Not Bad</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">If, in the past, you’ve lived a life of over-responsibility for the feelings of others, then you’ve done everything you could to avoid hurting them. This most likely included withholding the truth. In fact, you may have concluded that being honest is bad, it hurts others, and it’s better to keep that inside and be nice. I mean, “if you don’t have anything nice to say, don’t say anything at all,” right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is another aspect of our relationship map that we need to update. Truth is not bad. It’s good. Honesty is what connects us with others and creates deep, healthy, lasting relationships in our personal and professional lives. If there is a consistent pattern of withholding what’s actually true, people begin to drift apart. They may stay in the situation because they feel obligated to, or because leaving the relationship seems too scary and difficult, or they’ve worked that job for twenty years and don’t know what else they’d do. But they won’t feel connected, engaged, and fully alive. They won’t thrive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The truth brings energy and vitality back into our relationships. It breaks us out of certainty and predictability and brings us into the realm of uncertainty, where all energy and passion comes from. When we’re being fully honest, we no longer know exactly what’s going to happen next. We can feel nervous, excited, or terrified. Yes, some of these feelings can be uncomfortable, but they also tell us we’re alive!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We’re no longer trying to control the other person by withholding information so they’ll stay near us. We’re no longer playing life like a game of chess where you must calculate seven moves out to avoid all pain. Instead, we’re jumping in, being real, and fully living. It’s edgy and it’s invigorating. <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m not sure what I’m going to say next, and I have no idea how they will respond because I haven’t shared this before...</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you make a habit of doing this, all of your relationships will improve. People crave real connection and authentic communication. Most of them are just too scared to initiate it themselves. And yes, there is a way to be skillfully honest and tactfully express ourselves when it comes to difficult subjects. We’ll cover more about how to do that later in this chapter. But the how comes second. First, we must fully realize that the truth is not something to be avoided. That is simply old, fearful, inaccurate thinking based on painful moments we’ve had in the past, or messages we learned growing up. It’s time to start sharing the truth–with yourself and with others. Because the truth will set you...</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">4. Others Aren’t Victims</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">When you <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 get this one, and it just becomes part of how you see others, your communication power and social freedom skyrocket. It’s similar to the truth that people aren’t fragile, but it goes further. This mindset says, not only are people strong, they are the owner and creator of their lives. They are the captain of their ship and the master of their destiny. So am I, and so are you. Everyone is, whether they recognize this or not. And many people, unfortunately, do not recognize this and actually fight to maintain the viewpoint that they are not the owner in their life. They are, in fact, a victim of circumstance. Their feelings, actions, and results, are all determined by forces outside of themselves and outside of their control. Their challenges, pain, and struggles are everyone else’s fault.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We discussed this earlier in the book: the importance of not seeing others as victims of circumstance, even if they see themselves that way. The key now is to upgrade your map so you stop subconsciously assuming everyone’s a victim who can’t handle things, blames others for everything, and doesn’t take responsibility for their life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can <span class="CharOverride-9">decide right now</span>
 that you are going to give everyone the gift of seeing them as a powerful creator in their lives. They have an infinite, untapped power and potential to grow, break through challenges, and create the life they want. They may or may not choose to do that, and it’s not your job to make that happen for them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you see others in this light, the background fear, over-responsibility, and excessive care-taking urges dissolve. This allows you to create healthy, lasting relationships that bring great value to your life and the lives of others.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">5. Speaking Up in Itself Is Good</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Just like the truth is good and serves relationships, so does speaking up, in and of itself. Regardless of whether the other person receives you well, agrees with you, or gives you what you were hoping for, speaking up is good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you speak up about something, you can get a sense of closure. If you don’t, your mind has an unresolved, unexpressed energy that drives you nuts. It can create pent up feelings, resentment, and endless rumination about the situation. But speaking up in the moment, or soon afterwards, can dissipate all of that, even if you don’t reach a perfect resolution and solve everything immediately.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Speaking up is about self-expression, and the more you express yourself, the less bothered you’ll be afterwards.</span>
 I didn’t understand this truth for years. My old relationship map guided me to keep quiet, hold back, and not say anything that could be seen as angry or defensive. So, I was pleasing in the moment, but I’d leave a hot mess of pent up anger, resentment, frustration, hurt, and confusion. I’d ruminate about conversations for days, feeling more and more wound up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then I realized that if I’m really bothered after an interaction, and it lasts for more than a few minutes, that’s a sign of suppression. It means I held myself back, played nice, and didn’t speak my mind. It’s a signal to speak up more and, most likely, be <span class="CharOverride-9">less</span>
 nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you internalize this belief, you will find way more freedom to speak up. Instead of mentally grinding away for hours on how to say something, or the “best way” to say it so you do it right and get the result you want, you simply share more in the moment. You are able to put your perspective out there, disagree with others, and offer your opinions. Because you know that if they get upset, it’s temporary. They’re not fragile, and they’re not a victim. Speaking the truth as you see it is healthy for the relationship and brings energy and vitality, and speaking up in itself is good, regardless of the outcome.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you can do this, you are free. Free to speak up for yourself, free to share who you are, and free to just be you. And that freedom feels amazing. Let’s turn our attention now to specifically how to do this in the most skillful, effective way.</p>
