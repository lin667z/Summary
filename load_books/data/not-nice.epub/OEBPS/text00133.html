<h4 class="Header-02">5 Tips for Saying No Like a No-Master</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In my glory days, I played my fair share of <span class="CharOverride-9">Warcraft</span>
 computer games. If you’re not familiar with them, they involve maneuvering orcs, wizards, night elves and other fantasy creatures around a cartoonish world so that they can build armies and slay each other. It’s one part strategy, one part creativity, and one part frantic clicking.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I loved these games and I played all the solo missions and thoroughly beat the computer. I was the best. And then I decided to try my hand at online combat, playing against some anonymous dude (or dudette) somewhere on the other side of the country or the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I logged into the online combat mode, and awaited my opponent in the arena. Several seconds later, I had been matched! Warcraw43. I like it. Sounded like a nice chap.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The game took several seconds to load and then we began. I chose the human race, because the humans were the best, and that’s all I’d played against the computer. I saw my familiar five worker peasants and my home base. I sent one to chop wood, two to mine gold, and two to build a barracks–gotta get those foot soldiers ASAP; this is a war after all.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As my guys were working, I typed in, “hey there!” into the chat window. After a brief delay I saw the following on my screen.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Warcraw43: gl hf.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I had no idea what that meant (I later discovered it stood for “good luck, have fun”). But he didn’t seem too talkative, so I focused on my army base. Things were going well. By now I had four foot soldiers and was working on my next building. Soon I would have my blacksmith so I could build knights. Then, I’d be unstoppable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Seconds later, I see a gang of nine orcs running into my base. He had orc grunts and headhunters. He had better units and twice as many units. How had he built them so fast? How was that even possible?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I hastily clicked my troops, making a feeble attempt at defending my base. Within seconds it was all over. He smashed through my troops without losing a single one of his units, and then demolished my base.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As his small army was burning my buildings to the ground, this appeared on my screen.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Warcraw43: You suck, noob.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ouch. The online battle world was a brutal place.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This was my first introduction to the term noob. You may be familiar with it, or it still may be relegated to the nerdiest corners of the internet gaming world. But essentially a noob is a beginner.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Despite what my angry friend Warcraw43 has to say about it, being a beginner is completely fine. It’s the only way to begin anything new. Below you will find 5 key tips to help you say no less like a noob and more like a practiced master.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">1. No Is a Complete Sentence</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The urge to explain, justify, and give lots of reasons is sure sign of a No-Noob. Trust me, I know the feeling. It feels bad, we don’t want to hurt their feelings, and we want to make sure they feel loved and OK about themselves. So, we give a dozen reasons as to why we’re saying no, so they know it’s not about them (even if it secretly is).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The first tip to being more of a master is to avoid over-explaining. Short is good. You can convey kindness in other ways, as you’ll see below. But explaining too much makes you come across as anxious and unsure, as if you’re doing something wrong. Instead, simply say no thank you. Or, if you want to offer a reason, keep it brief.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No-Noob: I’m sorry, I can’t make it. I would love to normally, but I have to pick up my dog that afternoon and I have a report due the following day. I wouldn’t be able to get everything done in time. It’s been a crazy week. Sorry : )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No-Master: Thanks for the invite. Unfortunately, I can’t make it this time, but let me know about the next time. That sounds like fun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">2. No Apologies</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Did you notice in the last example how much apologizing was going on? This is another sign of our discomfort with no. We’ll discuss unnecessary apologies in an upcoming chapter, but for now, watch out for apologizing as you say no to someone. Again, it makes it sound like you’ve done something wrong. But you haven’t.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Yelling at someone you love, or saying something cutting or mean out of hurt or anger, that’s worth an apology. Texting while driving and hitting a biker—that’s worth an apology. Saying no to an invitation or an offer? I don’t see anything wrong with that. You are simply stating your preference.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I’m sorry, I like yellow socks.” Would you apologize for that?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice how in the example above, the No-Noob apologizes twice in one simple message. The No-Master does no such thing. She does say “unfortunately,” which conveys that she is disappointed to not join in because it sounds like fun. But this does not convey that she is at fault for saying no.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">3. Make It About You</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sometimes, further information or an explanation is needed. For example, if a friend invites you to do something, and you know that you don’t want to do that activity, it can be helpful to let them know. Otherwise, they will keep asking you to do it, and you will keep saying no, which can create a sense of rejection. But the truth is you like that person, you just don’t like the activity they are suggesting.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my clients had a group of several girlfriends who loved to spend an entire weekend together. They would go up to some house in the hills and hang out all day, go out in the evening, and sleep over at the house. They would wake up, make breakfast, and hang out again the next day, lounging on the deck and soaking up some sun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That sounds delightful to me, assuming I really liked that group of friends, but my client didn’t like it. She was more introverted and really needed alone time in between being with people. She had gone once and found the experience both fun and exhausting.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Since then, her friend would invite her each time the group was getting together. My client had avoided going several times by providing excuses as to why she couldn’t make it. Her friend had asked her yet again about an upcoming weekend when we spoke about it in our session.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We began by exploring what she really wanted. Did she want to go at all? What if she could go for part of the time? Or if she could go and then also step out from group activities for several hours each day? These were completely new options for her, because in the past she would have immediately dismissed them as inappropriate and offensive things to ask for.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">She decided on going for just one day. She’d join the group Saturday morning, then drive home Saturday night to sleep in her own bed. She liked the chance to spend time with friends, and the idea of having all day Sunday by herself. It was a win-win. There was only one problem. How on earth could she say that to her friends without offending them?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of my mentors in graduate school, Matt May, told me this phrase which I’ll never forget: “You can say anything, if you say it in the right way.” I use that as a reminder when I want to say no, or ask for what I want, and I feel like it’s “wrong” or “inappropriate.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In this instance, the choice to attend less about her, instead of about them, is a much more skillful way to communicate her desire. Instead of saying, “I don’t want to spend the entire weekend with you guys, it drives me nuts,” she might opt for something focused more on herself that is more vulnerable and real. She could say “Thanks for the invite! I love spending time with you and the others. I noticed the last time I went that I really need more alone time on the weekends to recharge. So, here’s what I’d like to do. I’d like to come up there Saturday morning, spend the day with you all, and then drive back Saturday evening, instead of spending the night.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice how this is about her, and her preferences and needs. Also, notice how she doesn’t check at the end, “Is that OK with you?” She could do that, and there’s nothing wrong with doing so. I just question why she would need to. She’s not doing something wrong. She’s not asking to borrow someone’s car. She’s simply stating her desired plan for the weekend.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After we came up with this way of phrasing her “no” to the whole weekend hangout, she had a concern, which you might share with her.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“But, how will my friend respond? Won’t she be upset and feel rejected? Won’t she try to convince me?” she asked, sounding alarmed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Maybe,” I said. “We could play that out and see how you might handle it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“OK,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“OK, you say what you’re going to say, and I’ll be hurt and offended and try to convince you to spend the entire weekend,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hi, Jessica…” she began, hesitating a little, “I’m looking forward to seeing you this coming weekend. Thanks for inviting me. I wanted to tell you ahead of time that I plan on just coming for Saturday. I love spending time with you all, but I find that I get filled up socially quickly. I really need my alone time to recharge on the weekend, so I can do that on Sunday. How does that sound?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What?” I replied, with a little mock drama. “You don’t want to hang out with us both days? Didn’t you have fun last time?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I did. I really enjoyed our conversations about dating out on the deck. I just feel like I need a little less time with everybody is all.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“OK…” I inserted a long pause, just to intensify the guilt and discomfort—this is exposure after all. “Well, if that’s what you want to do. I’ll let everyone know you don’t want to stay the whole weekend.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We concluded the role play and I checked in with my client. “How was that?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So painful!” she said. “So awkward. I don’t know if I could do that.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What makes it so painful? What do you feel as you practice saying no to what you don’t want and stating what you’d prefer?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I feel so guilty. She’s hurt and disappointed. I can’t stand doing that to her,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Doing that to her,” I said. “That’s strong language. As if you are actively hurting her…” I paused for a moment, thinking of what to say next. I knew the way out was to take less responsibility for others, for my client to finally give herself permission to honor her own desires, and to trust that she could still have love, connection, and friendships, even when she said no. The way out was through.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Let’s slow down for a minute. Breathe and feel your body. Where do you feel that guilt and discomfort?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“In my chest,” she said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Good, let’s slow down even more. Bring all of your attention right to that place in your chest, and just breathe. No need to make it go away or run from it. Just meet it with curiosity, patience, and love.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We sat in silence for several minutes, both paying attention. I could feel her energy shifting from fear and flight to being more centered, clearer.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What if it were safe for you to say what you wanted?” I asked. “What if others temporarily felt disappointed, but loved you anyways?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">She sat in silence for a few moments pondering these questions. I knew the answer that she spoke wouldn’t matter as much because the question had already gotten in. Her mind was already processing the possibility that it is OK to speak up for herself and say no.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And the same is true for you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">4. Warmth &amp; Appreciation</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This approach helps you stay connected with the other person as you say no. Many people, just like my client above, feel uncomfortable saying no. We imagine all kinds of negative feelings and reactions from the other people involved. And so, to combat this, we marshal our inner warrior and gear up for a fight. This makes our no come out more harshly than needed, which often brings about the reactions we are most afraid of. In the words of the wise Taoist master Oogway, “One often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, you can convey warmth and appreciation as you say no. This starts with fully realizing that you are not doing anything wrong and that you have complete permission to say no. It also requires that you let go of over-responsibility for the feelings of others. Yes, they might feel sad or disappointed, and that’s OK. You can witness that and even support them, just as you might if their upset had come from something else in their life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Warmth is communicated in your voice tone, facial expressions, and body language. Appreciation is communicated verbally by thanking them for the offer.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here’s an example from just last night. We were having dinner with my parents, who were visiting from Las Vegas. My wife, children, and I are planning on flying out to Las Vegas for four days in the spring to visit my folks and have some fun in the sun. It will be the first time we’ve flown our kids out there. As we ate dinner, my dad began.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“How long are you planning on visiting?” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Four days,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That’s it?” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yeah,” I said. My voice tone was upbeat and friendly. Note the lack of apology or explanation here. I had done nothing wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well, you guys could come for longer,” he said. “You had mentioned wanting to rent an RV for a week in the summer. You could start your RV trip out in Vegas and make a road trip home.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Thanks for the invite, Dad, I appreciate how much you love having us out there. I think we’ll pass on the RV idea, but I’m really looking forward to bringing the boys out there. I think they’ll love your pool.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Warmth was conveyed in my voice and sharing the aspects of the trip I’m looking forward to. I also directly thanked him and said that I appreciated his offer. This is a simple yet masterful way to stay connected with someone when you’re saying no. This allows you to still be kind, without having to say yes to something that you don’t really want to do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Side Note: Beware using the word “but” when appreciating someone. But is a contradicting phrase that tends to negate whatever you said before it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example let’s say you ask a friend how a recent baseball game was, and they replied “Watching the game was fun, but it was way too hot.” It was fun, BUT it was too hot. The heat tends to overshadow the fun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In terms of saying no, notice how you respond to this: “Thanks for offering, I really enjoy spending time with you, but I’m busy that weekend.” It’s subtle, but people often hear the first part of that sentence as just a platitude or you being nice. They don’t buy that you really feel that way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One simple solution is to avoid using the word but in those situations. You can either use the word “and” or just make it two statements.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Thanks for offering, I really enjoy spending time with you, and unfortunately I’m busy that weekend.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Thanks for offering, I really enjoy spending time with you. I’m busy that weekend, so I won’t be able to join.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Both of these allow your warmth and appreciation to be received more fully, and make it less likely that they will be seen as something you are just saying to make the other person feel better.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">5. Say No Early</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do it. Rip off the Band-Aid and just say it now. Because in so many instances, you already know that you want to say no. You know you don’t want to attend that event, or that you don’t feel like going out with that friend that evening. But instead of saying no right away, because that might seem offensive or dismissive, and it’s your job to take care of everyone’s feelings after all, you say, “Hmm, maybe. Let me check my calendar and get back to you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now you have this future no hanging over you. It becomes a bigger deal, and something uncomfortable you want to avoid. In addition, it leaves the other people involved hanging with a loose end, unsure where you stand. It’s not good for you or them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, say no early. Say no instantly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Hey, do you want to go see that new Captain America movie?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Ehh, I’m not a big fan of the comic book movies. Let’s do something else.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“The three of us are getting together after the conference to get a bite to eat. I’d love to catch up with you. Want to join us?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Oh, thanks. Catching up sounds really good, and I’d love to do that. This evening won’t work though, I’m planning on running and then having some down time. Want to do breakfast on Sunday?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">(If you don’t want to catch up with this person, just leave off that last question. Do not offer this out of politeness!)</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Rather than offending others, saying no early is actually refreshing and very appealing. People know that you will say what you want and don&apos;t want, and they will trust you more as a result.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">---</p>
