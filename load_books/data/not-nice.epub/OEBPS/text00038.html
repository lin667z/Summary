<h4 class="Header-02">2. Resentment &amp; Rage</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Anxiety is already unpleasant, especially if it’s frequent and strong. But in the fight-flight-freeze response that is built into our nervous system, flight (which is anxiety) is only one of them. We also have a fight response somewhere down in there because we humans are strong, proud, spirited animals. We’re not easily broken. Even when oppressed for a long time, we have a way of eventually fighting back and breaking free. This is true inside of you as well.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While you may only be aware of the fear, inferiority, desire to please, pressure to perform, and other anxiety, that doesn’t mean that’s all that’s happening inside of you. There is also an inner response of anger occurring as well. This one took me quite some time to see and believe in myself, because I was a flexible, relaxed, nice guy who loved everybody, right? Let me use an example to highlight the process.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s say Jim has a boss who is the worst. He demands long hours out of all his employees, berates them if they don’t get everything done just the way he wants, and threatens to demote or fire people if they displease him.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Jim really needs this job; it pays well and he has two small children at home and a mortgage on a new house. How do you imagine Jim feels in this situation? That’s right, stressed. He feels his time is scarce, as if there’s more to do than he has time for. He feels nervous before meetings, and worried that he might be the one to receive his boss’ wrath that day. He adopts a pleasing attitude towards his boss and other seniors, hoping to get on their good side as he keeps his head down and does the best job he can.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What else is Jim feeling? Pissed. He’s angry because there is a part of him that does not like to be treated that way. That part hates all the demands and the stress. That part certainly does not like the berating and threats from his boss. That part is mad as hell and wants to tell his boss to shove it (and maybe much more). Now Jim might be aware of this, or he may not. It really depends on how fused he is with his nice-guy mask. If he’s aware of it, he may talk himself down and say, “I know, it’s terrible. But hey, we gotta pay the bills. Just stick with it for one more year, then you can move to a different company that’s better.” This allows him to push the anger down just a little, so he doesn’t spew it out in his next business meeting. This is called suppression, and it’s something we do all the time.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If Jim is not that aware of his anger, he may just feel stressed. He may be irritable with his wife and kids because it’s safer to be angry at home than with his boss at work. This is called displacement. A lot of his anger might be repressed, which means it’s pushed down and hidden. His nice guy persona is so effective; it heads all this anger stuff off at the pass, long before it reaches his conscious mind. Because Jim is a nice guy. He doesn’t want to hit his boss in the face with a baseball bat. How outrageous and absurd. (Although I bet if I made a joke about hitting his boss with a baseball bat that Jim would laugh and love it.)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you read about Jim, what are you seeing about the ways you build up anger and resentment in your own life? This example is extreme, but resentment is a subtler form of anger that is happening all the time in all of us. Moreover, the nicer you are, the more resentment you have. Because we hate to be mistreated. We get secretly angry and enraged when someone threatens us or berates us, like Jim’s boss. And when we’re walking around the world as ultra-nice people, we are treating everyone around us as if they’re Jim’s boss.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Think about that for a moment because it will blow your mind. If you’re anxious about pleasing others, and you’re worried about what others think, and you’re afraid they will reject you for your looks, for the way you talk, for how smart you are, for being not good enough… what are you imagining others are like? Harsh, judgmental, critical, quick to reject, intolerant, and dismissive. This makes you super anxious because their opinion means a lot, often more than yours does. That means not only are they jerks, they also have a ton of power over you. Just like Jim’s boss. And when that happens, inside you get angry. Part of you fights back.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This same part is resentful about needing to be so kind and caring all the time. It resents taking care of others, listening to them so much, putting them first. All the self-sacrifice and prioritizing others makes this part resentful, then angry, then pissed, then enraged. Most of this is happening beneath the surface, beneath our awareness. Because being resentful and enraged are certainly not things that a nice person would do. We will help you untangle this mess and start to feel your anger in Chapter 8 of this book. You can then start to use it consciously to generate a tremendous amount of power, which will help you step up, speak up, feel better, and be a more genuine, happy, healthy human.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But before we do, we have to look at a few more of these specters. Because this next one is the answer to the question, “What happens to all that anger if I’m not aware of it? Does it just go away?” I’m afraid not…</p>
