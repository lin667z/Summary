<h4 class="Header-02">The Benefits</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you become aware of your shadow, stop rejecting it, and welcome it in without judgment, some amazing things will happen. You will start to feel lighter, more energized, and freer. That oppressive sense of badness, shame, and guilt will begin to lift, and you just might start liking and loving yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This shift occurs because you’ve started to really pay attention, in a curious and non-judgmental way, to a part of yourself that desperately needs your attention. Instead of being at odds with yourself, running from and suppressing parts of you, you’re becoming self-aware.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In addition, you start to become OK with who you are, and less concerned with what others will think. The things we’re most afraid others will judge us for—pettiness, anger, jealousy, insensitivity, greed, sexual desires, and all the rest—we accept. We won’t have to vehemently deny or defend the reality that part of us is sometimes selfish, or angry, or greedy. It stops being such a big deal. We become more at peace with all aspects of ourselves. And you will begin to see just how powerful you really are.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As this raw power grows, you will become ready to use it to boldly and unapologetically speak up for yourself. Socially, in your relationship, and at work, you will start to say what you think, ask for what you want, and speak your truth. You will say what needs to be said, even if it’s uncomfortable. And as you do this, your entire world will transform.</p>
