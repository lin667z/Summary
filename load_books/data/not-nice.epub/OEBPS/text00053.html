 ER 7:</h2>
<p class="Chapter-Subheader">HAVE<br/>
BOUNDARIES</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you will see in the chapters to come, boldness training is all about speaking up for yourself, saying “no” when you want to or need to, and prioritizing yourself instead of always putting others first. These, and many other behaviors, will transform your sense of power and freedom. However, if you don’t understand boundaries or, worse, don’t have any, then all of these liberating behaviors are just a fantasy. They’re science fiction. Things you wish you could do, but seem far off, impossible, and maybe even “not allowed.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now I know the topic of boundaries might sound a little boring. <span class="CharOverride-9">Why are we starting here? Shouldn’t we dive into the “say what I want and tell others to shut it” part of the book?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here’s the thing: If you don’t have boundaries, you won’t know when to tell others to shut it. You won’t know what you actually want, because all you’re aware of is other people and what they want. Without boundaries, there is no you to speak up for!</p>
