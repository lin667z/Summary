 lize Guilt</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you make your new rules and start to live by them, you might experience mixed feelings. On the one hand, it can feel empowering and liberating to start living life on your own terms. You may even notice exciting new results, differences in how people respond to you, and newfound powers of attractiveness in your love life and effectiveness at work. And at the same time, you may notice more guilt arising.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s a normal part of the boldness training process, and not a sign that you’re actually doing anything wrong. This is a key distinction. Most people have a knee-jerk reaction to guilt that causes them to feel bad because the unconscious logic goes like this: <span class="CharOverride-9">If I feel guilty, then I must have done something wrong.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The way out of guilt is to slow down and examine it. When you notice you’re feeling guilty, identify it out loud. “Ahh, this is guilt.” Then pay close attention. Slow down, bring your awareness to your mind and your body. Because the feelings of guilt can be painful, your impulse might be to stay in motion, distract yourself, or compulsively apologize. Instead of reacting to guilt, examine it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do you say to yourself when you’re feeling guilty? What does that internal, chastising part of you say about you? This is the “voice of guilt” and it’s very important to notice how it’s speaking to you. Is it calm and loving? Is it angry and critical? Is it like a raging parent who’s lost it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do you feel in your body? Do you feel tightness in your chest or a squeezing in your belly? Do you feel scared, uneasy, or heavy inside? Become intimately familiar with the patterns of guilt inside of you. Study how you “do guilt.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, ask yourself the most valuable question you can ask yourself whenever you feel guilty: <span class="CharOverride-9">What rule did I break?</span>
 This is the first step in neutralizing guilt because it will give you valuable information about what’s happening and how to deal with it. You need to determine if this is healthy guilt or unhealthy guilt, if this is something pointing you towards being your best self, or just another sneaky pattern of perfectionism and self-hatred.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To determine what rule you broke, simply listen to the voice of guilt in your head. It’s going to tell you clearly what you should do, or should not do. What you should have done, or shouldn’t have done. Those shoulds are the rules.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here are some examples:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">You shouldn’t have eaten that hamburger, fries, and a milkshake. And so much of it! What’s wrong with you? You’re going to lose everything you’ve been working towards. You’re going to get fat. That was terrible. You should have more self-control.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">The Rules:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should not eat fast food.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should not eat to the point of being overly full.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should have more self-control.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">You should’ve said “yes” to John’s invitation. He really wanted you to come, but you didn’t. That was very selfish of you. You could’ve just gone for an hour. That wouldn’t have been a big deal. He’s going to be so disappointed. And maybe he won’t want to hang out with you later because you hurt him so much.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">The Rules:</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I shouldn’t say no to a friend’s invitation.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I shouldn’t do anything that disappoints others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Are you getting a sense of how this works? Try it out in a scenario in your life that used to make you feel guilty in the past. Notice what the voice of guilt says to you, and then practice identifying the underlying rules. Once you are able to do this, you are well on your way to neutralizing guilt and feeling happier, freer, and loving with yourself and others.</p>
