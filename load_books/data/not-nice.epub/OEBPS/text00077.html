<h4 class="Header-02">How to Harness the Power</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">
<span class="CharOverride-9">“You don’t know the power of the dark side.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">- Darth Vader</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Don’t worry, we’re not going to turn you into Darth Vader, or the twisted evil Emperor Palpatine from the original <span class="CharOverride-9">Star Wars</span>
 movies. There’s a common misconception that acknowledging our shadow, or giving attention to it, will make it grow stronger. This is a fundamental premise in several dominant religious schools of thought. If you listen to the devil, it will seduce you into making bad or evil choices. Or, in the modern day positive thought or law of attraction movements, people say, “Don’t focus on the negative stuff. That will just bring more negativity into your life, man.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">While there is truth in these philosophies, and we can use them to better ourselves and our life circumstances, they are also missing a fundamental quality of human nature. <span class="CharOverride-10">That which we repress doesn’t grow weaker, it grows stronger.</span>
 If you had a dog that barked loudly or sometimes growled at people and you decided to solve the problem by putting the dog down into the basement and locking him in there for days or weeks, would that make him calmer and tamer? Probably not.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once something is pushed out of awareness it “goes rogue” and just starts operating beneath our conscious attention. The further down it gets pushed and the longer it’s repressed, the more intense, and sometimes twisted it becomes. This is where you get the unfortunately well-known example of the pious priest who only represents goodness and purity, but turns out to be molesting children. He has so disconnected from his sexuality, has pushed it so far down into the shadow, that it starts to become twisted and grows in power until it can take over.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A less intense example that we can all relate to is that of how we eat. Let’s say you have a certain food that you don’t want to eat because you know it’s not the best for your health, but man it sure tastes good to you. Pizza, chips, french fries, soda, candy, those croissants from that French bakery down the street, whatever. One day you missed your lunch and the drumbeat pulling you towards those fries got so loud and persistent that you couldn’t resist. The urge overtook you and you pull up to the drive through window to order your guilty pleasure.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice that phrase. Guilty pleasure. Guess what keeps that whole pattern going? The guilty part. Because even as you order the fries, part of you (your Superego) begins its moralizing rant. It might not be strong enough to get you to change your course of action. <span class="CharOverride-9">I mean, I’ve already ordered them…</span>
 But it sure might take away some of your pleasure. And then afterwards it begins in earnest. <span class="CharOverride-9">What’s wrong with you? You have no willpower. You are fat and disgusting. You are going to gain weight and get fat again. If people knew how weak you were they’d think you’re pathetic.</span>
 And on and on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is your Superego trying to teach you a lesson to make sure you don’t let your Id take over again. It’s using the “punish and lecture” approach that we all learned growing up, which never really worked though, did it? It attempts to smash the shadow by berating it and you for listening to it. It attempts to deny those impulses and push them deep down into the basement.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then guess what you’re doing five days later after you miss your lunch again? French fry city.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We need a better way. We need to align with ourselves and tap into the power of our shadow. Because our shadow is nothing more than raw, instinctual, primal impulses and desires. These include sex, hunger, desire, anger, and passion. When we are connected to these, we are connected to the primal source of life, the engine that drives everything else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How do we tap into and harness this power? We do this by taking the time to actually listen to that part of ourselves. To give it our full attention and meet it with curiosity. Here are my two favorite ways, that I alluded to earlier in this chapter.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Shadow Journal</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Find a private and secure place where you can feel safe to write out anything and everything that comes to your mind. This is not the kind of journal you are going to flip back through, awakening enchanting memories of past meals and experiences. This is more like vomiting onto a page.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The sense of privacy and security is important, because if some part of your mind knows that someone, sometime, somewhere could read what you are writing, you will most likely inhibit yourself. This hinders the journal’s effectiveness. You want to feel completely free to write out anything, without any concern that it will ever be read or judged.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You can do this by keeping the journal as a locked file in your computer that requires a password to open. Or you could type it out in a document, and then simply select all the text and erase it when you are done. If you prefer pen to paper, you can just be sure to keep your journal in a drawer, or somewhere it is unlikely someone will find it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you have that figured out, it’s time to start writing. I suggest fifteen to twenty minutes per session. If you get into it and want to continue, that’s great. In those twenty minutes, your goal is simply to write freely, quickly, and uninhibitedly from the shadow parts of your mind and heart.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At first, much of this is unconscious. We are not even aware that we’re angry, or resentful, or sad, or sexually frustrated. Just reading this chapter may have opened up more of your awareness, and writing in a Shadow Journal will continue that process. The key is to start with what you are aware of.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The easiest way to get writing is to begin by discussing your feelings from the day. What happened that was exciting or challenging? How do you feel about the events that occurred, and the people you interacted with? As you let this flow, you can begin to ask yourself questions about your current circumstances in general:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">• What is upsetting to you in your life?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">• What pressures do you feel?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">• What demands do others place on you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">• What demands do you place on yourself?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">• What irritates or frustrates you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Starting with these kinds of questions can help you access your repressed feelings.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It also helps to remember that your shadow is mostly made up of your Id–the impulse-driven, immature, irrational, pleasure-seeking child inside of you. This part wants pleasure, wants it now, and hates not getting his or her way. He wants to be taken care of, and have all discomforts and problems taken away. She wants to be admired, praised, and seen as special. He may have fantasies of revenge, glory, or sexual conquest. She may be judgmental, petty, and highly critical of others. When you sit down to write, think about your life from this part’s perspective. What might your Id be pissed off about?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This kind of journaling can be an uncomfortable and humbling process. You start to see just how immature and irrational a part of you can be. This awareness, and the discomfort that it brings up, is the main reason most people will never look inward in this way, and never do a journal like this. And, unfortunately, most people remain stuck, frustrated, dissatisfied, people-pleasing, anxious, unhappy, and never reach their dreams and true potential. Let’s not be like most people in that way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you get into it, you just might find that this journal becomes relieving, helpful, and liberating. I personally have found that writing in this way greatly reduces stress, improves my mood, makes me more relaxed, loving, generous, and playful. All the energy that had gone into suppressing my shadow is now liberated and I have more vitality.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is one of my go-to self-care routines whenever I am feeling stressed, overwhelmed, frustrated, or impatient. I am sure to do this daily when I notice myself feeling physically sick, or if physical pain or an old injury “acts up” out of nowhere. No, I didn’t sleep on my neck wrong. I’m pissed off and I need to express it and release it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I suggest you simply begin experimenting with it to get a feel for your style. Type or write quickly and do not overthink what you are writing. Let it be full of typos and misspellings. Do not go back to fix them or review what you have written. Remember, this is simply about expressing these parts of yourself, not making sure it’s legible or looks pretty.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, the uglier you can make this, the more effective it will be. Let it be a safe container for you to feel and express anything. Anything. Cursing, raging, nasty comments, hateful words and sentiments, all the things you want to say but never would dare to out loud. Here is the place.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Rage Walk</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Get suited up, it’s time to go for a walk. No headphones, no audiobooks, no cell phone, no distractions. Simply set out for 20 minutes, or more, and be with yourself. This activity is similar to the Shadow Journal without the writing. You can ask yourself the same kind of prompting questions and focus on the frustrations of your Id.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you walk and focus on these things, let yourself fully feel the agitation and frustration inside of you. Let yourself feel raw anger and rage. Ideally you are taking this walk down empty suburban streets or around a park–somewhere there aren’t too many people around. Then, talk out loud. Speak some of your frustrations, angers, and resentments. If there are people nearby, you can always say these things under your breath.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I do this, I walk quickly, let myself feel, and mutter quite a bit. I also let my face express the feelings I am having; I’ll grit my teeth, furrow my brow, and flare my nose. I let myself curse, and rage at all those people and situations in my life that enrage me. Sure, I may look insane, but who cares? I’m not doing this walking down 5th Avenue in New York City. This is a side street in suburban Portland, very few people are around, no one notices, and no one cares.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It also helps to breathe deeply as you feel the anger and other emotions. Deep, full breaths in and out. Fill your belly and chest with air. I also like to take the fingers of my dominant hand and gently tap on my chest. This, combined with the breathing, helps to move large amounts of anger and other emotions quickly.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Much like the journaling, after doing one of these walks I feel clearer, lighter, and refreshed. I am more resourceful in addressing my challenges and problems, and in dealing with people that may be frustrating or taxing.</p>
