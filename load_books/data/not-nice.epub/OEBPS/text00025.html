 hy Guilt Versus<br/>
Destructive Guilt</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Your mom or dad, or whoever told you to not hurt others’ feelings had good intentions. They wanted you to be kind, compassionate, aware of others, and a good person. This is healthy. If someone is able to harm others without feeling discomfort, guilt, or remorse, that’s part of the diagnostic criteria for being a sociopath.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, there is such a thing as healthy guilt. Guilt is a feeling of regret or remorse for doing something that you would rather have not done. This happens to all of us. We are tired, or hungry or self-absorbed and we say or do something that we don’t really mean.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Just two days ago, my second son Arman woke up around 5a.m., as he is known to do. He is a little guy, just ten months old. He is bright-eyed, quick to smile, and absolutely adorable. I love him so much it hurts. As he woke up, I took him out of the bedroom so my wife and other son could keep sleeping.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unfortunately, in this moment, I had a strong need to pee. Experience has taught me that setting little Mani down in the bathroom is not ideal because he makes a hasty crawl-dash towards the toilet, where he attempts to dip his little pudgy hands into the mysterious contents within.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The alternative solution, which is holding him in one arm while peeing, has also become problematic. He’s a gigantic and strong baby, and often attempts to launch himself out of my arms.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Therefore, I decide to set him down in the living room, right next to the bathroom, leaving the door open so he could see and hear me. As I walked into the bathroom to experience sweet relief, I heard his piercing cry. Not the kind of cry that’s a slow <span class="CharOverride-14">build</span>
 , so I could quickly take care of business and then get him. No, this was the banshee wail that would wake up the house. Grrr. I walked back to the living room, feeling angry. I just wanted to pee for God’s sake! As I reached down to pick him up, my teeth were gritted tight and I wrapped my hands around his body with more force than was needed. I hastily lifted him up, my body language screaming, “Ughhh, what do you want now?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As soon as I had him in my arms, I noticed big tears streaming down his face and for some reason his left eye was puffy. When he felt my angry energy, he cried even harder. This instantly snapped me out of my self-absorbed state and I saw this sweet little guy in front of me. His small sad face and puffy left eye broke my heart. I felt so bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I hugged him tight, right against my heart as he calmed down. “I’m sorry buddy,” I said as I swayed back and forth. “I love you. I’m sorry I picked you up like that.” I felt his little heart against mine and he instantly calmed down and rested his body against mine as we shared a magic moment in the early morning light. I still had to pee, but that didn’t matter anymore.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Even as I write this, my heart hurts a little and I cry. This is healthy guilt. This is the warning light that goes off when I’m out of alignment with my values, with who I want to be as a father. This guilt wakes me up and guides me back on track. This is very different from destructive guilt.</p>
