<h4 class="Header-02">Your Approval Seeker</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Let’s explore how your Approval Seeker shows up in your life. What things do you do to make sure people like you? What things do you avoid, so others won’t be upset?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a moment to reflect on this now. The more self-aware you can become, the more power you have to transform yourself and your results. Be sure to think about each of the core areas in your life–your work and career, dating and romantic life, friends and family.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">15 Common Signs of Approval Seeking</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">1. Avoiding No</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You avoid saying no to others. You fear they will become upset or think you’re a bad person, so you usually say yes, even if it adds more stress to your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">2. Hesitation</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You often wait for the “right thing” to say (and thus speak way less than you normally do).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">3. Nervous Laughter</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You’re quick to laugh at whatever another person says, even if it’s not that funny. Your laugh might come too quickly, too often, or at inappropriate times.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">4. Difficulty with Endings</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You have difficulty ending things, from conversations to friendships to romantic relationships. As a result, you may drag things out longer than you really want to.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">5. Overly Agreeable</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You smile, nod, and are very agreeable with others (regardless of your actual opinions on the subject).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">6. Avoiding Disagreement</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You avoid disagreeing with others, challenging others, or stating alternative perspectives.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">7. Fear of Judgment</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You’re afraid of the judgments of others (which can lead to nervousness, hesitation, over-thinking, and social anxiety).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">8. Fear of Upset</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You’re often afraid that others are secretly angry or critical of you, even though they seem to like you when you’re together. This can lead to a constant background unease that you may have “done something wrong” that someone is upset about.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">9. Pressure to Entertain</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You feel pressure to have something great to share, such as a funny or highly engaging story about an adventure you’ve had.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">10. Second Guessing &amp; Conversational Replays</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">During an interaction, you experience self-consciousness and doubt about how you are coming across. You imagine you should be someone “better” than you are. Afterwards, you replay the interaction in your mind and find all the things you did wrong, ways you may have upset the other person, and things you should have said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">11. Habitual Apologies</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You’re quick to apologize out of habit, even for minor transgressions, like starting to speak at the same time as someone else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">12. Submissive Body Language</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You demonstrate submissive body language, such as looking away frequently or keeping your eyes down.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">13. Putting Others First</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You have a strong habit of putting others’ needs ahead of your own, thinking it is selfish to do otherwise.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">14. Not Stating Desires</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You rarely state what you want directly. Instead, you may suggest or imply something and hope the other person detects it. You often question your desires and think they might be either too much or not worth asking for.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">
<span class="CharOverride-10">15. Attempting to Fit In &amp; Impress</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">You try to fit in to groups by pretending to be interested in things you are not, or exaggerating about your experiences, wealth, or achievements. All submission to peer pressure is approval seeking.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">The Cost of Approval Seeking</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">How many of the fifteen signs on that list do you notice in yourself? Over the years, I’ve seen this pattern with clients: The more you try to avoid disapproval and earn approval, the more you suffer. This is because each of these behaviors is pulling you away from yourself, and draining you of social power.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Small things like submissive body language, habitual apologies, and nervous laughter can have a big effect on your life. They can reduce your romantic options, make people want to talk with you less, and even determine the difference between being hired or being passed over during a job interview.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Bigger patterns like being overly agreeable, feeling anxious about entertaining others, and avoiding conflict, can all create limited, tense experiences. You become limited to a box of your own making.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you combine that with a deep fear of upsetting others and a belief that they’re making harsh judgments that condemn your character and worth, then you’re in big trouble.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And trouble is the right word for it. With a strong need for approval, it can feel like you’re walking through life like a student who is wandering the halls without a hall-pass. At any time, someone might jump out and chastise you for doing something wrong, and they’d be justified. This creates a chronic unease and fear that makes it very hard to relax, let go, enjoy your relationships, feel love, and be in the moment. It undermines your self-esteem because you value others’ opinions more than your own; it sucks the joy out of life.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Approval Seeker Activate!</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">For some people, the Approval Seeker is driving the bus in almost all of their interactions. When I was struggling with social anxiety, I felt the need for approval whenever I spoke with strangers, in the classroom, with colleagues at work, women I was interested in, men who seemed confident... the list went on and on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The only time I was not seeking approval, was when I was with my family or close friends. In those situations, I perceived I already had their approval, so I could relax and be myself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How frequently does your Approval Seeker show up? For most people, this pattern is not fully conscious. They aren’t walking into a meeting thinking: <span class="CharOverride-9">I sure hope everyone in there approves of me. I will make sure I hesitate, only say witty and intelligent things, and agree with everything so I avoid their disapproval.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, you just might feel anxious before the meeting. You are hoping it “goes well” and you get whatever outcome it is you want: to be hired, to get the sale, to have your ideas heard and accepted, and so on. You might feel nervous about speaking up, or compare yourself to someone else during the meeting, and feel inferior. Afterwards you might replay certain moments, criticizing yourself for missing opportunities to speak up and say things better than you did.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">All of that is based on approval seeking. You wanted people in that meeting to like you, and to accept you and your ideas. That’s what creates the nervousness, the comparisons, and the attachment to being seen in a certain way.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So how frequently does your Approval Seeker show up? It might not be in every interaction, like it was for me. It may only be in certain situations at work, when you have to deal with people you find intimidating or powerful. It might show up in your dating life when you meet someone you think is beautiful or handsome. It might show up in your romantic relationship as concerns over your body and appearance, as wondering if your partner still finds you attractive.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Pay attention over the next few weeks to when your Approval Seeker activates. You want to become better and better at spotting it as it’s happening. This gives you great power to become conscious of the old patterns that used to run you, and to choose something different for yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For example, just last month I noticed my Approval Seeker coming on strong when I had an opportunity to interact with someone whom I admire who is highly successful in my field. He is a highly respected and famous author and teacher. Leading up to the interview I was nervous, and during our conversation I was more enthusiastic and agreeable than I normally would be. Afterwards, I started to second-guess myself and replay our conversation, searching for verbal missteps. While it was uncomfortable, I was excited to identify this behavior because now I knew what I needed to work on in order to grow my confidence. I decided that one of my primary social goals was not to be intimidated by anyone, no matter how successful.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The goal here is not to completely eliminate this desire for approval from your life. That’s an extreme demand, and probably impossible to do. Instead, notice where the urge for approval is strongest. And, as best as you can, do so with curiosity, compassion, and love.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You’re not on a witch-hunt here. You’re not looking to find that wretched monster and slay it. In fact, <span class="CharOverride-10">this part of you that so desperately wants others’ love and approval needs your love and approval more than anything else.</span>
 In the second and third parts of this book, you’ll learn how to heal this longing and release the never-ending quest for approval. But first, you need to become aware. If this habit of approval seeking is unconscious and you aren’t aware of when you’re doing it, then it will be difficult to break free.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">The Approval Seeker Versus The Powerful You</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">In this chapter, we’re exploring the part of you that wants approval from others. But there is another part of you that is already whole, complete, secure, and capable. This is The Powerful You. Throughout the course of this book, you’re going to activate and strengthen this part more and more, until eventually being powerful is just how you show up in the world, wherever you go.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To distinguish between the two, here is a list of some of the differences between these two parts of you:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker wants to be liked by everyone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You doesn’t need to control anyone’s perception. You focus on showing up as 100% yourself, knowing that you only need to find your people, not everyone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker sees others as better and their opinions as mattering more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You knows that you matter. Your thoughts, feelings, and opinions are worth sharing, simply because they come from you. You know that looks, wealth, or any other external marker does not increase someone’s inherent worth as a human.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker needs something from others in every interaction.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You does not <span class="CharOverride-9">need</span>
 anyone to do anything. You focus on being curious, sharing, connecting, and enjoying yourself. You are the source of approval.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker cannot tolerate being disliked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You gives complete permission for others to think whatever they’d like, and loves that diversity of human experience. You know that the only criticisms that bother you are the ones you agree with.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker worries constantly if it was “good enough.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You gives whatever you have at this very moment. You contribute your gifts fully, with an unfettered boldness and fierce determination. Your best is good enough. And, of course, you’ll always be growing and getting better.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker imagines others are quick to make harsh and permanent judgments.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You knows the world is a friendly place. If someone is harsh, they are disconnected from their heart, deeply hurting, and in need of compassion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker thinks self-approval means very little.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You knows that how you feel about yourself determines how much love, success, and happiness you let in. You have a deep, unwavering commitment to be on your own side, no matter what.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker tries to get people’s respect and admiration.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You serves people powerfully and expresses your heart fully, earning deep respect and admiration as a byproduct of your bold action.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker avoids ruffling feathers and tries to keep everything smooth.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You speaks honestly and directly. You know that friction is inevitable in all healthy relationships and is a sign of two whole people coming together.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker hates standing out and conforms to the status quo.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You stands up for what you believe in and is a force for good who is willing to fight for positive change in your community and the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Approval Seeker says, “Oh no! What will they think?” and stops.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-6">• The Powerful You says, “Ehh, whatever,” and moves on.</p>
