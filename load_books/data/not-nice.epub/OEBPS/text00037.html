<h4 class="Header-02">1. Anxiety</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As you’ve seen from the last few chapters, trying hard to be a nice person means attempting to please others, feeling bad for not living up to your rules or for hurting others’ feelings, and avoiding anger and conflict. This creates anxiety. You are worried that others will not like you, about being a “bad person” and losing relationships because of it, and about getting upset or other people being upset. Life is full of fear.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Is this your experience? How much time do you spend worrying? Worrying about others’ feelings, your performance, and whether so-and-so thinks you’re such-and-such: good or bad, smart or stupid, hot or not. How about the fear of saying the wrong thing, losing face, or making a fool of yourself?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For many years, I had a terrible habit of replaying conversations in my head. Usually the ones I’d replay were the most awkward, strange, or embarrassing. Although sometimes I’d pick a seemingly ordinary one and replay that as well. As I replayed them, repeatedly, my mind would pick apart all the things I did wrong. All the ways I spoke too much (or too little), said the wrong thing, didn’t do it quite right, or otherwise sucked. This is a kind of rumination, which is just another form of anxiety.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And don’t get me started on the anxiety about other people’s feelings. I experienced so much stress over making sure everyone felt OK. If I suggested the movie or the restaurant, I had a hard time enjoying myself because I was responsible for everyone’s experience. If I invited several people to do something and they didn’t know each other, I had to make sure everyone liked each other and had a great time. If I said or did anything that could offend, bother, hurt, or annoy someone, my anxiety would skyrocket (and guilt would soon follow). Can you relate?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I can go on and on, but I think you get my point. Anxiety takes a toll on your mind and body. It keeps you in a fight, flight, or freeze state with your nervous system all wound up, shooting cortisol, adrenaline, and norepinephrine through your system. It can mess with your sleep, digestion, libido, sexual functioning, and your mood, to name just a few. It’s not pretty, and I’m afraid it gets worse…</p>
