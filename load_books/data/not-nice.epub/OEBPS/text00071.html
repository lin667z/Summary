 Not Just<br/>
a “Nice Person”</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I’m sorry to break it to you. You’re not just a nice person. You’re not <span class="CharOverride-9">only</span>
 kind, loving, generous, good-hearted, patient, wise, smart, proactive, and responsible. I’m not saying you aren’t these things. In fact, you may have many or even all of those qualities. But guess what? You’re also selfish, self-centered, judgmental, impatient, impulsive, greedy, and careless.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Ouch.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now before you throw this book across the room in defensive disgust, hang on for one moment so I can explain. I am all these things, too. We all are. Because we humans are animals, even though we often forget this fact, and we are extremely complex. In fact, we share a large amount of our core brain structures with reptiles. This part of our brain is primarily concerned with keeping ourselves alive, securing a mate and having sex, and maintaining power and domination over others so that we can secure said mate and sex.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We also have a highly advanced emotional brain that we share with all mammal species. This makes us focused on deeply connecting with others, helping them out as they help us out, and devoting ourselves to taking care of our young children. And then we have some super advanced stuff going on in our neo-cortex that no one fully understands yet. This sucker evaluates scenarios and acts with higher order reasoning, ethics, and other abstract concepts. It allows us to time travel to the future and envision things that do not yet exist so that we can create them. And it taps us into something so miraculous that we experience self-awareness and consciousness.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This combination is incredible and makes us a most miraculous species. And at the same time, it can be quite confusing, especially if you think you are just supposed to think or feel only one particular way, that your mind is just one singular entity rather than a collection of parts that can vary greatly in their desires and intent. Once you realize this, and start to accept and own your shadow, you become more clear, and more relaxed with all parts of yourself. This reduces guilt, fear and anxiety, and greatly increases your power in all areas of life.</p>
