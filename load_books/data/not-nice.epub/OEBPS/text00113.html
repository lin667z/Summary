<span class="CharOverride-9">“If a man does not become what he understands,<br/>
he does not understand it.”</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-7">- Kierkegaard</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This is how the typical process works with clients that are becoming less self-denying and healthier in their self-interest. First, they’re completely trapped in the nice-person cage, only vaguely aware of the pain it’s causing them. They have the occasional thought of, <span class="CharOverride-9">I’m too nice</span>
 , or <span class="CharOverride-9">I shouldn’t be so nice all the time</span>
 , but it passes and they remain in the same patterns.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, as we work together and they see how much pain nice is causing, and how rooted it is in fear, guilt, and people-pleasing, they begin to transform their beliefs. They start to acknowledge that it’s OK to not be nice all the time, and sometimes you have to put yourself first. So far, so good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But then they almost always hit this snag. They intellectually get that it’s good to act in their self-interest, and that being overly nice isn’t working. They “understand” that it’s good to ask for what you want and be direct. But…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I still <span class="CharOverride-9">feel like</span>
 it’s bad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I still <span class="CharOverride-9">feel like</span>
 I’m hurting people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I still <span class="CharOverride-9">feel like</span>
 it’s selfish and wrong.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I still <span class="CharOverride-9">feel like</span>
 people will be upset with me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m mentioning this now because there’s a good chance that might be happening for you now. First off, whatever follows the phrase “feel like” is never a feeling.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel like you’re hurting me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel like you don’t care about me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel like it’s time to do something about it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel like a sandwich.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">All of those are ideas or beliefs. Except for the sandwich, that is a thing you can eat. The others are statements of thought. I think you are hurting me. I believe you don’t care about me. I think it’s time to do something about it. The feelings underneath these statements don’t have the word like in them. They are:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel hurt.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel rejected and unwanted.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel frustrated and determined.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I feel hungry.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Do you see the difference? So, when you understand it intellectually, but you still feel like it’s bad, guess what? That means you still believe it’s bad. It means the nice-person programming is still holding on there, telling you that it’s not OK to ask for what you want or put yourself first.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There are two ways to deal with this. The first would be to re-read this chapter from the beginning. Slow down and really let yourself see how painful and damaging the nice patterns can be. If you really understood how much it was hurting you, then you would reach a pain threshold that would help push you to the other side. If needed, you can also go back and re-read Chapter 5 from Part I – “The High Cost of Nice.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Secondly, take a few minutes to write out all your objections. All your “Yeah, buts…” Are you thinking of certain situations where you just couldn’t possibly put yourself first? Are you thinking about how your partner, or colleagues, or friends, would get upset with you if you acted in your self-interest more? Is your mind cataloging evidence about why it wouldn’t work if you spoke up?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Write all these objections down and see if you can answer each one. Perhaps you’ll see that many of them are just fear. They’re just your Safety Police holding on even tighter. <span class="CharOverride-9">If you do that, terrible things will happen! Terrible things, I say! Whatever you do, do NOT open that door! You hear me?!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In other instances, perhaps you’re seeing yourself as helpless or powerless. <span class="CharOverride-9">He won’t let me do it. She gets too emotional if I speak up, so I “have to” keep quiet. It’s her fault.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is where you must do the inner work. You must be more interested in seeing the truth than defending your old way of being. The truth of what creates happiness, health, and loving relationships. The truth of what actually works in life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you have done this, the key is to claim what you want. Fully and completely, beginning with complete self-interest.</p>
