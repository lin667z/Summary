<h4 class="Header-02">Dude, Your Reality Is Weak</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I pulled up in front of her house in my aging silver Chrysler Concord. It was a sweet ride. And by sweet, I mean dangerously unreliable. The A/C worked intermittently, there was an electrical problem with the blinkers, and each time you started up the car there was an insanely loud buzz that came out of the glove box area and lasted for eight seconds. Oh, and sometimes if you slowed down to under five miles per hour the engine would die and the steering wheel would lock (hence the dangerously unreliable part). Still, it was the car I learned to drive in and it had been passed down from my dad to my mom to my older brother, and now, to me. No one had died in it yet, so the odds were in my favor.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I checked my reflection in the mirror, making sure I looked as good as I could. It was my first date with Alexis. I was going to meet her at her house, hang out for a bit, then go into downtown Santa Barbara for dinner and a movie. I was nervous. She was talented, funny, intelligent, and gorgeous. Obviously, in my mind, she was better than me, out of my league. I didn’t want to mess it up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Ok, here I go</span>
 , I thought to myself. I took a few breaths in and out, then opened my car door. I walked towards her front door, feeling both excited and nervous energy moving through my body. I rang her doorbell and took a step back, waiting on the porch.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">She opened the door wearing a snug-fitting maroon sweater and skin-tight jeans. Wow, she was beautiful. And better than me. We greeted and she invited me in. She offered me a drink and I said sure.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What kind?” she asked. She listed several different beers.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Whatever you’re having is fine,” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">From that moment on I was in her reality. Everything was being filtered through the “will she like this?” filter. Will she like my beer choice? Will she dislike it if I said I didn’t want a beer at all? (Which is what I actually would have preferred.)</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On the drive to the movie I chose music that I thought she would like. I felt self-conscious about the songs playing, wondering if they were good enough. The dinner, the movie, the topics of conversation… everything was filtered, modified, edited for optimal pleasing. I was so gracious, so polite, so... nice.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After that date, I never saw her again. Well, perhaps in passing somewhere around the UC Santa Barbara campus. But never on a date. Because after that she didn’t want to go out with me again.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What happened? Where had I gone wrong? I was so confused, hurt, and frustrated by the entire experience. And it was one that seemed to happen again and again. I blamed my appearance, my height, my face, my eyes, my clothes, my car, and my athletic abilities. Although I didn’t realize it at the time, it had nothing to do with any of these. It was simply because I didn’t live in my own reality.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What does that mean, to “live in your own reality?” No, it doesn’t mean being disconnected in some strange psychotic hallucination. <span class="CharOverride-10">To live in your reality means you own who you are, what you like, what you believe in, what you stand for, and what you think and feel in the moment.</span>
 It means you are aware of these things and are living your life according to them. It means they matter to you more than the perceptions, likes, dislikes, and beliefs of those around you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">There is a strength and a solidity to owning your reality. You are there. You are present, and your presence can be felt. The problem with my date with Alexis was that she couldn’t feel me or my presence. I was a clear plastic bag that was wrapping around her, morphing to her shape and characteristics. I wasn’t a real, solid, full other human that she was having contact with. And that’s just not that appealing–in love, business, or any relationship.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The first step to releasing yourself from the grips of the Approval-Seeker is to start to own your reality. You have already been doing this by discovering what you want and valuing your perspective. To strengthen your own reality even more, let’s do this little exercise.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Grab a journal or open a note file on your phone or computer so you can write a few things down. For each question, write for 2 minutes straight, without pausing, over-thinking, or analyzing what you are writing. This is just for you to reflect on, not something you are going to turn in to be graded.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What do you love?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">(<span class="CharOverride-9">What do you like, appreciate, and enjoy?</span>
 )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">What do you hate?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">(<span class="CharOverride-9">What do you dislike, what annoys you, bothers you, irritates you, or pisses you off?</span>
 )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">What do you believe?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">(<span class="CharOverride-9">What do you believe in? Start each sentence with “I believe...”</span>
 )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">What is great about you?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">(<span class="CharOverride-9">What are your strengths, positive qualities, quirks, and endearing traits? What makes you, you?</span>
 )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">What’s your purpose?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">(<span class="CharOverride-9">Why are you here? What is the point? What are you going to do?</span>
 )</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As I often do, I’ll play along with you. Perhaps my sharing will highlight something for you, inspire you to be more expressive or free, or just help you feel like you’re not such a nut once you see what kinds of crazy stuff I write. In any case, here’s what comes to me as I answer the above questions:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">What do you love?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Myself, my kids, Candace, sunshine, rain, green grass and big trees, the forest, the sky, the Sierras, mountains, comfy sweatpants, Nike Free shoes, Apple gadgets, writing, breaking through fear, getting up super early and getting stuff done, my family, my friends, this life, my health, my body, learning, outer space, The Mystery, apples and almond butter, good sci-fi books and movies, audiobooks, growing and learning, kale.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">What do you hate?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Unconsciousness, disconnected greed, people who injure others and don’t care about it, people who knowingly harm humans, animals, and the earth but somehow delude themselves into thinking it doesn’t matter so they can attain even more money (that they’ll never spend anyway), most country music, angry and ignorant racist pundits, cultural hypnosis, that TV has so much hypnotic power over most people who have access to it, when people don’t look inwards and grow, haters, people who tear others down because they will never take the risks themselves, violence, rape, humans who are disconnected from their hearts.</p>

<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I believe everyone is beautiful and has an inner light that is more attractive than any external appearance.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-8">I believe each person is 100 times more powerful then they see, realize, or believe.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">What’s great about you?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am smart, funny, witty, and highly intelligent. I learn things quickly and can grasp concepts and ideas rapidly when I put my mind to something. I am extremely dedicated, committed, and disciplined. I am courageous, bold, and willing to face my fears again and again. I am a fantastic speaker and I can quickly connect with individuals and entire audiences by being present, authentic, vulnerable, and energetic. I am great looking, attentive, endlessly curious, and fascinated in life. I ask great questions and fully listen to people as they share. I tell engaging stories and I can make almost anyone laugh. I am an amazing dad–present, loving, expressive, patient, and willing to look inward and continually grow. I am an amazing husband–loving, devoted, curious, emotionally expressive, vulnerable, inspiring, and fun.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">What is your purpose?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am here to eradicate social anxiety and instill confidence. To smash through fear, doubt, hatred, and criticism. To bring power, boldness, authenticity, humor and love for myself, and for as many people as I can on the planet. I am here to take care of my family, to create an extraordinary love with Candace, and to give my children all I can to support them in becoming powerful leaders in their own lives. I am here to be a Warrior of the Light. To positively impact as many people as I can during my life, and afterwards through what I can create. I am a force for good, a force for God.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you have not done this exercise, I highly encourage you to stop now and do it. Strengthening your reality and sense of self has a powerful effect on your inner confidence and self-esteem. It also directly impacts those around you, as they see you as more self-assured, powerful, and as a leader.</p>
