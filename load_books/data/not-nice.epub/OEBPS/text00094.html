<h4 class="Header-02">Your Perspective Matters</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">We talked about owning your perspective earlier in this book. This is especially important in your work and business life. If you have any of these stories rattling around in the back of your head, it’s time to let them go:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I don’t know enough yet.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m not as smart as others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Everyone is more skilled and better than I am.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am a fraud.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am an impostor.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I should know more than I do.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If I say I can do something, I’ll fail.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It’s best to avoid more responsibility and play small.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These stories are toxic sludge. They aren’t true and they don’t serve you or anyone in your company or life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">They come from this strange phenomenon: you comparing the inside of you to the outside of someone else. Let me explain. You’re aware of your inside–how you feel and what you think. If you’re nervous or insecure, you feel it in your chest, your throat, or your stomach. Your breathing is tight and your mind is full of worried thoughts. Outwardly, you probably don’t say all of those crazy thoughts and you try to keep it cool. That’s your outside, your persona, your mask. We all have it and we all do it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The problem is we don’t see the inside of other people. At best, we get their report of what’s happening inside. If someone is open and vulnerable with us, they may tell us what’s going on inside, but in most work settings, people are not that vulnerable. They put on their suit, get their game-face on, and show up looking put together, no matter what they think or feel.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Hence, the strange comparison. Outwardly, Jimbo looks strong, bold, confident. He speaks with authority and certainty. He seems to know what he’s talking about. Internally I feel unsure, doubtful, and have conflicting thoughts. I must not be as smart as Jimbo, or know as much. I must be a fraud, an impostor!</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But guess what’s happening inside Jimbo? The same kind of stuff! Uncertainty, doubt, confusion, fear. He feels them all. He just has a very practiced and polished exterior. Now, we don’t know to what degree he’s feeling all those things in any given moment, but I guarantee you that as a human, he feels all those things and more.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once we understand this, and see the truth of it, we can begin to relax. We see ourselves as human, just like everyone else. We are no longer less-than, weak, flawed, or broken. Our thoughts and feelings are OK. We’re OK. And from that place of relaxed, deep self-acceptance, tremendous power emerges. The power to speak up, to share, to express yourself and your ideas freely.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You, as you are right now, have something to contribute. It’s time to start owning that and stop dismissing it. It’s time to stop disrespecting and diminishing yourself based on some weird, erroneous comparison to another’s persona and image. What would happen if starting today, right now, you decided that your perspective mattered? It didn’t require years of experience or some higher level of intelligence. It didn’t even require you to be the smoothest or best communicator. What if your perspective mattered right now, just as you are?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My guess is you’d start to share it more, wouldn’t you? What do you notice as you imagine that? For many people who’ve held back for too long, fear is waiting for them at the doorway to freedom. “Don’t step through,” it whispers. “You will surely die out there.” It paints a vivid picture of embarrassment, failure, public humiliation, and shame. It does everything it can to keep you from taking those risks, to keep you small, and safe.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But you can just walk right through that door, you know. That voice is just like a recording on the loudspeaker at an airport. “If you notice any unattended baggage, please report to a TSA security agent immediately.” You can pay attention to that voice, or not. It’s just there, part of your experience, as you get your snacks, walk towards your gate, and prepare to board the plane.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now is the time to start sharing. It can be scary at first, but guess what? It won’t be less scary six months from now… Or six years from now. It will only stay the same, or get harder. But if you decide now to start taking immediate action, it will get easier, and your power will grow.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Remember, start small, with questions as we discussed above. Then start inserting your ideas, perspectives, and opinions. Again, small at first–with one colleague, in low pressure situations. And slowly work your way up the ladder of risk until you can say what you think to your boss, to his or her boss, and to anyone, no matter how successful, rich, or powerful.</p>
