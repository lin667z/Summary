<p class="Chapter-Subheader">100% YOU</p>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">As we&apos;ve gone on this journey together, you’ve seen how being nice and pleasing is not who you are. You&apos;ve grown in your assertiveness, social power, and ability to speak up and say what you need to. You&apos;ve been letting go of guilt and fear as motivators, and are moving into more powerful sources of fuel, like inspiration, excitement, passion, purpose, love, contribution, fun, or anything else you value.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In a sense, you are becoming more you. More and more of who you really are, who you&apos;re meant to be. Let&apos;s see if we can turn that dial up even more, into the realm of <span class="CharOverride-10">Bold Authenticity: Complete freedom and permission to be who you want to be without shame, guilt, fear, or self-condemnation.</span>
 Powerfully, freely, delightfully you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After working with thousands of people over the years, I’ve seen one simple pattern. Regardless of the focus of our sessions — work and business, romantic relationships, friendships, confidence and self-esteem — this pattern was the same for everyone. It didn&apos;t matter whether they were married or single, rich or poor, old or young, it always came down to this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If someone feels like they cannot be themselves, they suffer. Period.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It doesn&apos;t matter how many people love them or admire them, how famous they are, or how much money they&apos;re making. If they aren&apos;t being themselves, stuffing instead of speaking freely, or acting a role that is not congruent with their essence, there will be pain. They may try to push this pain down or ignore it because they don&apos;t want to disturb the status quo, or the relationship. They tell themselves, <span class="CharOverride-9">How could I leave this job when it&apos;s so stable and I get paid so well?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But that pain doesn&apos;t go away. It just goes underground. It comes back as physical symptoms or “injuries” in our bodies. It manifests as apathy, anxiety, depression, negativity, dissatisfaction, or restlessness. All of these might feel uncomfortable or terrible, but they are actually beautiful. They are evidence that the human spirit will not settle for anything other than complete freedom. That you will not settle for anything less than authenticity and the freedom to express yourself in the ways you are meant to.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let&apos;s explore together how you can be more you. 100% you in fact.</p>
