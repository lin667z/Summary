<h4 class="Header-02">How to Disagree with Someone</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">The quintessential nice person move is to smile, nod, and say “yes.” Not in an empowering, I say “yes” to life, have crazy adventures, and face challenges head-on kind of way. More of the “I’m too uncomfortable to say what I really think so I’ll just agree” approach.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I used to avoid disagreeing so much that I never did it. I even had a number of beliefs and philosophies to back me up. I believed it was wrong to disagree. I thought it was just people and their egos battling. I told myself I wanted to be surrounded by “positive people.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But the truth was I was just very uncomfortable with disagreement. I disliked any difference in opinion because this felt like friction and tension, which was the beginning of conflict, anger, and the destruction of all things good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I have since upgraded my perception of human interaction. Disagreement between people is inevitable if both people are being authentic and honest. It is impossible for two humans to have the exact same thoughts, feelings, perceptions, and desires at the exact same time, always.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In short, it’s healthy to disagree with others. Not only do they not crumble or explode, as you might fear, they actually end up respecting you more for being honest, outspoken, and bold.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If, like me, you have spent years not disagreeing, it may take a little practice. But don’t worry, it’s a relatively easy skill to pick up, and becomes quickly reinforcing because you’ll feel so much freer and bolder in all your interactions. Here are some simple ways to effectively disagree with others.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Casual Disagreement</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">When I first decided I was going to give myself permission to disagree with others and be less nice, I studied how confident people pulled it off. I was surprised to discover how casual it could be. It didn’t have to be a dramatic challenge that lead to a showdown. In fact, it appeared other people didn’t have my internal rules, and disagreement was no big deal to them. It was just part of the normal discourse, and conversation would continue to flow smoothly afterwards. Here’s an example to make it clearer:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Them: The biggest thing we have to worry about is the load that this will put on people’s systems. Right now it’s at threshold and if we add anything else, it will become totally worthless.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You: You think so? I think the biggest focus is whether it can do the things users want. People want function over speed.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My developer friends will have to excuse my obviously limited terminology. I dropped out of my Computer Science major in my junior year of college. Details aside, do you see how you can simply share an alternative perspective? No need to push back hard, make a big deal of it, or make them admit they’re wrong and you’re right. You simply state your view in a matter of fact, relaxed way. You can do this with anything, on any topic:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Them</span>
 : I like chocolate ice cream. It’s the best flavor. We should all get chocolate ice cream.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : Ice cream sounds great. I think we should get strawberry.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Casual disagreement is the most common and most important kind of disagreement to learn because it is you simply expressing yourself. You’re sharing what you think, feel, want, and like. It’s a way of being yourself around others and letting them get to know who you are. When you hide this in an attempt to be pleasing or non-offensive, people are left with the vaguely uneasy feeling that they don’t really know you. Sure, you’re nice, but who are you really?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Start practicing casual disagreement whenever you see the opportunity. You might be surprised, just like I was, at how little others react. Instead of getting upset and challenging you, most of the time people don’t even notice and the conversation and connection flows on.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Playful Disagreement</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">This is one of my favorite kinds of disagreement. In this kind, you do point out that you’re disagreeing, but it’s done in a playful way that maintains rapport between you and the other person. This one is partially about what you say, but mostly about how you say it. You indicate you’re not too serious with your voice and body language.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Them</span>
 : That movie was stupid.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : Whaaaat? You didn’t like that movie? I thought it was great.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Them</span>
 : I don’t know… People who are into self-help books are all just looking for someone else to tell them what to do. I think it’s kinda sad.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : Yes, those poor, poor, lost, idiotic fools. <span class="CharOverride-9">(Playful smile)</span>
 Come on, you really think so? As in any reading about how to handle any problem is a bad idea?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The beauty of the playful disagreement is it allows you to clearly disagree with them in a way that reduces tension and opens up a sincerer discussion. You can use whatever your style of humor is to come up with the playful side. Be aware, however, that it must be obvious you are being playful for this to work effectively. If you are dry and sarcastic in your response, it won’t connect you with the other person. Instead, it could come across as derisive or condescending.</p>

<h5 class="Header-03">Direct Disagreement</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Sometimes it is important to directly disagree without being casual or playful about it. We might have to speak up, say what needs to be said, be direct, and get our point across. We may have to stop someone from making a bad decision, stand up for what we believe in, speak out against oppression, or steer the course of a project or relationship. Some matters are serious, important, and require us to disagree, even if it temporarily creates some tension.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When directly disagreeing, there are several important factors. First and foremost, what is your objective? What is the outcome you want? Is it to influence a team’s decision? Is it to make sure something happens in your company, or your life? Or is it about speaking up against something you don’t like, such as racism or a narrow-minded philosophy? Is your goal to make sure they see that they’re wrong and you’re right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When disagreeing, it’s very easy to get sucked into this last arena and have it turn into a battle to win the “I am right” medal. This rarely works, as most people will never admit they’re wrong or rapidly change their viewpoint. Instead, it can be much more empowering and mutually beneficial to have a “side by side” mindset when it comes to differing views. Instead of “I’m right and my ideas are above yours,” or vice versa, our ideas are side by side. My perspective and opinion is over here and look like this. Yours is over there and looks like that. And they are different.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When you eliminate the need to convince the other person they’re wrong, you instantly become more influential and persuasive. If you are disagreeing with someone to influence a decision-maker who’s listening, your impact will rise exponentially. You can focus on the outcome and the needs of the larger whole, and make a more compelling case.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When disagreeing directly, it is essential to be powerful and congruent in your communication. Now is not the time to smile, use softeners and qualifiers, and pull out other people pleasing maneuvers. Now is the time to sound clear, be an authority, and look people in the eye. It’s OK to be nervous or have your heart rate increase. That is normal and expected if it gets tense or the stakes are high. Your goal is to communicate clearly, even if your heart is beating fast. And, as with all things, practice leads to mastery.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You will learn more about how to develop this capacity in yourself in the last part of this book, which is about putting everything you’re learning into action.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Information Gathering</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">There is one more kind of disagreement that is valuable, especially in situations where you’re dealing with someone who is in a senior position. They might hold some authority over you due to job title, years of experience, and so on.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead of coming in swinging, it can be more effective to begin your disagreement by simply asking questions about the process or decision in under scrutiny. As you do this, the flaws in their thinking or concerns they’ve overlooked can become obvious.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Here’s an example to illustrate. Let’s say you’re in a meeting with your boss, who was advised by the director of marketing to use a particular strategy. You don’t think it’s a very good strategy, and you also know it will cause logistical problems. You could say that directly, but if your boss is sold on the idea, he may simply dismiss your perspective and order you to proceed. Here’s how you might use information gathering to challenge the plan:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Boss</span>
 : So we’ll go with Todd’s marketing strategy. I need you to tell your team about it and map out the plan to execute it with Amar <span class="CharOverride-9">(the sales manager)</span>
 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : Got it. Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Boss</span>
 : Sure.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : What’s the length of time we’re planning on using this strategy?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Boss</span>
 : The initial plan is for 6 months. That’s enough time to begin evaluating results, and we can decide to expand it, keep it, or kill it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : Sounds good. And what is the metric for success? What amount of return would tell us it’s going well?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Boss</span>
 : Hmm. An increase in sales by 5% would be good.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : OK, shooting for 5% sales increase. What about the added cost of the creation and management of all the promotional materials?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Boss</span>
 : What about it?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : Well to do Todd’s strategy we would need two people on my team dedicated to creating and managing all the materials. And I’m guessing Amar would need to increase sales calls and hire another rep, right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">Boss</span>
 : Hmm.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-6">You</span>
 : I’m curious about what sales amount would not only cover all increased costs, but also make enough to make it worth it.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">At this point, you can more directly discuss your concerns, or keep asking questions that highlight the flaws in the plan. This method of disagreeing is useful in larger meetings, when speaking with authority figures, or even when exploring a plan that your friend or spouse proposes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The purpose here is not just to persuade. It is information gathering. Essentially, at first you have some concerns and disagree with the approach. If you gather information and it clarifies things and gives you a sense of certainty that the plan is good, you may change your mind. If you ask the tough questions and you see that the other person has not thought everything through, you have opened a door to express your opinion.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So far the difficult conversations we’ve examined assume you are dealing with friends, romantic partners, and colleagues. These are people you are working with, living with, and with whom you are generally on the same team. But what about situations where you are forced to deal with people who are not on your team, people who are actually actively against you? Let’s discover how you can handle that now.</p>
