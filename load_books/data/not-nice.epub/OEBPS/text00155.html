<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Has anyone ever told you to “just be yourself”? Perhaps you were nervous or worried about a meeting, a job interview, or meeting your new girlfriend’s parents. A well-meaning friend says, in an attempt to reassure you, “Relax, you’ll be fine. Just be yourself.” It’s probably sage advice, if we were to follow it. But often, what is our internal reaction to this is advice? To get a little annoyed, right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When people used to tell me that, I would smile and say thanks. Inside I would fume to myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">What the hell does that even mean? Just be yourself. That doesn’t help me at all!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Well, this section is all about just that. Being yourself. Let’s break it down and clarify exactly what that means for you, at this stage of your life, in this moment right now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One of the best ways to do this is to see where you think you should be something other than you are. Take a moment to read that last sentence again. It’s a doozy. Where do you think you should be more like someone else? Heck, in some ways do you tell yourself you should literally <span class="CharOverride-9">be</span>
 somebody else?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No, that’s crazy, right? We would never do anything that crazy, would we?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When I was seven years old my parents bought me one of those miniature basketball hoops. It stood about five feet high, with a solid backboard and realistic looking rim. Just like a real basketball hoop, only smaller. It was amazing. I spent hours playing with that thing – taking three pointers, slam dunking it like crazy, and imagining myself as the hero of the championship game by scoring the most points and, of course, making the game winning shot at the buzzer. It was glorious. Only it wasn’t me.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Aziz was not making all the points and winning the championship game and the love of the imaginary crowds. Andrew McCallister was. Who? Andrew McCallister. This was the name I made up, specifically for this purpose. I didn’t use it anywhere else and I’ve never told anyone about it, until now. But anytime I played sports by myself and imagined an epic victory, it was Andrew.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I would do the voices of the announcers who were calling the play by play of the game. “Andrew McCallister pulls up for another three pointer… and he sinks it. He’s on fire!” (Yes, my play by play was heavily influenced by the video game <span class="CharOverride-9">NBA Jam</span>
 ).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Why did I do this? I had no idea at the time, it just felt right. In some ways, it’s who I wanted to be. I had many different experiences in my life where I was teased heavily or ostracized from a group simply because of my name. “Aziz the disease” one group of kids called me as they turned away to do something that didn’t involve me. I learned that having a “weird” name like Aziz wasn’t cool. It wasn’t what crowds cheered for. It wasn’t the kind of name that won championships and love. So, I changed it. I became someone else. Or at least pretended to be someone else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Oh, little kids are so silly,</span>
 you may be thinking. I wish it were just little kids. We can do this very thing as adults. We have stories about what makes us lovable, valuable, desirable, and significant in the eyes of others. Wealth, cars, a big house, career success, a certain appearance, thinner arms, longer legs, chiseled abs, and on and on. The options for how you “should be” are endless. Then we find someone who represents those qualities and we subtly pressure ourselves to be more like them. An actor, a model, a sports figure, or even a colleague or friend you look up to. I should be more like him or her. In a subconscious way, part of us actually wants to be him or her.</p>
<h5 class="Header-03">Lil’ Tony</h5>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">I didn’t know it, but I was unconsciously wanting to be someone else for literally ten years of my life. When I was twenty-four years old I attended my first Tony Robbins seminar, and I was blown away. I had been studying clinical psychology at Stanford and Palo Alto Universities for two years. It was a prestigious institution and the best psychologists and psychiatrists were training me to help people. Yet, in four days at Tony’s event I had learned more applicable, exciting, and valuable tools than I had in a year of that program.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Tony was confident, certain in himself, and commanded the room. He was certain he could help anyone overcome anything, and he was highly skilled at doing so. He was also willing to demonstrate this to the audience by coaching people live in front of the entire group. It was a life-changing experience and in that moment I knew I wasn’t going to be a clinical psychologist, I was going to be a coach, like Tony. I was going to work with groups of people and help more people, like Tony. I was going to be a leader and a powerful force for good in the world, like Tony. In fact, I decided in that moment (unconsciously) that I was going to <span class="CharOverride-9">be</span>
 Tony.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, for the next ten years, he became the gold standard in my head. While it was inspiring and set me on a course that is my destiny, it also had some negative consequences. Because, as you may very well know, I am not Tony Robbins. But I had this underlying pressure to be more, do more, and help people more, in the way that I imagine he could. This led me to frequently feel inadequate after a counseling or coaching session. Even though most of my clients were engaged in our work together and made powerful leaps and bounds in their confidence and lives, part of me wasn’t satisfied. I would think to myself: <span class="CharOverride-9">Tony could have one conversation with this person and everything would transform instantly, forever. They should leave the session out-of-their-mind-excited, elated, and on fire. And I should feel and be that way all the time too.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This pressure I placed on myself was generally not front row, center in my conscious awareness. It was in the background, like a hiss of static or the whir of an air conditioner. Even though I wasn’t fully aware of it, it prevented me from feeling fully satisfied, fulfilled, and happy after sessions. There was always a lingering feeling of anxiety, being unsettled, or that I didn’t quite do it right.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It became much more obvious when I started leading live events. As people flew in from all over the country, and the world, I felt an incredible pressure. I really have to Tony it up now! Every single person here has to have the most, the best, face-melting, earth shattering, permanent-breakthrough-confidence-explosion of all time… all before lunch on the first day.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This strange demand to literally be someone else created excessive expectations, high pressure, and greatly diminished my enjoyment, freedom, and power. In December of 2016, after attending another Tony Robbins event, I was able to see this pattern that had been operating for almost a decade. I saw him very differently than I had ten years ago. Instead of seeing a virtual demigod, I saw him as a human. I appreciated his passion and endless energy to serve humanity. It inspired and motivated me to do more of the same. I also saw him as just another person, making an impact in the world. The need to be exactly like him, and do exactly what he did, in the way he did it, was gone.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I came home with a renewed sense of power and freedom. I don’t have to be any certain way. I don’t have to be anyone other than who I am. I felt happy, joyful, and above all, free. I was able to see my own gifts, my own strengths, and the unique value that I brought. I trusted in myself more and stopped doubting whether I was doing good enough. This radically increased my enjoyment and sense of purpose in sessions and made me more playful, direct, and powerful. I could call things out more honestly and ask challenging questions. I held nothing back.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you’ve been reading this story, I wonder if you’re seeing anyone that you’ve unconsciously been trying to be? Who might you have thought you should be more like? Your brother? Your sister? That popular kid in your high school? That leader in your company or in your field? Who do you constantly compare yourself too, even if you’ve never met them?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Take a few minutes now to reflect on that. Perhaps it will come to you over the next few days, or in a moment when you are walking from one place to another. Or, you might know exactly who it is right now.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Whenever you identify it, and whoever it is... can you let that go? Can you give yourself full permission to be you? No need to pressure, force, drive, or cajole yourself into being just like that person. That pattern might seem like it drives you to be better, but it actually limits you and drains your power over time. Because your ultimate power, influence, ability to impact and love, all come out strongest when you are most aligned with your inner core. The more you are being fully, 100% you, the easier everything becomes.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you let go of the need to be someone else, ask yourself these powerful questions: <span class="CharOverride-9">What about me — what do I bring to the world? What are my unique qualities?</span>
 Let yourself fully see, feel, and know the gifts you bring to the world.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you do this, you fully step into being who you really are, which is a great gift to yourself, and the world. There are two keys to being able to do this effectively, which are: being the authority and letting yourself be known. Let’s explore those now.</p>
