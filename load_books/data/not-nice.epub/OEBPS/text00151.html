 logy Fast</h3>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Cafe Yumm is a local chain here in Oregon that serves healthy bowls with their signature Yumm Sauce. It’s bomb, so it’s one of my favorite places to eat out. The other day I was waiting for my delicious Yumm Bowl with tofu to be prepared as I stood near the ordering line, and I witnessed this interaction.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">A man walked up to the counter to ask one of the cashiers a question.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Excuse me, what is that?” he said, as he pointed at something in his breakfast wrap.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That’s egg,” the cashier said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Oh,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Did you want one without the egg?” she asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No, can I just get a refund?” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Sure, no problem.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As she was poking around on her computer screen, initiating this refund, he must have started to feel uncomfortable. He must have broken a rule.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Sorry. I think I was expecting more of a breakfast burrito kind of thing. I&apos;m sorry.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">He apologized twice in one sentence. It must be an important rule.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No that&apos;s OK,” she reassured him. But she must have broken a rule too, because as she handed him the change she said, “I&apos;m sorry about that.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“No!” He exclaims quickly. “It&apos;s OK.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Everyone’s sorry and everything&apos;s OK. So much niceness in one little exchange. Why all the apologies? <span class="CharOverride-10">Since most people are living by everyone else’s rules, they imagine they’re breaking them all the time, hence all the apologies.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Can you relate to this? Do you have a habit of saying sorry all the time, even when you haven’t done anything wrong? Is it the first thing that pops out of your mouth when you gently touch shoulders walking past a stranger, or when you and a friend start speaking at the same time?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How many times per day do you apologize?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I was recently discussing this with a client and he guessed three to four times per day. We had him count during the next week, just to find out. Guess how many? Ten times per day. One day he noticed he apologized twenty-four times.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And trust me, this guy wasn’t walking around pushing down old ladies and taking kids’ candy money. He wasn’t doing anything that was highly offensive or worth apology. He was just existing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That’s what I’ve found with the excessive apologizing. It’s almost as if we’re apologizing for our existence. It’s as if we’re saying to the world, “I’m sorry for being here. Sorry for bothering you. Sorry for imposing on you with my existence.” Yuck.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You have a right to be here. You belong. You matter. Why? Just because. You exist on this planet and you have a right to be here just as much as anyone else.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To help my client break this habit, I had him go on an apology fast. If you notice that you have a habit of saying sorry all the time, I would suggest the same activity for you. Here’s how it works.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">For the next three to four days, simply count how many times you say sorry per day. It may be high like my client, or it may be much lower, in the one to three range. Whatever it is, just notice it, without judging yourself.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, commit to go on a 10-day apology fast. That means you don’t apologize unnecessarily for ten days. The only time you apologize is in a specific instance where you’ve really reflected on it, and decided that you were out of line. Perhaps you were harsh with your spouse or cranky with your kids. In that case, you can go back to them and say, “I’m sorry I was cranky with you yesterday. You didn’t do anything wrong, I was just irritable.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Aside from those apologies, for the next ten days, eliminate all others. These include favorites such as:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sorry to bother you…</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m sorry, what was that again?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Sorry?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Oh, sorry.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I’m sorry, you go ahead.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It may be difficult at first. In fact, an apology might tumble out of your mouth before you realize it. That’s OK, it’s part of the process.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">My client came back after a week of doing this and shared his report.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“How did it go?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well, it was really hard. I did OK, but not that great,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Oh yeah? What happened?” I said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I got down to about three or four per day. Those ones just came out before I knew it. It’s almost like I couldn’t control it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“From ten to three or four! That’s a seventy percent decrease in just seven days,” I pointed out.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I see this pattern all the time in my clients. They do something big in a short period of time, and then find a way to discount it, as if it were no big deal. I like to point this out and tease people about it, helping them start to own their progress and make them laugh at themselves a bit.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“That’s not good enough, Steve. Seventy percent in seven days. What the hell is that?” I said, smiling.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I know,” he said, laughing. “I’m just amazed at how strong the habit is.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">So, he continued the fast for another several weeks, and soon he was down to zero unnecessary apologies per day. He told me that he was amazed by how much this simple exercise increased his confidence.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I feel more powerful walking around in the world,” he said. “I can look people in the eye and stand up taller. I never realized how afraid I was of upsetting people, and how that was affecting me.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Give it a go. Decide to do it for ten days, then decide if you want to do another ten. Enroll a friend to play the game with you, if you’d like. You just might find that it transforms your sense of confidence, strengthens your internal core, and gives you the power you need to live life fully on your terms.</p>
