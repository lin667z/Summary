<h4 class="Header-02">Bullies and Criticism</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">One major plight of the nice person is to deal with criticism or bullying. For some people this was an unpleasant experience from the past that is relegated to the schoolyard. But for many nice people I’ve spoken with, it unfortunately continues to this day. They may not be shoved in the locker room or overtly threatened, but they do have at least one person in their life who regularly teases, mocks, or criticizes them.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This kind of treatment is different than the teasing banter you may do with your friends or a romantic partner. That kind of teasing involves being connected, and has a playful give and take quality. You’re both in on the game and having fun, even though you’re poking each other a bit.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">What I’m speaking about here is different. It involves someone overtly criticizing you, using a harsh voice, calling you names, mocking you, or otherwise trying to diminish you and make you feel worthless. Sometimes they even have a gang of several cronies, so they can get the attention and approval of others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If this is not something you experience, good. But if you are currently experiencing this, then you know exactly what I’m talking about.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The key to ending this toxic behavior is to first realize that bullies have a form of “bully-dar.” It’s their special unconscious form of radar that allows them to select targets for abuse. They can energetically sense who will take their criticism without fighting back. In other words, they pick nice people.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One client in my Unstoppable Confidence Mastermind was recently struggling with being frequently picked on by one colleague at work. This co-worker would make snide remarks, call my client arrogant, and deride or mock the things he’s interested in and shares with others.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In one of our group calls, he shared one instance when this colleague picked on him yet again, making fun of what he said, his voice tone, and how stupid he sounded.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What did you say to him when he did this?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Well, I had an impulse to tell him off, but I didn’t,” he replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I could have asked him in that moment why he held himself back, but I already knew the answer. And he already knew the answer. So, I tried a different tactic.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I asked the group if anyone there never gets picked on. One group member spoke up right away and said no one ever bullies him.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Why do you think that is?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Because they know I’ll fire back. I’ll dish out more than I take,” he replied confidently.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Great,” I said, smiling to myself. “Let’s have you model how you might respond to the criticism.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The specific scenario involved the bully calling my client arrogant for being a fan of a particular football team, among other things. After he shared the details so we could get a sense of what the bully said, we did a short role play. And sure enough, the client who never got bullied dished it out hard and fast. As soon as the bully finished his statement, he said:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Whatever, man. You think your team is any better? Give me a break. You have no idea what you’re talking about. Get the f**k outta here.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">His tone was dismissive and strong. He definitely wasn’t taking grief from anybody.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“What did you notice about his response?” I asked my first client.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“It was clear and direct,” he replied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Was it nice?” I asked.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Ha, no, definitely not,” he said.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Yeah, it was definitely not nice. It was…” And in that moment, I had an insight. I paused for a moment, mid-sentence, then asked the group, “what’s the opposite of nice?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Powerful,” said the client who doesn’t take any guff.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Being an asshole,” said the client who gets bullied.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">That was it. That explained why he held back, pulled his punches, and let others bully him. It all became clear in that instant.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So, in your model of the world, the opposite of nice is to be an asshole. And nobody wants to be identified as an asshole. So, to speak up, to defend yourself, to strongly and appropriately push back against this guy would make you an asshole, or in other words, a bad person.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I paused for just a moment, then continued. “The opposite of nice is not to be an asshole or mean person. The opposite of nice is to be bold, direct, authentic, and powerful. It’s showing up with the energy and strength that’s needed most in that situation.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">We then went on to do more role-plays where my client practiced holding nothing back. He practiced speaking with strength, conviction, and certainty. At first his tone was timid, hesitant, and soft. Then, as he called it, he decided to become more “stern.” His tone transformed and his attitude went from apologetic and fearful to powerful and dismissive of this bully’s unwarranted criticism.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">When dealing with bullies, the most important step to take is to interrupt the pattern. The old pattern is they mock and ridicule you, and you passively take it in. Or try to smile and play along, hoping it will stop tomorrow. Or you push back in a timid and submissive way, which doesn’t deter the bully.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, interrupt the pattern. Come back with more energy and intensity than the bully is expecting. Put your hand up just as he begins to speak and say in a loud, clear, commanding tone, “Excuse me, Darren, the adults are talking. I’m not in the mood for your high school jokes.” This is so different than anything you’ve probably ever done, it will scramble the hell out of his circuits. If that seems too hard or scary to pull off, practice it fifty times the day before. Say it out loud while you’re making dinner, shout it in your car.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Each time you leave a situation feeling like the bully got the best of you, instead of getting stuck in what you should have done, or how it’s not fair, or feeling helpless, stand up. I mean literally. Stand up from your chair and move your body around. Do some jumping jacks or push-ups. Put on some rock music, or metal, or EDM, or anything else that reminds you that you have power and juice left in you. Shake your body out and start saying out loud what you want to say. Practice it again and again until you wire it into your nervous system. Until it comes out so fast the next time you’re with him that you didn’t even consciously choose to speak up. It just happened.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">OK, it’s time for another pause. Take a moment to breath and notice what you are feeling in your body. You’re learning tons of ideas and strategies about how to be less nice and more powerful, expressive, bold, and free. That can feel exhilarating, and it can also feel scary or overwhelming. That’s OK too. You’re doing great and you’re in the exact right place.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you’re wondering exactly how to apply what you are learning, begin practicing the exercises or techniques that are the most relevant to your life. If you want to have more impact at work and be taken more seriously, practice doing a certainty rant once a day on your way to work, for example. Just pick one activity, one action, one thing you are ready to do, and commit to doing it for the next two weeks. Remember, it is only through action that we reinvent ourselves and set ourselves free.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I also want to remind you that at the end of this book, in Part IV, there is a chapter on taking everything you’re learning and putting it into action, now. It will guide you through a step-by-step process of how to build up your assertiveness and power muscles.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Before we conclude this chapter on speaking up for yourself, I would like to share one more key area where speaking up is absolutely essential for fulfilling relationships and a happy life. And that is the art and the skill of asking for what you want. Not only how to do it, but how to release any lingering guilt about asking others for anything.</p>
