<h4 class="Header-02">Advanced Conversation Strategy:<br/>
7 Steps to Handle Any Situation</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Sometimes we don’t speak up because we’re too scared to in the moment. We know exactly what we want to address, but our body hits the override switch and we stay silent. But sometimes we don’t speak up as often as we’d like simply because we don’t have a clear strategy. If it’s something you haven’t done many times before, you just might be unclear about how to do it effectively.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Below you’ll discover a clear 7-step approach you can take to handle any difficult conversation. These seven steps have come from years of practical research in the field that has been tested with hundreds of clients and thousands of conversations. I’ve seen it help people resolve disputes with their neighbors, manage their employees better, deal with an upset boss, greatly enhance their romantic relationships, and bring them closer to their families and parents. In other words, This Stuff Works (TSW).</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The key with these steps, as with any skill, is practice. Start by reading them over and getting a basic understanding of them. Then begin applying them in all the situations in your life that could benefit from more assertiveness.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 1: I Don’t Like It.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This actually occurs inside of you before you open your mouth to say anything. It involves paying more attention to your own internal response to situations, and then acknowledging and honoring that response instead of dismissing it. If someone you work with always tells you really long stories about his home remodel project, and you feel bored and restless, notice that. If you feel irritated each time your partner behaves a certain way, pay attention to that.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice that moment of internal resistance. It could come as irritation, impatience, or some other internal feeling of: <span class="CharOverride-9">Hey, I don’t like that.</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This is the exact opposite of the nice person&apos;s habit of over accommodating and assuming any dislike or upset is your problem. You might tell yourself to be more patient, more flexible, less judgmental, and more relaxed. <span class="CharOverride-9">I should just let it go and not be so bothered by it.</span>
 This might sound like you aspiring to be a more enlightened person, but it’s actually a sneaky way to avoid conflict.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, notice that internal resistance. It’s trying to tell you something. It may be indicating that there is a need for you to speak up.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 2: What Do I Want?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The next step is to tune into that internal resistance and get curious. Ask yourself: <span class="CharOverride-9">What’s happening here? Why am I upset?</span>
 And, most importantly: <span class="CharOverride-9">What do I want to be different?</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the examples I shared above in Step 1, ask yourself what you want in that conversation where your colleague shares in depth play-by-plays of his remodel decisions. Perhaps you want them to talk about something else, or pause for several moments to just be silent. Maybe you want to be sharing more and you want them to listen.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In the example with your partner, pay attention to the behavior that bothers you. Perhaps they put too many paper bags in a drawer so it makes it hard to open, and you want there to be fewer paper bags. Or, once you slow down and really feel what’s happening inside of you, you realize that it has nothing to do with the paper bags. What you actually want is more of his attention, or you want her to touch you more and hold your hand when you sit on the couch.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Because you read about the power of asking yourself, “What do I want?” earlier in this book, and have been practicing it, your ability to do this step and uncover what you really want will come more and more easily to you.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 3: I Noticed…</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The first two steps are internal preparation for speaking up. This is the first step when you actually open your mouth to say something. And that’s when we come out of the gate swinging, right? Actually, it works much better if you approach the other person from a curious, neutral stance. It’s OK to feel upset inside, but if you charge at them with accusations and hostility, the most natural reaction in the world is going to be defensiveness and fighting back.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead, you can simply point out what you noticed to enter the conversation:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed that you share a lot of the details of your remodel with me…”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed that you like to put paper bags in that drawer…”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed you scheduled eight appointments for Barry this week and only 3 appointments for me.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed I sent an email on Monday and you responded to me on Friday.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are just a few examples among the millions of things you could notice in your interaction. <span class="CharOverride-10">The purpose is to bring up the challenging topic directly in a curious and neutral way.</span>
 Using the phrase “I notice” removes an accusatory tone and allows the other person to be more receptive. Notice how all the examples above are very specific, and devoid of interpretation or judgment. This is a key point that is sometimes difficult to remember when we’re upset about something. Instead, it might come out like this:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed that you just go on and on about your remodel project…”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed that you always stuff that drawer so full of paper bags that we don’t need and never use anyway.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed that you favor Barry and give him way more appointments than me.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I noticed it takes you way too long to get back to me on emails.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Can you see how these are different? They’re loaded with more frustration, judgment, and blame. You can almost hear the unspoken part of the sentence that says, “What the hell is wrong with you?” This tone and language more often than not creates a defensive reaction in the other person, or at the very least makes them less open and receptive to resolving the issue.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve broached the subject, then you can get more information. Why do they do that thing? What happened that it took so long to respond? What’s their idea of what to do with the paper bags? Ask questions and try to understand their model of the world, and why they are doing what they are doing.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Again, tone is important here. You’re not a prosecutor cross-examining a witness: “Why did you give more appointments to Barry? I see. I see. And did you think that was OK to do such a thing? Has anyone ever accused you of being a <span class="CharOverride-9">racist</span>
 ?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-9">Objection your honor!</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Our job here is to actually inquire and find out what’s happening. To see if we can get into their world and gain a better understanding, and to be open to the possibility that our knee-jerk interpretation might be slightly inaccurate. But only slightly, of course. We could never be completely wrong, could we?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 4: Reflect</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">As you are exploring the situation with the other person, slow down and pay attention. As you listen, reflect on what you are hearing to make sure you understand it clearly:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So, you like to have a lot of paper bags around because you can use them for garbage or recycling?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“This remodel is a huge deal for you and your family and it helps to talk it through with someone, is that right?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In certain situations, the other person may challenge what you noticed, stating that didn’t happen. In response, our urge might be to immediately fire back and provide our evidence, but this will only entrench the other person further. Because difficult conversations are not about who has the accurate facts. They’re really about connecting and being heard, which is how people positively influence each other.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Let’s take the example of someone in your office scheduling more appointments for Barry than for you. When you say you noticed they scheduled eight for Barry and three for you, imagine they deny this or have some explanation. In that case, you’d simply restate their explanation:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“So, you were just scheduling people as they came in, with whatever times worked best for them. And you weren’t paying much attention about if it was with me or with Barry. Is that right?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Notice the “is that right?” at the end of several of these examples. That is a simple, yet very powerful question to ask. First, it helps you know that you’re accurately reflecting what they’re saying. If you’re missing key details or misconstruing what they said, they will say “no.” If you are accurate, then they will say “yes.” This has them verbally affirm that you are understanding them, and that you are getting what they are saying, which causes people to be more open and receptive in any discussion. Remember, we all just want to be seen, heard, and understood.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 5: Impact</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Now, <span class="CharOverride-9">this</span>
 is the time you can come in swinging. Finally! I’m still kidding in the sense that accusations and criticisms will never influence someone in the long term, or ultimately feel good to you. But it’s essential to share the impact of their behavior on you, and your reactions. It’s even more important to share what you want and work together to create a powerful agreement that works for you both, which we cover in the following steps.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If you skip this step and the next two, then you just have a 4-step process that makes you a way more skillful, nice person. It won’t feel satisfying to have these conversations because you won’t have fully expressed yourself and the situation won’t feel resolved.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In order to really speak up for ourselves, we must share the impact someone’s behavior is having on us. Are you annoyed? Hurt? Angry? Sad? Disappointed? Feeling insignificant or unwanted? Then say so. Tell the other person what happens inside of you when they do X, Y, or Z.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This step trips many people up. When I work with clients, they’re often with me for the first four steps. It doesn’t involve revealing much and while it’s a little uncomfortable to broach a touchy subject, it still feels relatively safe. Still under control. But this step is where you lose control. You reveal what is actually happening inside of you. You show that you are not some perfect, impenetrable being that no one can get to. Instead, you reveal the truth, and use this as a powerful force for connection and influence.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Just like with the previous steps, be aware of using blaming language that makes the other person bad or wrong. They’re not responsible for your feelings and they didn’t “make you angry.” In fact, it’s worth getting curious about yourself, what buttons they pushed inside of you, and what you may need to address and heal. Instead of blaming, we want to take responsibility for our feelings and simply share what is happening. Here are a few examples to help you get the difference.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“When you put the bags there, I feel agitated. Whenever I try to open the drawer, bags pop out and fall on the ground. I get annoyed and don’t like cleaning it up each time.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“When you go deep into the specific details about your house model, I have a hard time following what you’re saying. It feels like too much to me and I lose interest and feel less connected with you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“When I send out an email that requires a response and you do not respond for days, I feel uncertain about what’s happening. My mind keeps trying to figure out what’s going on and why you’re not responding. I feel frustrated and angry when days go by and I don’t hear back.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How do you feel reading these examples? Excited? Neutral? Scared? Do you feel nervous about saying things like this? These are honest and direct, yet kind ways of expressing our feelings. Notice how I am taking responsibility for my own feelings and reactions and not blaming the other person or calling them names.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">It is also important to be congruent in your voice tone, facial expressions, and body language as you share the impact they’ve had on you. If you’re frustrated or hurting, let it show in your voice and body. Sometimes, in an attempt to soften what we are saying, and not rock the boat, we smile or use a soft tone while sharing our upset. This sends a mixed message and confuses everyone. To see video examples of voice tone and congruence, go to <span class="CharOverride-15">NotNiceBook.com</span>
 .</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This way of communicating is more vulnerable, and thus less common. Many people are too scared to speak this way, so instead they skip this step entirely. Or, they don’t <span class="CharOverride-9">really</span>
 reveal themselves, instead choosing to keep the blame focused on the other person. For example:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“When you put the bags in there it annoys me so much. You keep way more than we need and it makes no sense to me why you want to do that.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I can’t handle listening to you go on and on about this remodel any more. You talk so much about it. It’s all you talk about. You’re obsessed. I’m sick of it.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Your response time is terrible. I’m fed up with you not getting back to me and having such bad communication. Why don’t you respond more quickly?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">These are definitely forms of speaking up for yourself. And they might even sound tough and confident. But they usually do not lead to productive discussions that resolve problems. They end up pushing the other person away, creating defensiveness and tension, and failing to effectively change anyone’s behavior in the long run.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 6: Desire</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Once you’ve stated the impact, you then move on to sharing what you actually want. Since you discovered this in Step 2, it will be a breeze to simply share it out loud. Unless, of course, you have some shame or judgment about what you want. Then you’re screwed. No, I’m kidding. Then it’s just a bit more difficult and requires some willingness to be uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">One desire I had shame and judgment around for years was wanting attention from women. I wanted them to notice me, approve of me, be impressed by me, and want to be with me. However, I imagined if women knew I had this desire, they would see me as needy, insecure, and otherwise repulsive. Hence, I either acted aloof or hoped that if I was charming enough, then women would give me all the attention I wanted.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Flash forward to my relationship with my wife, and there are times I’d want her direct attention. I’d want her to be curious about me, pay attention while I shared something, and give me her input or feedback.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Instead of sharing this desire, however, I would feel ashamed of being so “self-absorbed and needy.” I <span class="CharOverride-9">should</span>
 be more attentive to her, and demand less for myself. I <span class="CharOverride-9">should</span>
 be nicer, right?</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">No. Less nice. More honest.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Say what you want. Say what you don’t want. Share what you would like to be different in the situation. Find the courage to be more direct and vulnerable, and express what you really want.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Baby, I notice I’m missing you right now. I would love to have your attention for just a few minutes. There’s something I’d like to share with you.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">To relate it to the examples from earlier:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“My preference would be to keep just four or five bags in that drawer. That way, it would open easily and not spill out. If you wanted more bags, I would like it if we could keep them downstairs in the laundry room.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I would love to talk with you about more things beyond the remodel. I’m curious what else is going on in your life. I would also like to share about what’s going on in my life and have you listen and ask me questions.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I would prefer it if you responded to emails within 24 business hours. I want more communication in our team, as it helps me know what is going on and feel more connected.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">How do you react as you read these examples? Does that level of directness or vulnerability feel edgy or uncomfortable to you? Good! That’s a sign of increasing your discomfort-tolerance and growth. For many years I had a difficult time expressing anything I wanted directly, for all the nice-person reasons listed earlier in this book.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">But if you’re willing to take the risk, and begin experimenting with taking this step, you might be amazed at how inaccurate your predictions are. Instead of being turned off, offended, upset, and withdrawing from you, people are surprisingly responsive, adaptive, warm, and loving. I believe this is due to the powerful connecting nature of this seven-step process. When we follow these steps, we’re not pushing others away or hiding, we are openly and courageously expressing ourselves to create authentic human connection.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">
<span class="CharOverride-10">Step 7: Powerful Agreement</span>
</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Saying what you want doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get what you want. You’ll often find, however, that simply the act of bringing something up, asking the other person questions, and then sharing what you want makes you feel completely better. In other cases, the behavior is an issue and each time it happens, you feel angry, hurt, or frustrated. In these instances, it’s essential to form a powerful agreement.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">I am a huge fan of agreements and I create them with everyone on my team and all of my clients. Agreements take things out of the realm of secret expectations in my head, and turn them into mutually decided actions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Forming an agreement is simple once you’ve done the step of sharing what you want. You simply ask the other person how that sounds to them. Can they agree to do what you want? Do they have any hesitations or concerns? Do they want to do something different? The key here is to create a conversation that aligns everybody so each person takes ownership moving forward.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">If someone agrees to do something, and they chose to do so because they wanted to, they’re much more likely to do it. If there is no discussion and they simply agree out of fear, then they’re much more likely to drag their feet, resist, “forget,” or otherwise exert their true will.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After stating what you want, follow up with questions to see if that works for them:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“How does that sound to you?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Would you be willing to do it that way?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Is there any reason why you wouldn’t want to?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Is there anything that might get in the way?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">And then, depending on the situation, I might specifically use the word “agreement” to highlight that we’re making an agreement. I personally do this more with team members, colleagues, and clients, rather than in my personal life. It seems to fit better there, and seems a little intense with my wife and friends. Yet I am still creating agreements with them, I just don’t use that word. To continue with the three examples we’ve been using throughout these steps:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This example is involving a spouse or romantic partner:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“My preference would be to keep just four or five bags in that drawer. That way, it would open easily and not spill out. If you wanted more bags, I would like if we could keep them downstairs in the laundry room… How does that sound to you?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">After they respond, you could say, “Would you want to do it another way?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This fully engages them in deciding a solution so they will take ownership and feel inspired to follow the new plan.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">This example involves a colleague at work:</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I would love to talk with you about more things beyond the remodel. I’m curious what else is going on in your life. I would also like to share about what’s going on in my life and have you listen and ask me questions.”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then I’d wait for a moment to see how they react or respond.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“How does that sound to you? Would you be open to that?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The final example is a work example, and I would be more likely to make it clear that we are creating a strong agreement.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“I would prefer it if you responded to emails within 24 business hours. I want more communication in our team, as it helps me know what is going on and feel more connected. Is that something you would be able to do?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, even if they said yes, I would ask more questions.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Does that feel too fast for you?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">“Is there any reason why you wouldn’t be able to do that?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The purpose here would be to flush out any hidden resistance or challenges that might get in the way of them following through with the agreement. As you become less nice and a more bold, authentic, powerful leader in your life you will start to see just how many other people are overly nice, scared to speak directly, and afraid of your disapproval.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Then, I would conclude with, “Great. So we can make an agreement that you will respond to my emails within 24 hours on business days?”</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Approaching any challenging situation or difficult conversation using this seven-step strategy will radically increase your ability to speak up. First, it gives you a clear how-to, which provides a sense of certainty and makes it easier to take action. Second, following these steps will generally produce much better outcomes. Even if you don’t pull off all the steps perfectly, you’ll feel better having brought up the subject and been able to address a challenge head on. The more you practice this, the greater your confidence will become, and the easier it will be to speak up, thus creating a positive cycle that moves you forward.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Before we move on to asking for what you want without guilt, there is one kind of difficult conversation that can be particularly challenge for recovering nice people. And that is disagreeing with others. Let’s explore that now.</p>
