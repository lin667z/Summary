<h4 class="Header-02">Choose It</h4>
<p class="body-paragraph ParaOverride-3">Discomfort is inevitable in life. No matter how safe, predictable and small we might try to keep our lives, we can’t escape. Even if you avoid all of the items from the list above, play it extra nice, and avoid all risks, you’ll still get uncomfortable.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">You will become stagnant, stuck, and bored with your life. You’ll feel the pain and discomfort of life passing you by, and living on the sidelines. You’ll also feel the discomfort of living a fearful, sedentary life–low energy, weight gain, fewer deep connections, and a lack of love in your life.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">On the other hand, you can avoid these kinds of discomforts by choosing another kind. <span class="CharOverride-10">You can experience the discomfort of taking healthy risks, moving towards what you want, being authentic, and taking life on.</span>
 That brings a whole new set of discomforts with it – fear, doubt, guilt, uncertainty. But unlike the first kind, these discomforts are like working out: uncomfortable in the short term, but liberating in the long term. When you voluntarily confront discomfort, you become stronger, more resilient, and powerful.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">In fact, some part of you knows it’s right to face discomfort. It can actually feel good as well as uncomfortable when you say no, speak up for yourself, or ask for what you want. That’s the entire point. To be able to take action, and do what you want, in spite of fear or others’ feelings. This is freedom.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Many people I speak with have this as their goal: I want to feel comfortable speaking in groups, or getting closer with others, or sharing myself more freely, or approaching someone I find attractive. I think these are great goals, but I always tell them that comfort is the last result.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">Action comes first. It usually goes something like this: Let’s say your goal is to be more comfortable speaking in groups. First, you speak up in groups, and it’s uncomfortable. You feel nervous, and maybe a little clunky or awkward. Then, eventually, when you speak up it becomes smoother, but you still feel nervous inside. Then, finally, you speak up in groups <span class="CharOverride-9">and</span>
 it’s smooth <span class="CharOverride-9">and</span>
 you feel relaxed. Comfort is a long way off, I’m afraid. And if comfort is a prerequisite for action, then you will never take action.</p>
<p class="body-paragraph">The same is true for every single one of the Not Nice Pillars. Each one will be awkward and uncomfortable, then externally smooth but internally uncomfortable, then externally smooth and internally relaxed. There is no magic way around this process. Of course, by doing inner work, changing your beliefs, using the peace process and other tools from this book, you can lessen the discomfort and increase your capacity to take healthy action. But instant and complete comfort from the get-go is not an option.</p>
